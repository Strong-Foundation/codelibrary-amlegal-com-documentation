10-19-1999)
1-11-3: PRUDENCE:
Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in
the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of their capital, as well as the probable
income to be derived. The standard of prudence to be used by investment
officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the
context of managing an overall portfolio. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-4: OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
   A.   Legality: Conformance with Federal, State and other legal requirements.
   B.   Safety: Preservation of capital and protection of investment principal.
   C.   Liquidity: Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements.
   D.   Yield: Attainment of market rates of return.
   E.   Review: The portfolio should be reviewed periodically as to its
effectiveness in meeting the Village's needs for safety, liquidity, rate of
return, diversification and its general performance. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-5: DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY:
Management and administrative responsibility for the investment program is
hereby delegated to the Treasurer who, under the delegation of the Board of
Trustees, shall establish written procedures for the operation of the
investment program. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-6: ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and
management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to
make impartial decisions. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-7: AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL DEALERS AND INSTITUTIONS:
The Treasurer will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to
provide investment services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of

10-19-1999)
1-11-8: AUTHORIZED AND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS:
Investments may be made in any type of security allowed for in Illinois
statutes regarding the investment of public funds. Investments shall be made
that reflect the cash flow needs of the fund type being invested. (Ord. 99-533,
10-19-1999)
1-11-9: COLLATERALIZATION:
Funds on deposit (checking accounts, certificates of deposit, etc.) in excess
of FDIC limits must be secured by some form of collateral, witnessed by a

name of the Village. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-10: SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY:
All security transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements,
entered into by the Village, shall be conducted on a delivery-versus-payment
(DVP) basis. Securities will be held by an independent third party custodian
designated by the Treasurer and evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written
custodial agreement. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-11: DIVERSIFICATION:
The Village shall diversify its investments to the best of its ability based on
the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of those funds.
Diversification can be by type of investment, number of institutions invested
in, and length of maturity. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-12: MAXIMUM MATURITIES:
To the extent possible, the Village shall attempt to match its investments with
anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the
Village will not directly invest in securities maturing more than ten (10)
years from the date of purchase. Reserve funds may be invested in securities
exceeding ten (10) years if the maturity of such investments are made to
coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of the funds. (Ord. 99-
533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-13: INTERNAL CONTROL:
The Treasurer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal
control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the Village are

   A.   Control of collusion.
   B.   Separation of transaction authority from accounting.
   C.   Custodial safekeeping.
   D.   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and wire
transfers. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-14: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
This investment portfolio will be managed in accordance with the parameters
specified within this policy. The portfolio should obtain a comparable rate of
return during a market/economic environment of stable interest rates. Portfolio
performance should be compared to bench marks with similar maturity, liquidity
and credit quality as the portfolio. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-15: REPORTING:
The Treasurer shall prepare an investment report at least monthly. The report
should be provided to the Board of Trustees and available on request. The
report should be in a format suitable for review by the general public. An
annual report should also be provided to the Board. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-16: MARKING TO MARKET:

of Trustees quarterly. (Ord. 99-533, 10-19-1999)
1-11-17: POLICY REVIEW:
The investment policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis by the Treasurer and
any modifications made thereto must be approved by the Board of Trustees. (Ord.

testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit or
assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 9.5
percent per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days and
the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 2000-
570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-11: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-12: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-13: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of
the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years after the end of the calendar
year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar
year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-14: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-
2000)
1-12-15: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-16: INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-17: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)
1-12-18: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, paragraph or provision of this chapter shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or unenforceability of
such section, paragraph or provision shall not affect any of the remaining
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2000-570, 12-5-2000)

1-13-6: INSTITUTING CODE HEARING PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   Code Violations Other Than Building Or Parking, Standing Or Compliance
Violations:
      1.   When a compliance administrator finds that a code violation exists,
that individual shall note the violation on a multiple copy violation notice
that indicates the following:
         a.   The name and address of the alleged violator;
         b.   The type and nature of the violation;
         c.   The date and time the violation was observed; and
         d.   The names of witnesses to the violation.
      2.   The violation form shall be forwarded to the code hearing department
where a docket number shall be stamped on all copies of the report and a
hearing date shall be noted in the blank spaces provided for that purpose on
the form. The hearing date shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than
forty (40) days after the violation is reported.
      3.   One copy of the violation report form shall be maintained in the
files of the code hearing department and shall be part of the record of
hearing, one copy of the report form shall be returned to the individual
representing the municipality so that he or she may prepare evidence of the
code violation for presentation at the hearing, and one copy of the report form
shall be served by first class mail to the defendant along with a summons
commanding the defendant to appear at the hearing 1 .
      4.   After expiration of the period within which judicial review under
the administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the
code violation, the village may commence a proceeding in said circuit court for
the purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision and order.
Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from consolidating multiple
findings, decisions and orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon
commencement of the action, the village shall file a certified copy of the
findings, decision and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification
that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision and order was
issued in accordance with the applicable municipal ordinance. Service of the
summons and a copy of the petition may be made by any method provided for by
section 2-203 of the code of civil procedure or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines, other sanctions and
costs imposed by the findings, decision and order does not exceed two thousand
five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). If the court is satisfied that the findings,
decision and order was entered in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter and 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-2.2-1 et seq., and that the
defendant had an opportunity for a hearing under this chapter and for judicial
review as provided:
         a.   The court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality and
against the defendant for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and
order, plus costs;
         b.   The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in
the same manner as other judgments for recovery of money; and
         c.   The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that
are requested by the village to enforce the order of the hearing officer to
correct a code violation 2 .
   B.   Building Code Violations:
      1.   Violation Notice: When a compliance administrator finds a code
violation while inspecting a structure or property, he or she shall note the
violation on a multiple copy violation notice indicating:
         a.   The name and address of the structure;
         b.   The type and nature of the violation;
         c.   The date and time the violation was observed;
         d.   The names of witnesses to the violation; and
         e.   The address of the structure or property where the violation is
observed.
      2.   Service: The violation report form shall be forwarded to the code
hearing department and a docket number shall be stamped on all copies of the
report and a hearing date shall be noted on the form. The hearing date shall
not be less than thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days after the violation
is reported. One copy of the violation report shall be maintained in the files
of the code hearing department and shall become part of the record of the
hearing. One copy of the report shall be returned to the individual issuing the
code violations. One copy of the report form shall be served by first class
mail to the defendant along with a summons commanding the defendant to appear
on the specified hearing date.
If the name of the owner of the structure cannot be ascertained or if service
on the owner cannot be made by mail, service may be made on the owner by
posting or nailing a copy of the violation report form on the front door of the
structure where the violation is found, not less than twenty (20) days before
the hearing is scheduled 3 .
      3.   Defenses To Building Code Violations: It shall be a defense to a
building code violation charged if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent
or representative proves to the hearing officer's satisfaction that:
         a.   The building code violation alleged in the notice does not in
fact exist, or at the time of the hearing, the violation has been remedied or
removed;
         b.   The building code violation has been caused by the current
property occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to
maintain the dwelling free of such violations, the current occupants continue
to cause the violations; and
         c.   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
owner or his agent to all or part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting
the building code violation.
      4.   Sanctions Applicable To Owner; Property: The order to correct a
building code violation and the sanction imposed by the village as the result
of a finding of a building code violation under this chapter shall attach to
the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a
building code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or
transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner
of property takes subject to the findings, decision and order of a hearing
officer under this chapter.
   C.   Parking, Standing Or Compliance Notice Violations:
      1.   Specifications: A parking, standing or compliance violation notice
shall:
         a.   Specify the date, time and place of violation of a parking,
standing, or compliance regulation;
         b.   Specify the particular regulation violated;
         c.   Specify the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late
payment, when so provided by ordinance;
         d.   Specify the vehicle make and state registration number;
         e.   Specify the identification number of the person issuing the
notice;
         f.   State that payment of the indicated fine and of any applicable
penalty for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of the
violation;
         g.   Contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which
the violation may be contested on its merits;
         h.   Specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had 4 .
Service: Service of the parking, standing or compliance violation notice may be
achieved by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully
parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he/she
is present. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking,
standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness
of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his/her name to the
notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a
computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic
compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced
by the device while it was under his/her control. The original or a facsimile
of the violation notice shall be retained by the traffic compliance
administrator and there shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of
business. A parking, standing, or compliance violation notice issued, signed
and served in accordance with this section, or a copy of the notice, shall be
prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the
facts shown on the notice. The notice or copy shall be admissible in any
subsequent administrative adjudication or legal proceedings 5 .
Service of additional notices may be sent by first class United States mail,
postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as
recorded with the secretary of state, or, under section 11-1306 of the Illinois
vehicle code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to
the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease. The service shall be
deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The
notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include, but not be
limited to, the information specified herein:
      2.   Second Notice Of Violation: This notice shall:
         a.   Specify the date and location of the violation cited in the
parking, standing or compliance violation notice;
         b.   Specify the particular regulation violated;
         c.   Specify the vehicle make and state registration number;
         d.   Specify the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late
payment when so provided by ordinance;
         e.   Specify the availability of a hearing in which the violation may
be contested its merits;
         f.   Specify the time and manner in which the hearing may be had;
         g.   State that failure either to pay the indicated fine and any
applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and
manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability
for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated;
         h.   State that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of
violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to
exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid
fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the village of Wadsworth.
      3.   Notice Of Final Determination Of Parking, Standing, Or Compliance
Violation Liability: This notice shall be sent following a final determination
of parking, standing, or compliance violation liability and the conclusion of
judicial review procedures taken under this section. The notice shall:
         a.   State that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing the
municipality; and
         b.   Contain warnings that failure to pay any fine or penalty due and
owing the municipality within the time specified may result in the
municipality's filing a petition in the circuit court to have the unpaid fine
or penalty rendered a judgment as provided by this section, or may result in
suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or
penalties for ten (10) or more parking violations under section 6-306.5 of the
Illinois vehicle code 6 .
      4.   Notice Of Impending Driver's License Suspension: A notice of
impending driver's license suspension shall:
         a.   Be sent to the person liable for any fine or penalty that remains
due and owing on ten (10) or more parking violations;
         b.   State that failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within forty
five (45) days of the notice's date will result in the municipality notifying
the secretary of state that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension
proceedings under section 6-306.5 of the Illinois vehicle code;
         c.   State that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an
original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self- addressed,
stamped envelope to the municipality along with a request for the copy; and
         d.   Be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to
the address recorded with the secretary of state 7 .
      5.   Hearings On Standing, Parking And Condition Of Vehicles: An
opportunity for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle cited in the
parking, standing or compliance violation notice in which the owner may contest
the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules
of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under section 11-1306 of
the Illinois vehicle code, the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation
notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind
afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person
conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall
be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance
and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers.
Persons appearing at a hearing under this section may be represented by counsel
at their expense 8 .
      6.   Final Determinations Of Violation Liability: A final determination
of violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty
after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the
exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, any administrative review procedures
provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest
the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed
notice, the hearing officer's determination of violation liability shall become
final:
         a.   Upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination;
or
         b.   Upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a
filing having been made 9 .
A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing or liability may
be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty and shall be filed within
thirty (30) days of the finding of liability and ruled upon by the compliance
administrator within thirty (30) days thereafter. The grounds for such a
petition are limited to: a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of
the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued; b) the person
having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question; and c)
excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. After the
determination of violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just
cause, the person owing the unpaid fine or penalty shall be provided with a
hearing on the merits for the violation 10 .
      7.   Procedures For Nonresidents: If the alleged violator does not reside
within the state of Illinois, he or she may contest the violation in writing.
In such circumstances, the hearing officer must receive a request in writing
from the nonresident to contest the violation seven (7) days prior to the
initial hearing. If the hearing officer receives such a written request, the
nonresident may submit his or her position, in writing, as to why the issuance
of the violation was improper 11 . (Ord. 2008-752, 2-5-2008)

CHAPTER 15
FUND BALANCE POLICY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GASB #54
SECTION:
1-15-1: Background And Purpose
1-15-2: Definitions And Policies
1-15-1: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   A.   Background: In February 2009, the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board (GASB) issued GASB #54 Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type
Definitions. The statement substantially changes how fund balances are
categorized. It clarifies/modifies how some of the governmental funds are
presented and classified.
   B.   Purpose: To provide a stable financial environment for the Village of
Wadsworth (hereinafter, referred to as "Village") operations that allows the
Village to provide quality services to its residents in a fiscally responsible
manner designed to keep services and taxes as consistent as possible over time.
This Fund Balance Policy is meant to serve as the framework upon which
consistent operations may be built and sustained. (Ord. 2020-1088, 7-7-2020)
1-15-2: DEFINITIONS AND POLICIES:
The following terms shall apply to this chapter as written unless context
indicates or requires a different meaning:
             The assigned fund balance is the portion of the spendable fund balance that
             reflects funds intended to be used by the government for specific purposes
             assigned by more informal operational plans (e.g., capital goods replacement, the
             constraint on use is not imposed by external parties or by formal Board action).
ASSIGNED     In governmental funds other than the General Fund (e.g., Special Revenue Funds,
FUND         Capital Project Funds, Debt Service Funds and permanent funds), assigned fund
BALANCE:     balance represents the amount that is not restricted or limited. The authority to
             "assign" fund balance is delegated to the Village Treasurer and Village
             Administrator; the Village Board shall approve same prior to any final action
             being taken on the Village's Audited Financial Statements and Annual Treasurer's
             Report for the given fiscal year.
             At the end of each fiscal year, the Village Treasurer and Village Administrator
CAPITAL      will report "assigned" fund balance for equipment replacement according to the
GOODS        Village Capital Improvement Plan. The Village Board shall approve same prior to
REPLACEMENT: any final action being taken on the Village's Audited Financial Statements and
             Annual Treasurer's Report for the given fiscal year.
             A.   At the end of each fiscal year, the village will maintain spendable
             unassigned portions of the fund balance for cash flow in a range equal to 25-50%
             of the General Fund operating expenditures. In addition to the cash flow needs,
             this accommodates emergency contingency concerns.
             B.   In the event that amounts designated for cash flow fall above or below the
             desired range, the Treasurer shall report such amounts to the Board of Trustees
CASH FLOW:   as soon as practical after the end of the fiscal year. Should the actual amount
             designated for cash flow fall below the desired range, the Village shall create a
             plan to restore the appropriate levels. Should the actual amount designated for
             cash flow rise above the desired range, any excess funds will remain undesignated
             pending the Board's final decision concerning transfer to another fund. It is the
             policy of the Village that such excess funds will be, by Board action, reported
             in the spendable limited category of this Policy.
             A.   The committed fund balance classification includes the portion of the
             spendable fund balance that reflects constraints that the village has imposed
             upon itself by a formal action of the Board of Trustees (for example, an
COMMITTED    ordinance or resolution passed by the Board of Trustees). This constraint must be
FUND         imposed prior to year-end, but the amount can be determined at a later date.
BALANCE:     B.   Policy: Prior to the end of each fiscal year, the Village will report
             "committed" fund balance for long-term loan receivables, such as advances to
             other funds and similar accounts, including the Wadsworth Farmer's Market
             checking account.
FUND         Fund balance is the difference between assets and liabilities in governmental
BALANCE:     funds (i.e., general fund, special revenue funds, capital project funds, debt
             service funds and permanent funds).
             A.   Describes the amount of a fund balance that cannot be spent because it is
NON-         either not in spendable form or there is a legal or contractual requirement for
SPENDABLE    the funds to remain intact.
FUND         B.   Policy: At the end of each fiscal year, the Village will report the portion
BALANCE:     of the fund balance that is not in spendable form as Non-Spendable Fund Balance
             on the financial statements.
             A.   The restricted fund balance category includes the portion of the spendable
             fund balance that reflects constraints on spending because of legal restrictions
             stipulated by outside parties (e.g., encumbrances for goods or services with
RESTRICTED   outside parties, creditors, grantors, outstanding at the end of the year); also,
FUND         any legal restrictions based on state statutes or grant requirements placed on
BALANCE:     the use for specific purposes.
             B.   Policy: At the end of each fiscal year, the Village will report "restricted"
             fund balance for amounts that have applicable legal restrictions per GASB #54. In
             addition, encumbrances or funds restricted by enabling legislation will be
             reported as "restricted."
             A.   Describes the amount of fund balance that is available for appropriation
             based on the constraints that control how specific amounts can be spent.
SPENDABLE    Typically, a significant portion of a government's spendable resources can be
FUND BALANCE spent only for specified purposes. The following categories define the revenue
(OVERVIEW):  source and the level of force of the constraint on spending.
             B.   Categories should be supported by actual plans approved by either the
             governing body, an appropriate officer, grant providers or enabling legislation.
             This is the residual classification for the government's General Fund and
             includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications and,
             therefore, not subject to any constraints. Unassigned amounts are available for
             any purpose. These are the current resources available for which there are no
UNASSIGNED:  governmental self-imposed limitations or set spending plan. Although there is
             generally no set spending plan for the undesignated portion, there is a need to
             maintain a certain funding level. Undesignated fund balance is commonly used for
             emergency expenditures not previously considered. In addition, the resources
             classified as undesignated can be used to cover expenditures for revenues not yet
             received. (Ord. 2020-1088, 7-7-2020)

provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end

owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,

at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.

collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2003-643, 11-4-2003, eff. 7-1-2004)

act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and
regulations created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 2003-643, 11-
4-2003, eff. 7-1-2004)
3-9-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale
number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2003-643, 11-4-2003, eff.
7-1-2004)
3-9-6: SEVERABILITY:
If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision of this
chapter, is held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such occurrence shall
not affect other provisions of this chapter, or their application, that can be
given effect without the unconstitutional or invalid provision or its
application. Each unconstitutional or invalid provision, or application of such
provision, is severable, unless otherwise provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2003-

this chapter had not been adopted. (Ord. 2003-643, 11-4-2003, eff. 7-1-2004)
3-9-8: REPEALER:
Chapter 7 of this title is hereby expressly repealed effective July 1, 2004,
provided however that if public act 92-0526, entitled the simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act, is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason,
or if this chapter is repealed or becomes ineffective for any reason, then
chapter 7 of this title shall not be repealed and shall be deemed in full force
and effect as of the date public act 92-0526 or this chapter is repealed or

3-11-1: PURPOSE AND FINDINGS:
   A.   Title: This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the WADSWORTH
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENT LICENSING ORDINANCE.
   B.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
adult entertainment establishments within the village in order to promote the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village. The provisions of
this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation
or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication,
including adult entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult entertainment
protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by distributors and
exhibitors of adult entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is
not the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene.
   C.   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of
adult entertainment establishments presented to the village from findings
incorporated in the cases of City Of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120
S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City Of
Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986) Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Berg v. Health And Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d
797 (7th Cir. 1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir.
1982); Bamon Corp v. City Of Dayton, 730 F.Supp 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990) and EWAP
Inc. v. City Of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App 3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on
studies in other cities including the "Report Of The Attorney General's Working
Group On The Regulation Of Adult Entertainment Establishments" (Minnesota,
1989); "Memorandum Re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance", of the assistant chief
of police of Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., "Report To
The American Center For Law And Justice On The Secondary Impacts Of Sex
Oriented Businesses" (March 31, 1996); "Adult Entertainment Businesses In
Indianapolis, An Analysis" (1984) and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker,
James W., Ph.D., "Final Report To The City Of Garden Grove: The Relationship
Between Crime And Adult Business Operations On Garden Grove Boulevard" (Garden
Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), this legislative body finds:
      1.   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities.
      2.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      3.   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      4.   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      5.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
the areas of adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult films
concealed from public view.
      6.   The findings noted in subsections C1 through C5 of this section
raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns.
      7.   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the compelling and
substantial governmental interests in protecting the public health, safety, and
welfare.
      8.   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that adult
entertainment establishments are run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee
is the actual operator of the adult entertainment establishment, and fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      9.   The regulation of nudity, seminudity, and physical contact between
employees and patrons in adult entertainment establishments will further the
compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution
and other sex related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      10.   Requiring open sight lines in adult entertainment establishments
and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult entertainment establishments and will facilitate enforcement
of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws,
thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      11.   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of adult entertainment
establishments, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and
local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
      12.   A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in an adult
entertainment establishment.
      13.   Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent
to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      14.   A reasonable licensing procedure for adult entertainment
establishments assists the village in preventing the adverse secondary effects
of such businesses on property values, the prevention of crime, and the public
health. (Ord. 2010-809, 4-6-2010)

procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the Village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by establishing uniform standards to address
issues presented by small wireless facilities and utility facilities, including
without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities including underground drain (field) tiles and of other
utilities lawfully located in rights-of- way or public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the wireless provider or utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
Federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating Federal or State laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may exercise the power described
in section
7-2-21 of this chapter to vary the standards, conditions, and requirements
expressed in this chapter when the Village so determines. Nothing herein shall
be construed to limit the ability of the Village to regulate its rights-of-way

   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each wireless provider or utility occupying
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and
maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as
named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed
in subsection A1 of this section.
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
         d.   Wireless providers must include the Village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy;
         e.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
         f.   Property insurance for replacement costs against all risks.
If the wireless provider or utility is not providing such insurance to protect
the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors
and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The wireless provider or utility shall provide copies
of any of the policies required by this section to the Village within ten (10)
days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Village Clerk of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.
 
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A wireless provider or utility may self-insure all or a
portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection
A of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent
of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of
subsections B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a
"private self-insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Wireless Provider's Or
Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the wireless provider or utility to
the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
(Ord. 2018-1043, 7-5-2018)
7-2-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a wireless
provider or utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to
arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction
of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the wireless provider's or utility's
indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting
from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the Village, its
officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 2018-1043, 7-
5-2018)
7-2-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village with a rating of AM Best A+ or better, or an
unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety
bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a
minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this subsection C for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2018-1043, 7-
5-2018)
7-2-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   Village Right To Revoke Permit: The Village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      2.   Non-compliance with this chapter;
      3.   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      4.   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   B.   Notice Of Revocation Or Suspension: The Village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this section.

Suspension: Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      1.   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      2.   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      3.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this subsection.
   D.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection A of
this section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the Village or
its designee may, at the option of the Village: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2)
upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the Village. The permittee shall be liable in all
events to the Village for all costs of removal. (Ord. 2018-1043, 7-5-2018)
7-2-12: CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS:
   A.   Notification Of Change: A utility shall notify the Village no less than
thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village's right-
of-way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 2018-1043,
7-5-2018)
7-2-13: GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:
   A.   Standards And Principles: All construction in the right- of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from
time to time:
      1.   Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction;
      2.   Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special Provisions;
      3.   Highway Design Manual;
      4.   Highway Standards Manual;
      5.   Standard Specifications for Traffic Control Items;

      8.   Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight Maintenance Operations.
   B.   Interpretation Of Municipal Standards And Principles: If a discrepancy
exists between or among differing principles and standards required by this
chapter, the Village Engineer shall determine, in the exercise of sound
engineering judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be final.
If requested, the Village Engineer shall state which standard or principle will
apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the
future. (Ord. 2018-1043, 7-5-2018)
7-2-14: PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL:
   A.   Public Safety: The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small
wireless facilities located in the Village right-of-way may not interfere with
the frequencies used by public safety agencies for public safety
communications. Unacceptable interference will be determined in accordance with
industry standards and the Federal Communications Commission's regulations
addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum. If an antenna,
wireless facility or small wireless facility causes such interference, the
owner must take all steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference
at its own costs. The Village may terminate a permit for any antenna, wireless
facility or small wireless facility based on such interference if the
interference is not corrected.
The Village may reserve space on its utility pole for future public safety uses
or for the Village's electric utility uses. This reservation of space may
preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility where the Village
determines that the utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
   B.   Minimum Requirements: The Village's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control
Devices and this Code.
   C.   Warning Signs, Protective Devices, And Flaggers: The wireless provider
or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs,
protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable Federal,
State, and local requirements for protection of the public and the utility's
workers when performing any work on the rights-of-way.
   D.   Interference With Traffic: All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   E.   Notice When Access Is Blocked: At least forty eight (48) hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and
duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency
repairs pursuant to section
7-2-20 of this chapter, the wireless provider or utility shall provide such
notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
   F.   Compliance: The wireless provider or utility shall take immediate
action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are
brought to its attention by the Village. (Ord. 2018-1043, 7-5-2018)
7-2-15: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   General Requirements: In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With Village Facilities: No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the Village Engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the Village's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the Village's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      4.   No Limitations On Visibility: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      5.   Size Of Utility Facilities: The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
      6.   Village Not Required To Install Or Maintain Utility Poles: The
Village is not required to install or maintain any specific utility pole or to
continue to install or maintain utility poles in any location if it makes a
non- discriminatory decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a
particular type. For Village utility poles with collocated small wireless
facilities in place when the Village makes a decision to eliminate above-ground
utility poles, the Village will, at its discretion, either maintain the utility
pole or install and maintain an alternative utility pole for the collocation of
the small wireless facility, or offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless
provider.
   B.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways:
      1.   Overhead Parallel Facilities: An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of- way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         b.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (2') (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         c.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (4') (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         d.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         e.   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (1')
(0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way
line.
      2.   Underground Parallel Facilities: An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         a.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.
      4.   Overhead Power Or Communication Facility: An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         b.   Poles are located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right-of-
way line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         c.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      5.   Underground Power Or Communication Facility: An underground power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         a.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         b.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
   D.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights-Of-Way: The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   E.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   Small Wireless Facilities:
         a.   The Village may not require the placement of a small wireless
facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the
application necessitate the installation of a new utility pole, the Village may
propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the
proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated
collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location will
not satisfy the wireless provider's needs. The Village may require any
monopole, utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-
of-way to be screened from view in compliance with the appearance standards
described below.
         b.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right- of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
      2.   Other Facilities:
         a.   The Village may restrict the location and size of any monopole,
utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way may be constructed or
modified so that the height of the free standing facility is higher by more
than ten feet (10') or more than ten percent (10%), whichever is greater, than
any other existing, freestanding facility located within the right-of-way
within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility, measured along the
center line of the respective right-of-way. Where there are no other
freestanding facilities located within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed facility, the maximum height of the freestanding facility shall be
forty five feet (45').
         b.   The Village may require any monopole, utility pole or other
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.
         c.   If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right- of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
   F.   Height Restrictions For Small Wireless Facilities: Small wireless
facilities are limited to a maximum height of ten feet (10') above the utility
pole or wireless structure on which it is collocated. The height limit of a new
or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure on which small
wireless facilities are collocated is limited to the higher of: 1) ten feet
(10') higher than the tallest existing utility pole within three hundred feet
(300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
that is in the same right-of-way; or 2) forty five feet (45') above ground
level. The Village shall designate which intersecting right-of-way within three
hundred feet (300') of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure
shall control the height limitation.
   G.   Facilities Installed Above Ground: Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      3.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and Municipally-owned infrastructure shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles or
monopoles is strongly discouraged.
   H.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         f.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         g.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         h.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   I.   Design And Appearance Standards:
      1.   The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
      3.   Small wireless facilities:
         a.   Residential Design Standards:
            (1)   Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to
provide discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless
facilities.
            (2)   Applicability: These design standards shall apply to each
facility located in a district zoned for residential uses:
               (A)   Applicants must use architectural treatments and stealth
techniques to reduce potential visual impacts from all small wireless

a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of- way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and

would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.

otherwise provided, any other ordinance, rule or regulation of the village with
respect to the activity in question, applications for permits shall be filed
with the village administrator or designated alternate at the village's
administrative offices located at 14155 West Wadsworth Road in Wadsworth,
Illinois. All permit applications and recipients shall be at least twenty one
(21) years of age at the time of application; proof of age shall be required.
(Note: The person making the application need not be present at the scheduled
event, but will be held responsible and liable for any and all activities that
take place in conjunction with said permitted event.) All reservations must be
made in person with only one reservation accepted per person for any particular
day.
      2.   Application Fee: For any activity requiring a permit, the village
board may establish an application fee. If such a fee is established, no permit
may be granted unless the fee is paid at the time of filing the application.
The fee shall be based on and related to the amount it takes to process the
application as determined and set by the village board.
      3.   Indemnification And Reimbursement Agreement: No application for
permit shall be granted unless the applicant shall have executed an agreement
with the park, on a form to be prescribed by the village, in which the
applicant shall promise and covenant to bear all costs of policing, cleaning up
and restoring the park property upon conclusion of the event or activity; to
reimburse the village for any such costs incurred by the village; and to
indemnify the village and hold the village harmless from any liability to any
person resulting from any damage or injury occurring in connection with the
permitted event proximately caused by the action of the permittee, the
sponsoring organization, its officers, employees or agents or any person under
their control insofar as permitted by law.
      4.   Security Deposit: For any activity requiring a permit, no
application for permit shall be granted unless the same shall be accompanied by
the deposit of a sum of money equal to the estimated cost of policing, cleaning
up and restoring the park property upon conclusion of the use or activity, as
set by the schedule of fees set by the village. A security deposit shall not be
required for events wherein the estimated cost thereof is estimated to be less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Promptly after the conclusion of a permit
activity, the village shall inspect the premises and equipment used by the
permittee. If it is determined by such inspection, that the permitted event
proximately caused damage to park property in excess of normal wear and tear
and which requires repairs in excess of routine maintenance or determined that
fines should be assessed against the permittee pursuant to this chapter, the
village shall retain the security deposit or any portion thereof necessary to
pay for the cost of repair or any fines assessed against the permittee. The
village administrator or his designee shall give written notice of the
assessment of damages or fine and retention of the security deposit to the
permittee by personal delivery or by deposit in the United States mail, with

and maintain at all times during its use of park property, insurance in such
amounts and with such coverages as shall reasonably be required by the village
and shall name the village as an additional insured thereunder. The amounts and
type of insurance required shall be determined by the village administrator,
based upon the nature of the activity and the risk involved. The village
administrator shall prepare a uniform schedule of insurance guidelines for
particular types of activities. Applicant shall provide the village with a
certificate from its insurer evidencing such coverage prior to applicant's use
of park property (the village shall be named an additional insured). The
certificate shall also provide that the insurer shall give the village
reasonable advance notice of insurer's intent to cancel the insurance coverage
provided.
      7.   Conflict Of Planned Events: Permit applications shall not be
accepted by the authorized village official when it appears to the authorized
village official that there would be a conflict with any planned community
activity which would require use of the facility or when the prescribed
capacity would be exceeded.
      8.   Refusal Of Permit Application: No permit application shall be made
for any organization known to the authorized village official to discriminate
on the basis of race, creed, sex, skin color, national origin, provided,
however, that this provision shall not prevent a reservation on behalf of a
church league or other religious organization.
      9.   Discrimination Prohibited: No organization or individual shall be
refused the issuance of a permit because of any religious beliefs, race, creed,
sex, skin color or national origin of that individual or the constituent
members of the organization.

to cancel any approved permitted activity. In the event of such cancellation,
the reservation fees and security deposit shall be returned to the applicant.

of the fee shall be refunded but the security deposit shall be refunded.
      12.   Use Of Village Hall: It is the policy of the village that the
village hall shall not be used by any entity or group which is a for profit
organization, nor by clubs or private parties. Any use of the village hall
shall be subject to the prior approval of the village board.
   E.   Processing Of Application For Permits:
      1.   Order: Applications for permits shall be processed in order of
receipt; and the use of a particular park or part thereof shall be allocated
preference in order of receipt of fully executed applications.
      2.   Preliminary Approval: Applications for permits for activities or
events which require insurance, approval or permits from other governmental
entities, or compliance with other terms or conditions, will be reviewed and,
if the application otherwise conforms to all other requirements, a preliminary
approval will be issued. If, within fourteen (14) days of the issuance of the
preliminary approval, an insurance certificate evidencing the requisite
insurance is not filed with the village administrator, or the approval or
permit of other governmental entities has not been received, or the other terms
and conditions have not been met, the preliminary approval will expire, the
application for permit will be deemed denied and no written notice of denial
will be required; provided, however, for events or activities which involve the
use of special facilities, or activities described in this chapter, all terms
and conditions for issuance of the permit, including securing insurance, must
be completed prior to the event.
      3.   Written Denials: Except for applications for permits for which
preliminary approvals have been issued, applications for permits shall be
deemed approved subject to insurance requirements as provided in this chapter.
If no written denial is issued within fourteen (14) days of the date on which
the application is fully completed, executed and filed with the appropriate
officer or employee, as designated by the village administrator, the village
may extend the period of review for an additional fourteen (14) days by
issuance of a written notice of extension. If, prior to the expiration of the
extended review period, no written denial is issued, the application for permit
shall be deemed approved.
      4.   Notice Of Extended Review Or Denial Or Issuance Of Permit: Written
notice of denial or notice of extension shall be served on the applicant by
personal delivery, or by deposit in United States mail, with proper postage
prepaid, to the name and address set forth on the application for permit.
      5.   Contents Of Notice; Grounds For Denial: Notice of denial of an
application for permit shall clearly set forth the grounds upon which the
permit was denied and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal by the village
for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application for
permit or otherwise procure a permit. Where an application for permit has been
denied because a fully executed prior application for the same time and place
has been received, and a permit has been or will be granted to the prior
applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit
multiple occupancy of the particular area, the village shall propose an
alternate place, if available for the same time, or an alternate time, if
available for the same place. The village may deny an application for permit on
any of the following grounds:
         a.   The application for permit is not fully completed and executed.
         b.   The applicant has not timely tendered the application fee, user
fee, indemnification agreement, or security deposit.
         c.   The application for permit contains a material falsehood or
misrepresentation.

sued.
         e.   The applicant or the person on whose behalf the application for
permit was made has on prior occasions damaged park property and has not paid
in full for such damage, or has other outstanding and unpaid debts to the
village.
         f.   A fully executed prior application for permit for the same time
and place has been received, and a permit has been or will be granted to a
prior applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit
multiple occupancy of the particular park or part thereof.
         g.   The use or activity intended by the applicant would conflict with
previously planned programs organized and conducted by the village.
         h.   The proposed use or activity is prohibited by or inconsistent
with the recognized and accepted uses of the park or part thereof.
         i.   The use or activity intended by the applicant would present an
unreasonable danger to the health or safety of the applicant, or other users of
the park, of village employees or of the public.
         j.   The applicant has not complied or cannot comply with applicable
licensure requirements, ordinance or regulation of the village concerning the
sale or offering for sale of any goods or services.
         k.   The use or activity intended by the applicant is prohibited by
law, by this chapter or by another ordinance of the village.
         l.   The applicant has not secured the requisite insurance.
         m.   The applicant or the person on whose behalf the application for
permit was made has on prior occasions made material misrepresentations
regarding the nature or scope of the event or activity previously permitted or
has violated the terms of prior permits issued to the applicant.
      6.   Amendment Or Revision Of Applications: Any amendment or revision of
an application for permit shall, for purposes of determining the priority of
the application for permit, relate back to the original filing thereof, but the
time in which the village shall grant or deny the application for permit and
serve notice of such granting or denial shall be computed from the date of the
amendment or revision.
   F.   Procedures For Review; Waivers:
      1.   Review By Village Administrator:
         a.   Any applicant who is denied a permit or a permittee who is
assessed damages or a fine pursuant to this chapter may, within seven (7) days
of the service of notice of such determination, file a written appeal from such
determination with the village president.
         b.   The village president shall have seven (7) days from the date on
which the appeal was filed in which to serve upon the applicant a notice that
he has affirmed, modified or reversed the denial.
         c.   Such notice shall be deemed served upon the applicant or
permittee when it is personally delivered or when it is sent by United States
mail, with proper postage prepaid, to the name and address set forth on the
application for permit.
      2.   Form Of Appeals: Any appeals filed pursuant to this chapter shall
state succinctly the grounds upon which it is asserted that the denial should
be modified or reversed and shall be accompanied by copies of the application
for permit, the written notice of the determination of the supervisor and/or
the village administrator and any other papers material to the determination.
      3.   Waiver Of Requirements: Any requirements for or limitation upon a
permit or the requirement of a permit may be waived by the village
administrator if the activity is protected by the first amendment of the United
States constitution and the condition would be so financially burdensome that
it would preclude the applicant from using park property for the proposed
activity. Fees for equipment and services may not be waived pursuant to this
subsection. Application for a waiver shall be made on a form prescribed by the
village administrator.
   G.   Fines: The violation by a permittee of the terms of a permit or the
laws and regulations of the village shall subject the permittee to a civil fine
of up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Each day that a violation
continues shall be deemed a separate violation. Such fines may be assessed
against any security deposit held by the village on behalf of the permittee
pursuant to this chapter, or may be assessed in an amount in excess of any
security deposit held by the village. The village administrator shall give the
permittee prompt written notice of any fines to be assessed in excess of the
security deposit. Such notice shall be served on the permittee by personal
delivery, or by deposit in the United States mail, with proper postage prepaid
to the name and address set forth on the application for permit. (Ord. 2010-

8-1-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Building Permit Procedures:
      1.   Examination Of Application And Plans: To be made within a reasonable
time by or under the direction of the building inspector.
      2.   Action On Permit After Filing And Examination Of Application:
         a.   Permit shall be denied if plans or proposed work do not conform
to requirements of this title or other pertinent laws and ordinances. Denial
with reasons shall be given in writing upon request.
         b.   If proposed work conforms to requirements of this title and other
pertinent laws and ordinances, a permit shall be issued in writing to proceed
with work, returning one set of plans and specifications, endorsed by the
building inspector, to be kept on the job at all times.
         c.   Permit placard is to be furnished with permit or as the permit
itself, which is to remain conspicuously posted on premises during course of
work.
         d.   Permit lapses if a substantial start is not made in six (6)
months, if substantial progress is not made in a one year period and after two
(2) years, unless extended. Permits for demolition shall lapse ninety (90) days
after date of issuance.
         e.   A certificate of occupancy, which must be secured before a
building is permanently occupied, is to be issued by the building inspector
when an inspection following the completion of the work shows that all
construction is in compliance with this title and permit.
         f.   Temporary occupancy permit may be issued for a building or
portion thereof if it is found that the condition of the building and the
lighting, heating, water supply, sewage disposal and other sanitary facilities
available to the occupant provide a reasonable degree of safety. Evidence or
assurance of reasonably prompt completion shall be furnished. Permit may be
removed if work to complete is not diligently pursued. (Ord. 2007-737, 8-21-
2007, eff. 10-1-2007)
      3.   Damage To Public Roads; Road Bond; Site Bond: Contractors receiving
building permits shall be responsible for the damage caused to village roads
and other public property by the contractor's construction traffic, including
the contractor's subcontractors and material suppliers. Contractors are also
responsible to complete construction in accordance with the approved grading
plan. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the contractor applying for a
building permit shall deposit a road and site bond in the amount of three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00) in addition to all other building permit fees, to
stand as security for the repair of village roads or other public property for
damage caused by construction traffic and to ensure the site is improved in
accordance with the approved grading plan. No occupancy certificate shall be
issued unless and until the village engineer shall certify that all necessary
repairs have been made to the village roads or other public property. No final
occupancy certificate shall be issued unless and until the village engineer
shall certify that the site conforms to the approved grading plan. If the
contractor fails to promptly correct any damage to the road or public property
or fails to make the site conform to the approved grading plan, the village may
use the bond to have the corrective work done. Any remaining bond funds shall
be returned to the contractor after the engineer has certified that all
necessary repairs have been made to the village roads or other public property
and that the site conforms to the approved grading plan. This subsection,
however, shall not limit the liability of the contractor to repair village
roads or other public property or to make the site conform to the approved
grading plan pursuant to the terms of this section. All sites must conform
(including stabilization, driveway installation, etc.) to the approved grading
plan within one year from the date of issuance of any certificate of occupancy.
Any unreturned road and site bond remaining after one year from the date of
issuance of any certificate of occupancy shall be forfeited to the village and
credited to its general corporate fund account. (Ord. 2014-939, 12-2-2014)
   B.   Fees: The building permit fees shall be as established by resolution or

be installed facing downward to ensure that the perforations do not get clogged
with dirt and thereafter the drain tile fails to function properly. Conduits
shall be installed using the approved elbows, couplings, and fittings.
      4.   The drain tile shall be covered with a minimum of twelve inches
(12") of washed gravel, one-half inch (1/2") to three- fourths inch (3/4")
diameter, to a level three inches (3") or more above the top of the footing.
Foundation waterproofing shall not cover the required gravel. Install paper
cover over stone.
      5.   Window wells shall be provided with four inch (4") nonperforated
schedule 40 rigid plastic riser pipe, connected to the footing drain by means
of an approved rigid plastic eighth bend and tee, or be connected directly to a
storm sewer. The bell end of the riser shall terminate three inches (3") below
the bottom of the window frame and shall be provided with a plastic grate. The
riser pipe shall be securely fastened to the wall with two (2) straps, one at
the top of the riser pipe, and one near the bottom. Coarse stone shall be used
to fill the window well to a level adequate to cover the grate.
      6.   All window well drainpipes shall be plugged with manufactured plugs
or other approved methods prior to backfilling.

or to the next level of the scaffold to be used in conjunction with the
installation of the veneer, whichever is higher. Any masonry veneer wall which
is constructed without the preapplication of the veneer ties shall be deemed
defective and must be removed and reinstalled. (Ord. 2007-737, 8-21-2007, eff.
10-1-2007)
8-1-1-3: BUILDING INSPECTIONS:
After a building permit is issued and during the course of construction, the
building department makes periodic inspections to ensure compliance with the
applicable building code provisions. At the time of each such inspection, it
shall be the responsibility of the permittee to have an individual on site who
can communicate in the English language with village inspectors and is well
versed with the work which is the subject of the inspection to answer any
questions and provide any necessary information. If a permittee fails to abide
by this requirement, the property shall be red tagged and no further
construction shall occur until the permittee pays the reinspection fee and
obtains a reinspection in accordance with the requirements of this section.
(Ord. 2007-737, 8-21-2007, eff. 10-1-2007)
8-1-1-4: REQUIRED TOILET FACILITIES:
Unless or until workers will be accommodated by existing toilet facilities on a
construction site, a portable toilet shall be provided upon commencement of
construction activities and maintained until the completion of the construction
activities. The location of the portable toilet shall be set back a minimum of
ten feet (10') from all property lines. All portable toilets shall be emptied,
cleaned, and restocked as needed in compliance with all local, State and
Federal laws and regulations. For the purpose of this section, the term
"construction activities" shall include all new residential construction, all
new nonresidential construction and construction that takes place in
conjunction with the establishment of new residential subdivisions and planned
unit developments (applicable only when workers do not have access to toilet
facilities within the subdivision's/PUD's boundaries). In the event that a
toilet facility is not provided or accessible to workers in the case of
residential and nonresidential building additions, then in the opinion of the
Code official, a portable toilet facility must be provided on the construction
site. (Ord. 2007-737, 8-21-2007, eff. 10-1-2007)

8-5-5: Guarantee
8-5-1: PURPOSE:
There are certain areas within the village where property does not have access
through a public street constructed to village standards. It is the intention
of this chapter to establish a procedure whereby all properties shall be served
by a public street improved to current village standards. It is further the
intent to ensure that the cost of construction of public streets be borne by
the benefited property owners, not by the village. (Ord. 2004-660, 6-1-2004)
8-5-2: APPLICABILITY:
This chapter applies to all property within the village of Wadsworth which is
dependent for access upon and abuts a dedicated street which has not been
installed, which is gravel, or which otherwise does not meet current village
standards. This chapter does not apply to property which is located within a
subdivision or planned unit development where the village has a sufficient
guarantee such as a letter of credit or other acceptable surety to ensure that
the public improvements, including the public streets, shall be completed in
accordance with village standards within the time frame established by this
code. (Ord. 2004-660, 6-1-2004)
8-5-3: IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED:
   A.   Adjacent To Paved Street: If the street which provides access to the
applicant's parcel is paved but not paved along the frontage of the applicant's
parcel, as a condition of issuance of a building permit for a single-family
residence or other principal structure, the permit applicant shall improve to
current village standards the street adjacent to the front side of his parcel,
as determined by the front of the proposed house or other principal structure
to be built on the parcel, for the entire length of the frontage of his parcel
to the closest paved portion of the street to thereby create a continuous paved
street surface up to and along said parcel.
   B.   Adjacent To Gravel Street: If the street which provides access to the
applicant's parcel is gravel but not gravel along the frontage of the
applicant's parcel, as a condition of issuance of a building permit for a

shall improve to current village standards the street adjacent to the front
side of his parcel, as determined by the front of the proposed house or other
principal structure to be built on the parcel, for the entire length of the
frontage of his parcel to the closest gravel portion of the street to thereby
create a continuous gravel street surface up to and along said parcel.
   C.   Adjacent To Undeveloped Street: If the street which provides access to
the applicant's parcel has not been installed, or is not gravel, or is not
paved to village standards, and the street is not paved or gravel along the
frontage of the applicant's parcel, as a condition of issuance of a building
permit for a single-family residence or other principal structure, the permit
applicant shall improve to current village standards the street adjacent to the
front side of his parcel, as determined by the front of the proposed house or
other principal structure to be built on the parcel, for the entire length of
the frontage of his parcel to the closest street intersection to thereby create
a continuous gravel street surface up to and along said parcel. (Ord. 2004-660,
6-1-2004)
8-5-4: VILLAGE STANDARDS AND SUPERVISION:
Each street or portion thereof shall be constructed by the permit applicant to
village standards under the supervision of the village engineer and must be
approved by the village engineer prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the single-family residence or other principal structure. (Ord.
2004-660, 6-1-2004)
8-5-5: GUARANTEE:
At the time of building permit application, the applicant shall post a cash
bond or letter of credit in village approved format with the village equal to
one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the estimated cost of constructing
said street improvement, as determined by the village engineer, to guarantee
the completion of the improvement. Once the street is completed and accepted by
the village, the cash bond or letter of credit shall be returned to the
applicant. (Ord. 2004-660, 6-1-2004)

This Title shall be known, cited and referred to as the WADSWORTH FLOOD HAZARD
ORDINANCE. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-2: PURPOSE:
This Title is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this Village by
Illinois Compiled Statutes 1 , in order to accomplish the following purposes:
Mans' activities on flood plains are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare. It is the purpose of
these regulations to protect the public health, safety and general welfare by
restricting damageable potential elsewhere. More specifically, these flood
plain regulations have been established to:
   A.   Protect adjacent, upstream and downstream, private and public
landowners from increases in flood heights and velocities and resulting
increases in flood damages.
   B.   Minimize extraordinary direct and indirect costs to the Village and
other governmental units caused by developments within flood plains for streets
and other roadways, sewer and water, flood control works, flood relief and
emergency services.
   C.   Reduce public health and safety risks, prevent blighting and prevent
economic losses which detract from the general well-being and tax base of the
Village.
   D.   Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
   E.   Prevent water pollution, nuisances resulting from floating structures
and debris.
   F.   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the
Village.
   G.   Comply with the guidelines of the Regular National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP-24, CFR section 1909-1910) and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA 44, CFR section 59-60), as amended or revised. (Ord. 257, 7-11-
1988)

9-1-3: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this Chapter, the following words and terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Section:
BASE FLOOD: A flood magnitude with a one percent (1%) statistical chance of
being equalled or exceeded during any year; however, the occurrence of such an
event does not diminish the chance of its recurring again at any time.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally aboveground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home
or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one hundred eighty
(180) days.
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated volume of storage within the
base flood area used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when
artificial fill or structures are placed within the floodplain. The
uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off-site
floodwater elevations and flows.
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate, including:
   A.   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or any addition
to a building valued at more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
   B.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days;
   C.   Installing utilities, construction of roads or similar projects;
   D.   Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, bridges or culverts;
   E.   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating or other
nonagricultural alterations of the ground surface;
   F.   Storage of materials; or
   G.   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or velocity
of flood or surface waters.
Development does not include maintenance of existing buildings and facilities
such as reroofing; resurfacing roads or gardening, plowing and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading or construction of
levees.
DEVELOPMENT PERMIT: A separate permit which is required by the provisions of
this Title for any development activity (as defined above) that is proposed in
a special flood hazard area.
FEMA: The Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FIA: Federal Insurance Administration.
FLOOD: A temporary increase in normal water level (surface water elevation)
that results in water inundating areas adjacent or near to the usual channel or
lake or the inundation of other depressional areas.
FLOOD BASE ELEVATION, REGULATORY: The elevation of the water level having a one
percent (1%) probability of being equalled or exceed in any given year, also
known as the 100-year flood elevation. The flood base elevation at any location
is as defined in Section
9-1-6 of this Chapter.
FLOOD FRINGE, REGULATORY: That portion of the regulatory flood plain which is
immediately adjacent to the floodway. Although this area is prone to flooding,
it is not used to transport flood water flows. The highest elevation of the
regulatory flood fringe is coterminous to the highest elevation of the flood
plain.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM): An official map of the Village, issued or
approved by the Administrator of the Federal Insurance Administration, on which
the areas having special flood hazard have been drawn and designated as Zone A.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the FIA has
delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones
applicable to the community.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided in which the Federal
Insurance Administration has provided flood profiles, as well as the Flood
Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOOD PLAIN, REGULATORY: The continuous SFHA adjacent to a lake, stream or
stream bed, the elevation of which is greater than the normal water level
(surface water elevation) or pool elevation, but equal to or lower than the
flood base elevation. Natural depressions and storm water retention or
detention areas which periodically are inundated by storm water shall be
considered regulatory flood plain. Also, any land of higher elevation than the
flood base elevation, but having an area less than the minimum lot size
established for the zone in which it is located and surrounded by lands having
an elevation equal to or less than the flood base elevation shall be considered
flood plain. The flood plain comprises both the regulatory floodway and the
regulatory flood fringe.
FLOOD PROFILE GRAPHIC: A representation of the elevations of the water surface
of the 100-year flood along the water courses of the Village.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): An elevation of two feet (2') above the
regulatory flood base elevation which provides free-board protection against
ice jams, waves and debris in the event of periodic flooding.
FLOODWAY: That portion of the SFHA required to store and convey the base flood.
The floodway for the SFHAs of the Des Plaines River and Mill Creek shall be as
delineated on the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and dated August 4, 1980. The floodway for each of
the remaining SFHAs of the Village shall be according to the best data
available to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository.
FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT LINES: The lateral boundaries of the floodway which
separate it from the flood fringes.
FLOODWAY, REGULATORY: That portion of the regulatory flood plain immediately
adjacent to a lake, stream or stream bed which conveys base flood water flows
when channel capacities are exceeded without cumulatively increasing the water
surface elevation more than one-tenth of a foot (0.1'). Channel capacities are
exceeded when storm water results in a water elevation greater than the surface
water elevation.
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries),
stream, creek or brook.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Those lands within the jurisdiction of the
Village that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The SFHAs of the
Village are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Village prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated August 4,
1980. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Lake County that are within
the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into
the Village are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
prepared for Lake County by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated
February 4, 1981.
STRUCTURE: Anything constructed, erected or placed which required location in
or on the ground or is attached to anything in or on the ground.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
   A.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
   B.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
The term does not however, include either:
   C.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   D.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
ZONING ADMINISTRATOR: That official or employee of the Village charged with the
administration of the Wadsworth Zoning Ordinance, Title 10 of this Code, as
provided therein.
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS: The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the
Wadsworth Zoning Ordinance, Title 10 of this Code, and as appointed by the
Village President pursuant to the regulations therein. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-4: PROVISIONS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE PURPOSE:
All development proposals in the special flood hazard areas shall be reviewed
by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator's review is to ensure
that the use and development of and within a regulatory flood plain, comprising
both the regulatory floodway and the regulatory flood fringe, shall be allowed
in any zoning district subject to compliance with the following, as well as
with the other provisions of this Title and other applicable provisions of this
Code.
   A.   Regulatory Floodway: Nothing shall be constructed in a regulatory
floodway which results in increased flood heights or velocities, or causes
pollution, erosion, sedimentation, fire hazards, other hazards or nuisances.
Development or use of these low-lying lands is severely limited by these
regulations and is first subject to approval by the State of Illinois
Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, and the Village
Zoning Administrator. In no instance, however, shall development approval
negate the petitioner's responsibility to prevent the impediment of flood
water.
   B.   Regulatory Flood Fringe: The development or use of a flood fringe may
be allowed if in accordance with the provisions of these flood plain
regulations and other applicable codes and regulations. However, in no instance
shall a use be allowed which results in water pollution, increased threats of
fire or other nuisances, or threats to the public safety. Those structures, or
portions of structures, allowed in the flood fringe shall be required to be
floodproofed to a height of at least two feet (2') above the regulatory flood
base elevation, as it may be established, so as to prevent against the seepage
of water into said structures in the event of periodic flooding. Development or
use of the flood fringe must be authorized by both the State and the Village
Zoning Administrator. In some circumstances, other methods of flood plain
development which cause no significant increase in stage or velocity may be
allowed if supported by adequate engineering data as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-5: OTHER REGULATIONS:
Before starting any work regulated by this Title, an applicant shall comply
with the requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
the submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats,
improvement plans, building permits, zoning, inspections, appeals and similar
matters, along with those set forth in this Title and as may be required by
Federal and State laws, and the regulations of any department of the State of
Illinois (Illinois Division of Water Resources, Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency, U.S. Corps of Engineers, etc.). (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-6: SOURCE OF INFORMATION:
The regulatory flood base elevation, the regulatory flood plain, the regulatory
floodway and the regulatory flood fringe as defined by this Title shall be
delineated by the following maps, which are on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator. These maps are listed below according to priority of use. Where
information is not available on one map, then the succeeding map shall be used.
Where conflict occurs among the maps, the highest regulatory flood base
elevation, the widest regulatory flood fringe shall be used for regulatory
purposes. In the event that no separate map designation exists for regulatory
floodways, then the regulatory flood plain shall also mean regulatory floodway,
and regulatory floodway regulations shall apply to the regulatory flood plain.
The maps to be used are as follows:
   A.   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study for the Village of Wadsworth," dated August 4, 1980, with
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and Flood Boundary-Floodway Maps,
effective date February 4, 1981. For areas annexed to the Village since
publication of the Wadsworth Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the Lake County Flood
Insurance Rate Maps shall be used.
   B.   "Regulatory Floodplain Maps", Illinois Department of Transportation
(IDOT), Division of Water Resources in cooperation with the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Soil Conservation Service (SCS).
   C.   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map", United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD), Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   D.   "Hydrologic Investigations Atlas", United States Geological Survey
(USGS) in cooperation with the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission
(NIPC).
   E.   "Floodplain Topographic Maps", USDA, SCS. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-7: PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES:
No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially damaging
increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health and safety.
   A.   Within Floodways: Within the floodway identified on the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   Except as provided in subsection 2 below, no development shall be
allowed which acting in combination with existing or future similar works, will
cause any increase in the base flood elevation. The specific development
activities identified in subsection
9-1-7B2 shall be considered as meeting this requirement.
      2.   No increase in the base flood elevation may be permitted unless:
         a.   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the base flood elevation more than one foot (1') for the affected hydraulic
reach of the stream and will not increase flood damages or potential flood
damages;
         b.   A permit has been issued by the Illinois Department of
Transportation, Division of Water Resource, as required in subsection
 9-1-7B1; and
         c.   For all projects involving channel modification or fill
(including levees) the Village shall submit sufficient data to the Federal
Management Agency to revise the regulatory flood data.
   B.   Within All Other Riverine Special Flood Hazard Areas: Within all other
riverine SFHAs, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   In addition to the other requirements of this Title a development
permit for a site located in a floodway (or in a riverine SFHA where no
floodway has been identified) shall not be issued unless the applicant first
obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from
the Illinois Department of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, issued
pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
      2.   The following activities may be constructed subject to the issuance
of a development permit without the individual permit required in subsection 1,
above, in accordance with Statewide Permits issued by the Illinois Department
of Transportation, Division of Water Resources, provided the activities do not
involve placement of fill, change of grade or construction in the normal
channel. Such activities must still meet the other requirements of this Title:
         a.   The construction of underground utility lines not crossing a lake
or stream;
         b.   The construction of light poles, sign posts and similar
structures;
         c.   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields
(excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade;
         d.   The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures
such as playground equipment, pavilions and car ports;
         e.   The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding
seventy (70) square feet in size, nor ten feet (10') in any dimension (e.g.
animal shelters and tool sheds); and
         f.   The construction of additions to existing buildings the sum of
which do not increase the first floor area as it existed on January 12, 1981,
by more than twenty percent (20%) which are located on the upstream or
downstream side of the existing building, and which do not extend beyond the
sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of flood waters.
      3.   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the base flood elevation more than one foot (1') for the affected hydraulic
reach of the stream and will not increase flood damages or potential flood
damages.
   C.   Public Health Standards In All SFHAs:
      1.   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE unless such materials are
stored in a storage tank or floodproof building constructed according to the
requirements of subsection
 9-1-8B3.
      2.   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes or other aboveground openings
located below the FPE are watertight. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-8: PROTECTING BUILDINGS:
   A.   Below Flood Protection Elevation: In addition to the damage prevention
requirements of Section
 9-1-7, all buildings to be located in the special flood hazard area shall be
protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. These
building protection requirements apply to the following situations:
      1.   Construction or placement of new buildings valued at more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
      2.   Improvements made to an existing building that increases the first
floor area by more than twenty percent (20%) or the market value of the
building by more than fifty percent (50%). (See subsection
9-1-7B2 of this Chapter.)
      3.   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are valued
at or more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the building before damage
occurred.
   B.   Protection Methods: This building protection requirement may be met by
any one of the following methods:
      1.   Permanent Landfills: Permanent landfills may be permitted as means
of providing safe construction sites, provided:
         a.   The landfill, except in exceptional circumstances, be contiguous
with the boundary of the regulatory flood plain and shaped, in plan, so as not
to create adverse velocities or current patterns.
         b.   The surface of the landfill is at or above the regulatory flood
protection elevation.
         c.   The channelward face of the fill shall be protected against
erosion. If protected by vegetative cover, slopes shall be no steeper than
three horizontal to one vertical (3:1). Steeper slopes shall be protected by
riprap. A vertical bulkhead may be used if adequately founded and protected
against scour.
         d.   Fill shall be of such material and so compacted to provide
adequate support under saturated conditions and shall be otherwise suitable for

9-1-11A1 through A5 above. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-12: WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this Title is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasion or the flood height may be
increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This Title does not imply that areas outside the
regulatory flood plain or land uses permitted within such areas will be free
from flooding or flood damages. This Title shall not create liability on the
part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this Title or any decision lawfully made
thereunder. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-13: DISCLOSURE STATEMENT:

whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 257, 7-
11-1988)
9-1-15: INTERPRETATION:
In the interpretation and application of this Title, the provisions expressed
herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements and shall be liberally
construed in favor of the Village and shall not be deemed a limitation or
repeal of any other powers granted by State statutes. (Ord. 257, 7-11-1988)
9-1-16: PENALTY:
The Zoning Administrator may determine, upon due investigation, that a
violation of the minimum standards of this Title exist and after such owner
fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct his property, the Village may make
application to the Circuit Court for an injunction requiring conformance with
this Title or make such other order as the Court sees necessary to secure
compliance with this Title. Any person who violates this Title shall, upon
conviction thereof, be subject to penalty as provided in Section
1-4-1 of this Code. Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or
conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this
Title. Nothing herein shall prevent or remedy any violations. All costs

rules shall apply:
      1.   Where the district boundary is indicated as following or
approximately following the municipal boundary it shall be considered as
following that boundary.
      2.   Where district boundary lines are indicated as following streets,
alleys or similar rights of way, they shall be construed as following the
center lines thereof except that where such street lies along the Municipal
boundary, the district boundary shall be construed as following the Municipal
boundary.
      3.   Where district boundary lines are indicated as following or as
approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such
boundaries.
      4.   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the center
lines of streets, rivers or other flowing water courses shall be construed as
following the channel center line of such courses taken at mean low water, and
in the event of a natural change in the location of such streams, rivers or
other water courses the zone boundary shall be construed as moving with the
channel center line.
      5.   Where a lot (as distinguished from acreage) held in one ownership
and of record at the effective date of this Title is divided by a district
boundary line, the lot shall be construed as being in the district containing
the larger portion of the lot. If the Zoning Administrator cannot determine a
"larger" portion then the lot shall be construed as being in the more
restrictive district.
      6.   In unsubdivided property, unless otherwise indicated, the district
boundary line on the map accompanying and made a part of these regulations
shall be determined by the use of the scale contained on such maps.
   B.   Zoning Of Streets And Other Rights Of Way: All streets, alleys, public
ways and railroad rights of way, if not otherwise specifically designated,
shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting
upon such alleys, streets, public ways and railroad rights of way. Where the
center line of a street, alley, public way or railroad right of way serves as a
district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically
designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up
to such center line which are shown to be within scenic corridors shall be the
center lines of such Scenic Corridor Overlay Districts.
   C.   Inspection Of Official Copy: An official copy of the zoning map shall
be maintained in the Village Hall. The official copy shall have posted thereon
all changes in the map authorized by action of the Board of Trustees within one
week of the effective date of such action. Such map shall be available for
inspection during normal business hours at the Village Hall.
   D.   Changes: If by amendment to the this Title, any zone boundary as shown
on the Official Zoning Map or any other matter shown thereon, is changed by the
action of the Village Board, such change shall be promptly indicated on the
Official Zoning Map by the Village, together with the date of passage of the
amendment and sufficient written description to give a precise understanding of
the change. Every change shall be certified by the Clerk.
   E.   Publication: Once each year the zoning map, together with all changes
which have occurred since the effective date of the last publication. shall be
published as provided by the statute. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-3-6: NEW OR ANNEXED LAND:
Land which may be annexed to the Village hereafter and which is not shown on
the zoning maps shall be classified as AG Agricultural District until such time
as the Village Board designates a different classification in accordance with
the provisions of this Title or shall be classified as one of the other
districts established above in accordance with an annexation agreement with the
Village following a public hearing as provided by law. Annexed land lying
within an overlay district as shown on the Overlay District Map shall be

conditional use permit. More than one zoning lot may be combined to create a
multiple principal use activity, such as a mall, pursuant to a conditional use
permit, subject to the terms and conditions of the conditional use permit.
(Ord. 94-411, 11-1-1994)
10-3-8: BUILDINGS ON A ZONING LOT:
   A.   Residential District: In any residential district, every principal
building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a zoning
lot as herein defined and in no case shall there be more than one such building
on one zoning lot. Accessory buildings and uses are only permitted on the same
zoning lot as the principal building or use to which they are accessory.
   B.   Districts Other Than Residential: In any district other than a
residential district, more than one principal building devoted to the same
principal use may be permitted on a zoning lot subject to the regulations for
conditional uses and following the issuance of a conditional use permit. All
principal buildings or uses within the B, CR, OR or LI Districts shall be of
conventional construction, including a concrete slab floor and concrete
foundation. Temporary or semipermanent buildings such as pole barns are
prohibited. Accessory buildings and uses are only permitted on the same zoning
lot as the principal buildings or use to which they are accessory.
   C.   LI, OR, Or B Districts: In the LI, OR, or B Districts, multiple
principal uses in multiple principal use buildings, may be permitted by
conditional use permit on a zoning lot or combinations of zoning lots developed
in such a fashion to be conducive to multiple uses, such as a regional mall,
subject to the terms and conditions of the conditional use permit. (Ord. 94-
411, 11-1-1994)
10-3-9: DIVISION OF A ZONING LOT:
No zoning lot shall be divided or separated so that either the remaining lot or
any new lot or lots is a nonconforming lot or is a lot which as a result of

10-4-3: OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS:
   A.   Scenic Corridor Overlay District Regulations:
      1.   Intent: The scenic corridor overlay district is established to
preserve the scenic qualities of the village area in a period of transition
from a rural farming community to a low density, nonfarm residential community.
The vistas, open fields, wetlands and majestic stands of hardwood forest are
primary scenic resources which make Wadsworth a pleasant place to live. These
resources form the basis for both planning and zoning for low density, open
residential subdivisions. It is the intent of this section to preserve highly
visible portions of this scenic resource so that future development and future
residents can continue to enjoy the qualities which first attracted nonfarm
residents to the village and its environs.
      2.   Uses Permitted: Those uses permitted in the scenic corridor overlay
district shall be those uses as shown in section
10-4-4, table 1-A, "Uses Permitted In Overlay Districts", of this chapter,
subject to the regulations established herein. Any existing use is a permitted
use in the SCOD provided such use was a legally established use and permitted
use in the underlying district on the effective date hereof.
      3.   Prohibited Construction: Except as noted below all buildings and
structures including at grade construction shall be excluded from the scenic
corridors.
      4.   Exceptions: The following uses and accessory uses are permitted in
scenic corridors subject to the landscape standards established herein:
         a.   Buildings and structures including existing accessory structures
existing on the effective date hereof.
         b.   Agricultural uses provided that no barns or other structures
shall be constructed within such scenic corridor.
         c.   Open uses as provided in section
10-4-4, table 1-A, "Uses Permitted In Overlay Districts", of this chapter.
         d.   Entrances to subdivisions including identification signs subject
to the approval of the plan commission and village board of trustees.
         e.   Temporary real estate sales signs subject to the issuance of a
temporary use permit. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
         f.   Within the B (business) district, buildings, structures,
driveways, walks, lighting, parking lots, and signage; subject to applicable
setbacks, which are permitted within the B (business) district, are permitted
within the scenic corridor. (Ord. 2009-794, 11-3-2009)
      5.   Landscape Standards: All scenic corridor areas shall be landscaped
in accordance with the following standards:
         a.   All landscape improvements shall be undertaken only in accordance
with a landscape plan prepared by the owner, submitted to and approved by the
plan commission. In addition to the standards below, the plan shall conform to
the standards and requirements of Wadsworth landscape ordinance or other
suitable standards adopted by the village board.
            (1)   Landscape improvements shall be designed to blend in with the
existing landscape of the site and its immediate environs. Particular attention
shall be paid to natural areas and to farms, wetlands and other open areas.
Landscape features shall be designed to preserve and enhance such features.
            (2)   All screening shall be of a "naturalistic" design. (Ord. 91-
341, 4-2-1991)
            (3)   All built features such as signs, entrance details and
fencing shall reflect either a rural or farmlike character in keeping with the
intent of the scenic corridor. Further, any ground sign as permitted by section
10-5-8 of this title and located within twenty feet (20') of the scenic
corridor shall have the area surrounding such sign for a distance of twenty
feet (20') in all direction landscaped in a manner which blends in with the
landscaping of the adjacent scenic corridor area. The purpose of such
landscaping shall be to screen the sign supports and to improve the
compatibility of the sign with the scenic corridor by lessening to every degree
possible the visual impact of the sign. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991; amd. Ord. 94-
406, 9-20-1994)
         b.   Forested areas shall be protected and preserved. Any trees cut
during construction or in the establishment of a permitted use shall be
replaced as follows:
            (1)   Trees greater than ten inch (10") dbh shall be replaced with
two (2) trees at least three inch (3") caliper.
            (2)   Trees from six inch (6") to ten inch (10") dbh shall be
replaced with one and one-half (11/2) trees of at least three inch (3")
caliper.
            (3)   Trees smaller than six inch (6") dbh but larger than three
inch (3") dbh shall be replaced with one tree of at least three inch (3")
caliper.
            (4)   Replacement trees shall be of the same species as those
removed or of another suitable species indigenous to the immediate area.
Deciduous trees shall be replaced with deciduous trees and evergreen trees
shall be replaced with a suitable species of evergreens. All replacement trees
shall be guaranteed for one year.
         c.   Old fields may be left undisturbed or if disturbance is
unavoidable restored to their original (before development) condition.
         d.   Nurseries, orchards, tree farms, farm fields and pastures may be
continued in use for the same or similar farming or horticultural purposes.
         e.   The yards of existing homes and farmstead lying within scenic
corridors may be continued as yards and appropriately landscaped provided that
incompatible uses or landscape features are not introduced into the scenic
corridor area.
      6.   Alternative Design: The plan commission and village board may
approve an alternative design for the size, location and landscaping of a
scenic corridor as follows:
         a.   As part of a planned unit development provided that:
            (1)   No existing natural feature is destroyed.
            (2)   The amount of land area devoted to scenic corridor purposes
is not diminished.
         b.   In a business district, in accordance with standards to the
Wadsworth landscape ordinance or other suitable standard adopted by the village
board.
   B.   Historic Overlay District Regulations:
      1.   Intent: The historic overlay district is created to protect the
character and appearance of the older part of the community. New development
within the Wadsworth historic overlay district as shown on the overlay district
zoning map is required to conform to the appearance, scale and arrangement of
buildings presently found in the area. While existing residential uses are
permitted, it is expected that new development will be of a more commercial
character and that the Wadsworth historic overlay district will become a
community center for the larger village community.
      2.   Uses Permitted: The only uses permitted by right in the historic
overlay district are existing uses. In addition, any other use otherwise
permitted in the underlying zone and certain commercial uses listed in section
10-4-4, table 1-A, "Uses Permitted In Overlay Districts", of this chapter, are
permitted uses requiring site plan review. See subsection
10-5-4A of this title.
      3.   Existing Structure Regulations: Existing uses may be enlarged,
repaired, maintained or converted to a permitted alternative use provided that
the character and appearance of the existing structure is maintained.
      4.   New And Replacement Structure Regulations: The replacement of
existing structures and the construction of new structures shall be undertaken
only in accordance with a plan, including a site plan as provided in subsection
10-5-4A of this title, submitted to and approved by the village board. In
addition to the standards below such plan shall conform to the Wadsworth
appearance ordinance and Wadsworth landscape ordinance or other suitable
standards adopted by the village board.
         a.   All structures herein, shall be designed to blend in with
existing structures and shall have an appearance which corresponds to existing
structures in the historic overlay district or to other structures typifying
structures built at that time. Exterior materials used, architectural form
(roof pitch, number of stories, fenestration and architectural detailing) and
arrangement shall provide the basis for achieving a suitable correspondence.
         b.   The scale of structures shall also conform to the existing
historic overlay district. No structure which replaces an existing structure
shall have a floor area exceeding that of the original structure by a factor of
more than two (2). No new structure shall exceed the size of the largest
structure in the historic overlay district by a factor of more than half (1.5).
      5.   Lot, Yard And Bulk Regulations: The following standards shall apply
to existing lots and parcels in the Wadsworth historic overlay district.
         a.   No lot shall be regarded as a nonconforming lot and no use shall
be regarded as a nonconforming use in the historic overlay district solely
because of lot size regulations provided that additional lot area or other
adjoining area may be required to correct deficiencies in septic systems or to
provide additional parking in conjunction with the change of an existing use to
new use.
         b.   Front yard setback lines shall be either the front setback line
of the existing building or the setback line of the adjoining building with the
least setback. In no case shall a new building be permitted to set back farther
than the buildings on either side of the lot on which it is located.
         c.   All lots shall conform to the existing side and rear lot setback
requirements of the district in which they are located.
         d.   All lots shall conform to the height regulations of the district
in which they are located.
         e.   Within the historic overlay district the floor area ratio or lot
coverage regulations shall not be applicable.
         f.   Within the historic overlay district the site capacity
regulations shall not be applicable.
         g.   The applicable requirements of the Lake County health department
and Lake County department of transportation shall apply. (Ord. 341, 4-2-1991)
      6.   Historic Overlay District Boundaries: The boundaries of the historic
overlay district shall be as set forth on the historic overlay district map
dated March 1, 1993, section
10-4-4, exhibit A, of this chapter, and such subsequent amendments as the
village board may from time to time approve. (Ord. 405, 9-20-1994)

   D.   Wastewater Management Overlay District Regulations:
      1.   Intent: The wastewater management review district is established to
promote office, research corporate park and related commercial uses through the
private development of a unified wastewater treatment system in the area
adjoining the Illinois Tollway in the vicinity of Route 173. Based on the
establishment of such facilities the district regulations provide for more
intensive use of land. It is not the intent of this overlay district to
establish residential neighborhood of greater density or intensity of use than
would otherwise be permitted by the underlying district regulations.
      2.   Uses Permitted: The uses permitted in the wastewater management
overlay district are those uses as shown in section
10-4-4, table 1-A, "Uses Permitted In Overlay Districts", of this chapter,
subject to the following regulations.
      3.   Lot, Yard And Bulk Regulations:
         a.   For uses served by conventional septic disposal systems the lot,
yard and bulk regulations shall be the same as shown for the district in which
the use is located as shown in section
10-4-4, table 2, "Lot Size, Yard And Bulk Regulations", of this chapter.
         b.   For uses served by an approved alternative wastewater treatment
system the lot, yard and bulk regulations shown in section
10-4-4, table 2-A, "Lot Size, Yard And Bulk Regulations In The Wastewater
Management Overlay District", of this chapter shall apply.
      4.   Alternative Wastewater Treatment Systems: Alternative technologies
including, but not limited to, spray irrigation systems, mechanical systems,
zero discharge systems or combinations of such systems may be approved. Such
system shall first be approved by the appropriate agency of the state of
Illinois, the Lake County health department or the Lake County public works
department in conformance with jurisdiction of each.
      5.   Design Requirement: In addition to meeting the technical
requirements of the reviewing agencies above, alternative systems in the
wastewater management overlay district shall meet the following requirements:
         a.   Individual systems serving single uses shall be capable of being
integrated into a districtwide system or shall be capable of expansion to serve
the needs of the district or a larger service area within the district.
         b.   The design of the system shall include plans or programs for
operation and management of the facility consistent with the overall objective
of establishing a unified system.
         c.   Alternative wastewater treatment systems designed to serve more
than a single user shall only be approved in conjunction with a potable water
system designed to serve the same area.
         d.   In addition to the approvals required above, an alternative
system shall also be approved by the village engineer.
      6.   Service Area: The village, at its discretion, may require the
establishment of a separate utility service area to provide for the
establishment, operation and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment
facilities within the wastewater management overlay district.
   E.   Interpretation Of Table: The uses permitted in the overlay district
portion of zones are shown in section

10-5-1: INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish regulations and standards for
the installation and operation of industrial uses, based upon consideration of
the objectionable characteristics of such uses and the zones in which they are
permitted.
Further, this is intended to prescribe procedures and methods of measurement of
industrial characteristics subject to such standards.
Any use permitted in the OR, LI zones or any overlay district, whether such use
is permitted as a principal use or as an accessory use, shall be subject to
these standards:
   A.   Permit Procedure: Before the zoning officer issues a building permit
for a use in any OR or LI zone, the applicant shall furnish the zoning officer
sufficient information to enable the zoning officer to assure himself that all
performance can and will be complied with at all times. The zoning officer, in
order to determine whether or not the applicant will meet such standards, may
require the applicant to submit the following information:
      1.   A plot plan showing the location of all present and proposed
structures, drives, parking lots, waste disposal areas, bulk storage areas,
streets, streams or other significant features on or within two hundred feet
(200') of the proposed site.
      2.   A description of the activity to be conducted regarding waste
products, external effects or other conditions which are regulated herein;
provided, however, that the applicant shall not be required to reveal any trade
secrets or sufficient detail with regard to a process which would cause any
secret process or manufacturing procedure for a closely guarded proprietary
compound or product to become public knowledge and be available to competitors.
      3.   The type and location of abatement devices to control, or recording
instruments to measure, conformance with required standards, not including
devices and instruments which are inherent in the manufacturing process.
      4.   Such other data and certification as may reasonably be required by
the zoning officer to reach a determination.
All information and evidence submitted in applications to indicate conformity
to performance standards shall constitute a certification and an agreement on
the part of the applicant that the proposed use can and will conform to such
standards at all times.
   B.   Performance Standards: In the OR and LI zones, the following
regulations shall apply:
      1.   Noise:
         a.   Permitted Noise Levels: At no point on or beyond the boundary of
any lot which abuts a lot in the same zone shall the sound pressure level
resulting from any use or activity, whether open or enclosed, exceed the
maximum permitted decibel levels for the designated octave band as set forth in
table 3, section
10-5-14 of this chapter.
The sound pressure level resulting from any use or activity which abuts any
other zone shall not exceed the maximum permitted level for the octave band as
provided in Table 3, Section
10-5-14 of this Chapter.
         b.   Method Of Measurement: Sound levels shall be measured with a
sound level meter and associated octave band filter manufactured according to
standards prescribed by the American Standards Association. Measurements shall
be made using the flat network and "slow" meter response of the sound level
meter. Impulsive type noises shall be subject to the performance standards if
those noises are capable of being accurately measured with such equipment.
Noises capable of being so measured, for the purpose of this Title, shall be
those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level
meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two (2) decibels. Noises
capable of being so measured, but objectionable because of intermittence, beat,
frequency or shrillness shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to
adjacent uses.
         c.   Exception: Nothing in this Chapter shall apply to noises not
directly under the control of the property user; noises resulting from the
construction and maintenance of buildings and facilities including site
preparation; noises of safety signals or warning devices and noises of railroad
or trucking equipment.
      2.   Vibration: Steady-state vibrations, for the purpose of this Title,
are vibrations which are continuous or vibrations in discrete pulses more
frequent than one hundred (100) per minute. Discrete pulses which do not exceed
one hundred (100) impulses per minute shall not cause displacement in excess of
twice the values established in Table 4, Section
10-5-14 of this Chapter. Impact vibrations shall mean vibrations occurring in
discrete pulses separated by an interval of at least one minute and numbering
no more than eight (8) per twenty four (24) hour period.
         a.   Permitted Vibration Displacements: At no point on or beyond the
boundary of any lot shall the ground-transmitted steady-state or impact
vibration caused by any use or activity (except those not directly under the
control of the property uses) exceed the limits as established in Tables 4 and
5, Section
10-5-14 of this Chapter, for the OR and LI Zones.
         b.   Method Of Measurement: For the purpose of measuring vibrations, a
three (3) component measuring system shall be used. A three (3) component
measuring system denotes instrumentation which can measure earthborn vibrations
in three (3) directions, each of which occurs at right angles to the other two
(2).
      3.   Smoke And Particulate Matter: The emission, from all sources within
any lot, or particulate matter containing more than five percent (5%) by weight
of particles having a particle diameter larger than forty four (44) microns is
prohibited. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards and roads within the boundaries of any lot
shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling or other
acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such sources in excess of
weight limitations specified herein is prohibited. The emission of smoke or
particulate matter of a density equal to, or greater than No. 2 on the
Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times except as otherwise provided
herein.
         a.   Smoke Emission: In the OR and LI Zones, the emission of more than
twelve (12) smoke units per stack in any one hour period is prohibited;
however, once during any six (6) hour period each stack shall be permitted up
to twelve (12) additional units in a fifteen (15) minute period for soot
blowing and fire cleaning. Only during such fifteen (15) minute periods shall
smoke of a density equal to, but not exceeding, Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted
and then only for fire cleaning and for not more than four (4) minutes per
period.
         b.   Particulate Matter Emission: The rate of emission of particulate
matter from all sources within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed the
rate established in Table 6, Section
10-5-14 of this Chapter.
         c.   Methods Of Measurement:
            (1)   Smoke: For the purpose of grading the density of emission of
smoke, the Ringelmann Chart, published and used by the United States Bureau of
Mines, shall be employed. For the purpose of determining smoke units, the
Ringelmann density reading shall be made at least every minute during the
period of observation. Each reading (Ringelmann number) shall be multiplied by
the time in minutes for which it is observed and the products added together to
determine the total number of smoke units observed during the total period of
observation.
            (2)   Particulate Matter: The total net rate of emission of
particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be determined as
follows:
Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of emission
and divide by the number of acres of lot areas, thereby obtaining the hourly
rate of emission in pounds per acre. Add together the individual rates of
emission as derived above to obtain the total rate of emission from all sources
within the boundaries of the lot. It is this total that shall not exceed the
rate established in table 6, section
10-5-14 of this chapter.
      4.   Odors: No continuous, frequent or repetitive emission of odors or
odor causing substances which would be offensive beyond any property lines of
any industrial use will be permitted. An odor emitted no more than fifteen (15)
minutes in any one day shall not be deemed as continuous, frequent or
repetitive within the meaning of these regulations. The existence of an odor
shall be presumed when analysis by a competent technician demonstrates that a
discernable odor is being emitted. Any process which may involve the creation
or emission of any odors shall be provided with a primary and a secondary
safeguard system so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard
system fails. The rules and regulations of the Illinois air pollution control
board shall be complied with.
      5.   Radiation Hazards: The handling of radioactive materials, the
discharge of such materials into air and water and the disposal of radioactive
wastes shall be in conformance with:
         a.   The applicable regulations of the atomic energy commission; and
         b.   The applicable regulations of any instrumentality of the state.
      6.   Fire And Explosive Hazards:
         a.   The provisions of 225 Illinois Compiled Statutes 210/1001 et
seq., shall be complied with and no explosives shall be stored, used or
manufactured without first submitting to the zoning officer a certificate of
compliance from the Illinois department of mines and minerals.
         b.   No gasoline or other inflammables or explosives shall be stored
unless the location, plans and construction conform to the laws and regulations
of the state of Illinois fire marshal's office.
      7.   Glare And Heat: Every use and activity shall be so operated that it
does not emit heat or heated air beyond the boundary of the lot on which it is
located. No direct or sky reflected flare shall emanate from any use or
activity so as to be visible at any point on or beyond the boundary of the lot
on which such use or activity is located. This restriction shall not apply to
signs otherwise permitted by the provisions of this title or other applicable
ordinances, nor to activities of a temporary or of an emergency nature. Night
lighting necessary for safety and the protection of property is excluded from
this provision.
      8.   Electromagnetic Interference: There shall be no electromagnetic
interferences that adversely affect the operation of any equipment other than
that belonging to the creator of such interference or that does not conform to
the regulations of the federal communications commissions.
   C.   Enforcement: The zoning officer shall enforce the provisions of this
chapter. Upon confirmation of a violation, enforcement and penalty provisions
of section
10-7-5 of this title shall prevail. In addition, the village may require the
installation, maintenance and operation by the offending industry of continuous
measuring or recording instruments to demonstrate the operation and to ensure
continuous compliance with the prescribed standards. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-5-1-1: LI-1 AND LI-2 DISTRICTS:
All of the provisions of this chapter which apply to the LI district shall
apply in the same manner to the LI-1 and LI-2 districts. (Ord. 2004-651, 2-17-
2004)
10-5-2: FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS:
Title 9 of this code shall be complied with, in addition to the requirements of
this title. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-5-3: SITE CAPACITY REGULATIONS:
   A.   Purpose: In addition to the general purposes of this title, the
regulations contained herein are established for the following purposes:
      1.   To establish reasonable rules and regulations governing the
intensity of land development in relation to the natural capabilities of the
environment to sustain disturbance without significant disruption to the
natural functions and ecological processes provided by the sensitive natural
resources and features.
      2.   To prohibit uses and structures which are incompatible with the
character of land and the natural resources and features thereon.
      3.   To protect persons and property from hazards resulting from the
inappropriate development of land containing sensitive, unstable or hazardous
natural resources or features.
      4.   To promote the orderly development of the Village in accordance with
the Official Plan.
   B.   Applicability: This regulation shall apply in the following instances:
      1.   Any lot or parcel for which a building permit is requested where
such lot contains any of the natural resources or features identified herein
provided that any lot of forty thousand (40,000) square feet which legally
exists as of the date of adoption of the Ordinance codified in this Title,
including any legal nonconforming lot which is held in single ownership as of
the date of adoption of the Ordinance codified in this Title shall not be
denied a building permit solely because of any failure to conform to the
standards of this Section. Further, no such existing lot which is not a
nonconforming lot shall be designated a nonconforming lot solely because of any
failure to conform to the standards of this Section.
      2.   The subdivision of any parcel of land which is subject to the
regulations of Title 11 of this Code into two (2) or more lots.
      3.   The construction or development of any planned unit development
which contains a total of ten (10) or more dwelling units.
      4.   The site capacity calculations required by subsection C below shall
be waived by the Plan Commission for properties of less than ten (10) acres
when the Commission determines that no natural resources or natural features
identified by this regulation are present on such properties.
   C.   Site Capacity And Environmental Performance Standards:
      1.   In addition to all lot area, yard and bulk regulations established
by Section
10-4-2 of this Title or by any conditional use, variation or annexation
agreement, all developments subject to this regulation shall comply with those
standards specified in the following table governing the minimum open space
ratio, maximum density factor, maximum gross density, maximum impervious
surface ratio and maximum floor area ratio.
      2.   Site capacity for any proposed development is equal to the net
buildable area of the site multiplied by the density factor, in the case of
residential uses; or by the floor area ratio or impervious surface ratio,
whichever is more restrictive, in the case of nonresidential uses. The site
capacity calculation provides the mechanism for subtracting from the base site
area all portions of a site inappropriate for development.
   D.   Site Capacity Calculation: The following calculations shall be
submitted for all development to which this regulation applies, prior to the
approval of any preliminary or final plat of subdivision, the commencement of
any site development or the issuance of any building permit:
      1.   Base Site Area (All Land Uses): The base site area shall be
determined by the following calculations.
   a. Gross site area as determined by actual on- site survey.                acres
   b. Subtract land constituting road and land within ultimate rights of way o-
existing roads, rights of way of utilities and easements                         acres
of access.
   c. Subtract land which is not contiguous:
    (1) A separate parcel which does not abut, adjoin or share common        -
  boundaries with the rest of the development.                                   acres
     (2) Land which is cut off from the main parcel by a road, railroad,      -
 existing land uses or major stream, such that common use is hindered or that   acres
  the land is unavailable for building purposes.
   d. Subtract land which, in previously approved subdivision encompassing the-
same land, as part or all of the subject parcel, was reserved for resource       acres
reasons, (e.g., flooding or for recreation.)
   e. Subtract land used or proposed for nonresidential uses whenever both
nonresidential and residential uses are proposed. (In case of the site capacity  -
calculation for the proposed nonresidential use, subtract the land proposed for  acres
residential use.)
   f. Equals Base Site Area.                                                  =
                                                                                 acres
 
      2.   Resource Protection Land (All Land Uses): All land area consisting
of the natural resources or natural features listed below shall be measured.
The total acreage of each resource shall be multiplied by its respective open
space ratio to determine the amount of resource protection land or area
required to be kept in open space in order to protect the resource or feature.
In those areas of a site which consists of two (2) or more natural resources or
features, only that resource or feature which is subject to the highest open
space ratio shall be calculated. This sum total of all resource protection land
on the site equals the total resource protection land.

the establishment of a maintenance easement.
 
      3.   Recreational Land (Residential Subdivision And Planned Development
Uses Only): This calculation is required for all residential subdivisions or
planned unit developments with the exception of subdivisions which would be
required to provide less than one-fourth (1/4) acre by the following
calculation. This calculation does not apply to individual residential lots or
to nonresidential uses. Total recreation land required for residential uses is
as follows:
Take      Base site area
Subtract  Total acres of land in resource                  -
Equals    Total unrestricted land                          =
Multiply  Total unrestricted land by recreation multiplier x
          for the appropriate district.

          remaining to be provided
 
      4.   Site Capacity (Residential): Individual site capacity is determined
by multiplying the density factor by the net buildable site area to obtain the
maximum number of dwelling units permitted. The calculations are as follows:
Take     Total resource protection land              Ac.
Add      Total recreation land remaining             +Ac.
Equals   Total open space                            =Ac.
Take     Base site area                              Ac.
Multiply Open space ratio                            xAc.
Equals   Minimum required open space                 =Ac.
Take     Base site area                              Ac.
Subtract Total open space or minimum required        -Ac.

        (do not round off: use lowest whole number)  
         
Use maximum dwelling units or number of dwelling units, whichever is less.
 
      5.   Site Capacity (Nonresidential): Individual site capacity is
calculated as follows. Both maximum impervious surface area and maximum floor
area must be calculated.
Take        Base site area             Ac.
Subtract    Resource protection land   -Ac.
Equals      Buildable land             =Ac.

   E.   Environmental Protection Standards:
      1.   General Standards:
         a.   Prior to the commencement of any development subject to this
Regulation, plans and other information reasonable necessary to identify and
verify the existence of any of the environmental features noted below shall be
submitted. All plans for development shall account for such features and shall
fully comply with the environmental protection standards applicable to each
feature. Site alterations, regrading, filling and clearing of vegetation after
the adoption of this Regulation but prior to the submission and approval of
such plans shall be a violation of this Title. All references to "open space"
shall mean the term as it is defined herein.
         b.   In any proposed development wherein resources and open spaces are
required to be protected and preserved, the developer shall furnish the Village
a preliminary resource protection plan at the time of submission of the
preliminary development plan or tentative plat. This plan shall be drawn to the
same scale as the preliminary development plan, tentative plat or site plan and
shall include the following:
            (1)   Natural conditions of the site including topography,
drainageways, watershed divides and all resources required to be protected.
            (2)   Proposed site improvements including the location, size
(footprint or building pad) of buildings, septic system or alternative systems,
drainage and detention improvements.
            (3)   All proposals, features or structures intended to protect and
preserve resources both during construction and in the completed project
including but not limited to easements, dedications grading, structures,
fences, reforestation and compensatory features.
         c.   The final plat shall show any approved easements, dedications or
other appropriate means used to implement the resource protection plan.
      2.   Flood Plain:
         a.   Permanent Open Space: All flood plains shall be permanent open
space.
         b.   Permitted Uses: Only those uses permitted by Title 9 of this
Code.
      3.   Wetlands:
         a.   Permanent Open Space: All such areas shall remain as permanent
open space. Wetlands may be deepened or enlarged but wetlands shall not be
filled except in accordance with regulations of Title 9 of this Code.
         b.   Permitted Uses: Only those uses which are permitted by right in
flood plains shall be permitted by right in wetlands. These uses are specified
in Title 9 of this Code.
All other structures and uses permitted by the underlying zoning may be
permitted in a wetland pursuant to the issuance of a variance. The standards
and procedures for such variance shall be the same as those for flood plain
uses established by Title 9 of this Code.
      4.   Steep Slopes: In areas of steep slopes, the following standards
shall apply:
         a.   Fifteen To Thirty Percent Slope: At least fifty percent (50%) of
such areas shall remain as permanent open space. No more than thirty percent
(30%) of such areas shall be developed and/or regraded or stripped of
vegetation, with the exception that no more than twenty percent (20%) of such
areas may be disturbed in the case of Rodman Soils.
         b.   More Than Thirty Percent Slope: At least sixty percent (60%) of
such areas shall remain as permanent open space. No more than fifteen percent
(15%) of such areas shall be developed and/or regraded or stripped of
vegetation, except that no more than five percent (5%) of such areas may be
disturbed in the case of Rodman Soils.
      5.   Forest:
         a.   In forests containing a combination of young woodlands and mature
woodlands, the total area that may be cleared shall be determined by the
calculations in subsection D2 Resource Protection Land. The maximum area which
may be cleared may be determined by calculating the weighted average open space
ratio applicable to the forest as a whole; that is, forest multiplied by the
area contained within that type of forest and divided by the entire area of
forest on the site.
Where the forest stands are of a single category, the following standards
apply: No more than thirty percent (30%) of any mature woodland may be cleared
or developed. The remaining seventy percent (70%) shall be maintained as
permanent open space. No more than sixty percent (60%) of any young woodland
shall be cleared or developed. The remaining forty percent (40%) shall be
maintained as permanent open space or may be included as part of an enlarged
lot or lots in accordance with subsection F of this Section. A tree survey may
be submitted but is not required in order to delineate woodland areas. In
addition:
            (1)   The developer may designate a new forest area on a part of
the site not forested. A reforestation plan shall be submitted showing the
location, size and type of all plant materials to be installed. Such materials
shall be of a suitable type and compatible with the existing or native
vegetation of the site.
            (2)   The new forest area shall consist of one and two-tenths (1.2)
times the surface acreage of the forest area disturbed by the development.
            (3)   The following amount of plant materials shall be provided per
each acre of new forest to be established. Fractional requirements resulting
from fraction of acres to be established shall conform to lists of approved
plant materials by soil types provided by the Director of Planning. Either of
the following two (2) options may be chosen:
         Plant Materials        Minimum Size Of
         Required Per Acre      Plant Materials
         
           5 canopy trees   4 inch caliper
           10 canopy trees  21/2 inch caliper
Option 1    50 canopy trees  5 foot height
           20 understory tre3 foot height
           100 shrubs       3 foot height
         
           5 canopy trees   4 inch caliper
Option 2    600 canopy trees 3 foot height
           30 understory tre2 foot height
           130 shrubs       2 foot height
 
      6.   Lakes And Ponds: All such areas shall be permanent open space. No
development or diverting of these bodies of water shall be permitted except to
provide required roads. Filling shall be permitted only in conjunction with
deepening the land and is permitted only if surface area and flood retention
capabilities remain unchanged or are enlarged. Notwithstanding the regulations
herein, where the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers wetland regulations impose a
higher standard or greater restriction, such regulations shall be met.
      7.   Lake Shorelines: The shorelines of lakes, consisting of the area
within one hundred feet (100') from the shorelines, shall contain no more than
fifteen percent (15%) impervious surfaces. At least seventy five percent (75%)
of all such areas shall be permanent open space.
      8.   Pond Shorelines: The shorelines of ponds consisting of the area
within fifty feet (50') from the shoreline shall contain no more than fifteen
percent (15%) impervious surfaces. At least seventy five percent (75%) of all
such areas be permanent open space.
      9.   Drainageways:
         a.   Permitted Uses: No portion of a natural drainageway shall be
developed. An existing natural drainageway may be improved and up to fifty
percent (50%) of the area of such drainageway may be used for other permitted
open uses such as passive recreation, storm water detention or circulation
provided that the remaining area shall be improved only as follows:
            (1)   The time of concentration of stormwater flows remains
unchanged or is lengthened;
            (2)   Stormwater and ground water storage capacity are unchanged or
increased;
            (3)   Natural vegetation is installed;
            (4)   The resultant new drainageway has less velocity than
preexisted or reduces stream-bank erosion.
         b.   For those developments which do rely on underground absorption
fields, the extent of the drainageway shall be determined either by its order
of magnitude or the limits of the seasonably saturated soils presented in the
drainageway, whichever area is greater. For the purpose of this determination,
for following soil types identified by the Soil Survey shall be considered
seasonally saturated drainageway soils.
 
Houghton muck            (103)
Sawmill silty clay loam  (107)
Pella silty clay loam    (153)
Ashkum silty clay loam   (232)
Peotone silty clay loam  (330)
Granby loamy fine sand   (513)
 
         c.   Obstructions: In no event shall filling or grading be permitted
which would result in surface water flows being interrupted, causing flooding
or inundation of upstream or downstream property owners. The Zoning Officer may
require installation of storm sewers, ditches or other devices to ensure that
these provisions are met.
   F.   Open Space:
      1.   General Requirements: The location and total areas of all open space
required by this Title shall be clearly indicated on the plans submitted
pursuant to subsection D of this Section. Open space shall be designated in one
or more of the following ways:
         a.   Natural Areas: Natural areas of undisturbed vegetation or areas
replanted with vegetation after construction. Woodlands, woodland swamps
(hydric soils), prairies, wetlands (hydric prairies) and savannah are specific
types of natural areas.
         b.   Recreational Areas: Recreational areas designated for specific,
active recreational uses, such as tot lots, tennis courts, swimming pools,
ballfields and similar uses.
         c.   Greenway Acres: Greenway acres are linear green belts linking
residential areas with open space areas. These greenways may contain bicycle
paths, foot paths and bridle paths. Connecting residential and recreational
areas with greenways is encouraged.
         d.   Buffers: Buffers are generally landscaped and serve to separate
residential uses from adverse uses or highly traversed roadways.
         e.   Agricultural Areas: Agricultural areas or garden plots are areas
reserved for agriculture including croplands, pastures and garden plots.
Land designated as open space shall be maintained as open space for the use
designated and may not be separately subdivided or developed except as provided
herein. Land which is required by this Title to remain as open space may be
used for the recreational, agricultural, resource protection, amenity and other
purposes specified in this Chapter and is designated on the plans. Recreation
open space areas shall be generally accessible to all residents of a
development. Access between agricultural areas and nonagricultural areas may be
restricted. Access to land remaining in open space for the purpose of
protecting natural resources may also be restricted in order to ensure such
protection. Except as otherwise provided in this Title, no area occupied
nonrecreational, roads, road rights of way or parking areas shall be counted as
designated open space.
      2.   Preservation Of Open Space: Open space areas shall be designed so
their use and enjoyment as open space are not obstructed. Open space areas
shall be maintained as specified below. The form of open space ownership shall
be designated on the plans. Open space areas may be owned and preserved by any
of the following mechanisms or combinations hereof:
         a.   Dedication of open space to the Village, an appropriate public
agency or not-for-profit organization, approved by the Village Board, which is
willing to accept the dedications.
         b.   Common ownership of the open space by a homeowners' or property
owners' association which assumes full responsibility for its maintenance and
which shall prevent development and/or subsequent subdivision of the open space
land for other than open space purposes. In the event that open space is to be
owned and maintained by such an association, documents establishing the
association, detailing its obligations and otherwise providing for the
maintenance and preservation of open space areas shall be prepared and
submitted with the plans. Covenants shall provide for the mandatory inclusion
of all property owners for the purpose of being responsible for the continual
maintenance of the open space and recreational areas.
         c.   Deed restricted private ownership which shall ensure that no
development and/or subsequent subdivision of the open space land for other than
open space uses shall be permitted. The maintenance responsibility of all open
space areas shall be specified and provision shall be made for guaranteeing
this responsibility.
         d.   Conservation rights conveyed in accordance with and subject to
the provisions and requirements contained in "An Act Relating Conservation
Rights in Real Property 1 ", provided the items of such conveyance have been
reviewed and approved by the Village Board.
In the event that any property owners' association, private party or other
agency charged with the responsibility of maintaining open space fails to
maintain the open space, the Village or its designated agent may proceed to
correct the failure of maintenance, following reasonable notice and demand that
the deficiency of maintenance be corrected; however, no prior notice is
required if the failure to so maintain has created a clear and imminent hazard
to the health, safety or welfare of the residents or the general public. The
cost of such maintenance to the Village shall be charged against that person,
association or agency having the responsibility for maintenance of the open
space.
      3.   Maintenance Of Open Space: Maintenance of open space shall be as
follows:

10-5-6: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Purpose: The regulations contained in this section are established to
encourage creative and imaginative design of coordinated land uses and to
provide relief from the subdivision and zoning district requirements which are
designed for conventional developments, but which may inhibit innovation and
cause undue hardship with regard to the use of parcels which present technical
development problems. Planned unit developments are intended to allow
substantial flexibility in planning and designing a project. This flexibility
often occurs in the form of relief from compliance with conventional zoning and
subdivision requirements. Ideally, this flexibility results in a development
that is better planned, that contains more amenities, and ultimately a
development that is more desirable to live in than one produced in accordance
with typical zoning ordinance and subdivision controls. These regulations are
established to provide a safe and desirable living environment for residential
areas characterized by a unified building and site development program, to
preserve natural features of the site and to provide adequate open space for
recreation and other community purposes. Further, these standards and
regulations are established to provide for the design, review and approval of
any development of land within the wastewater management overlay district as
shown on figure 8 of the Wadsworth comprehensive plan update of 2000.
   B.   Districts: A planned unit development may be located in any zoning
district as shown in section
10-5-14, table 8 of this chapter, subject to the procedures and standards set
forth in this section.
   C.   Permitted Uses: Unless expressly modified pursuant to subsection E of
this section, the uses permitted in a planned unit development shall be: 1)
those listed as permitted uses in the underlying zone and any overlay district
in which the property is located, or 2) those uses approved as conditional uses
in accordance with this title, or 3) such other uses as may be approved
pursuant to subsection E of this section.

unit development shall be ten (10) acres.
      3.   Basic Density: The basic density (dwelling units per acre of land)
permitted in any planned unit development shall be as shown in section
10-5-14, table 7, "Site Capacity And Environmental Performance Standards", of
this chapter.
      4.   Number Of Dwelling Units Permitted: The number of dwelling units
permitted in a planned unit development shall be determined by using the site
capacity calculations shown in section
10-5-3, "Site Capacity Regulations", of this chapter.
      5.   Open Space: Open space shall be provided for recreational and other
outdoor benefits and activities. The minimum open space requirements for
particular zoning districts are set forth in section
10-5-14, table 7 of this chapter, but in no event shall be less than twenty
percent (20%), and in the AG district not less than eighty percent (80%), of
the gross site be developed for active or passive recreation, stormwater
detention and other open space uses including the conservation of significant
natural features of the site such as floodplains, wetlands, forests, scenic
areas and vistas. All such areas shall be considered recreational open space
whether or not they are developed for recreational use or left in a natural
state.
      6.   Separation Of Traffic: A planned unit development shall provide
maximum separation of vehicular traffic from pedestrianways and play areas.
      7.   Unified Design: A planned unit development shall provide a unified
design based upon significant architectural features, compatible building
materials and a distinctive arrangement of structures and open spaces.
      8.   Nonresidential Uses: Adequate sites for retail shopping and service
areas, schools, places of worship and other community services may be provided
where the development is large enough to support these services in accordance
with the standards established in this section.
      9.   Surrounding Uses And Property; Relationship Of Development To:
Existing residential developments shall be buffered from all uses in a planned
unit development other than single-family homes and permanent open space. Such
permanent open space including recreational areas shall have an average width
of at least two hundred feet (200') provided that no portion of such a buffer
shall have a minimum width of less than one hundred feet (100').
      10.   Stormwater Detention: Surface drainage and stormwater detention
facilities shall be designed in accordance with the standards of title 11 of
this code.

standards of title 11 of this code.
      14.   Required Setbacks: All structures located on the perimeter of a
planned unit development shall be set back from the property line or street
right of way a distance equal to the required setback in the adjacent zone.
Interior yards and setbacks shall conform to the regulations established in
section
10-5-14, table 8 of this chapter.
      15.   Height Restriction: Any principal structure within a planned unit
development may extend up to thirty five feet (35') in height. Further, a
planned unit development may approve a structure in excess of thirty five feet
(35') in height provided it does not exceed a height determined by a plane
extending inward from a grade at the perimeter of the planned unit development
at an angle of thirty degrees (30°) above the horizontal and provided further
that no structure shall exceed a height of fifty feet (50').
   E.   Departure From Standards: The planned unit development may depart from
strict conformance with the required density, dimension, area, height, bulk,
use and specific content regulations of this title, as well as standards
required by title 11 of this code, but only to the extent specified in the
preliminary development plan and documents authorizing the planned unit
development so long as the planned unit development provides tangible benefits
to the neighborhood or community in which it is located. Benefits to the
community of the planned unit development and the improved design of the
planned unit must justify the intended variation from the normal requirements
of this title. These benefits shall be in the form of provisions of exceptional
amenities, design excellence, etc. The waiver of any requirement shall be the
direct cause of accrual of positive benefits to the residents of the
development as well as to the general community (e.g., waiver of yard
requirements might result in more usable open space). Departure from any
requirement specified in this title or other village ordinances and regulations
is a privilege, and shall be granted only upon recommendation of the zoning
board of appeals and approval by the village board.

      3.   Zoning Board Of Appeals Review And Recommendation:
         a.   Hearing: The zoning board of appeals shall conduct a public
hearing on the application for a conditional use permit for a planned unit
development, any requested departures under subsection E of this section, and
the proposed preliminary development plan in accordance with the procedures
established for conditional use permits in this section. In addition to the
notice required by state statute, notice of the application for preliminary
development plan approval shall be given by the petitioner by registered or
certified first class mail, at least fifteen (15) days before the date of the
ZBA meeting at which it will be considered, to the owners of record of all
parcels of land to a depth of three (3) separate owners but not to exceed
within one thousand three hundred twenty feet (1,320') from the perimeter of
the proposed planned unit development; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall require a developer to give notice to the owners of property located
outside the village.
         b.   Decision: Following the public hearing and review of the
application for approval of the preliminary development plan, the zoning board
of appeals shall, within thirty (30) days, unless an extension is requested by
the applicant, recommend approval, modification, or disapproval of the
conditional use permit for a planned unit development, requested departures,
and approval of a preliminary development plan, and the reasons therefor, or
indicate why a report and recommendation cannot be rendered to the village
board. The zoning board of appeals may recommend such special conditions as it
may deem necessary to ensure conformance with the objectives and standards
established in this section. The failure of the zoning board of appeals to act
within thirty (30) days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree,
shall be deemed a recommendation for the denial of the conditional use permit,
requested departures, and proposed preliminary development plan as submitted.
      4.   Plan Commission Review And Recommendation:
         a.   Meeting: The application for preliminary development plan
approval shall be submitted to the plan commission for review at a public
meeting.
         b.   Decision: Following a public meeting and review of the
application for approval of the preliminary development plan, the supporting
documents, and village consultants' review letters, the plan commission shall
review the preliminary development plan and within thirty (30) days, unless an
extension is requested by the applicant, recommend approval, modification, or
disapproval of the preliminary development plan, and the reasons therefor, or
indicate why a report and recommendation cannot be rendered to the village
board. The plan commission may recommend such special conditions as it may deem
necessary to ensure conformance with the objectives and standards established
in this section. The failure of the plan commission to act within thirty (30)
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a
recommendation for the denial of the preliminary development plan as submitted.
      5.   Village Board Decision: Within sixty (60) days following the receipt
of the recommendations of the plan commission and the zoning board of appeals,
or their failure to act as above provided, the board of trustees shall either:
a) deny the application for approval of the preliminary development plan; b)
refer it back to the plan commission and/or zoning board of appeals for further
consideration of specified matters; or c) approve by ordinance the preliminary
development plan, conditional use permit, and departures under subsection E of
this section, with or without modifications and conditions to be accepted by
the applicant as a condition of such approval, to permit development of the
planned unit development as approved; provided, however, that every such
ordinance and conditional use permit shall be expressly conditioned upon
approval of the final development plan in accordance with subsection H of this
section upon the applicant's compliance with all provisions of this code and
the ordinance granting the conditional use permit. The failure of the board of
trustees to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying approval of the
preliminary development plan.
      6.   Effect Of Preliminary Development Plan Approval: Approval of a
preliminary development plan shall not constitute approval of the final
development plan. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the
layout submitted on the preliminary development plan as a guide to the
preparation of the final development plan which will be submitted for approval
of the village and subsequent recording upon the fulfillment of the
requirements of these regulations and conditions of the preliminary approval,
if any. No building or construction, excluding public improvements, may take
place within the proposed planned unit development, and no permits may be
issued, until the final development plan and accompanying data has been
submitted, approved, and recorded.
      7.   Limitation On Preliminary Development Plan Approval: Subject to an
extension of time granted by the village board, unless a final development plan
covering at least the area designated in the preliminary development plan as
the first phase or unit of the planned unit development has been filed within
two (2) years from the date the board of trustees grants preliminary
development plan approval, or in any case where the applicant fails to file the
final development plan and to proceed with development in accordance with the
provisions of this code, the preliminary development plan approval shall
automatically expire and be rendered void.
   H.   Final Development Plan Process (Step Three):
      1.   Application: Within two (2) years of the approval of a preliminary
development plan in accordance with subsection G of this section, the applicant
shall submit a completed final development plan application. The final
development plans may be filed in phases in accordance with the development
schedule. The final development plan application shall include, at a minimum,
the following:
         a.   All final engineering documents as required by the subdivision
regulations, title 11 of this code, or as otherwise required by the conditional
use permit.
         b.   A final plat prepared in accordance with the regulations of title
11 of this code showing thereon all easements for utilities, stormwater
management, the protection of landscaping, scenic easement and resource
protection as required by village ordinance.
         c.   Final landscape plan prepared in conformance with title 12 of
this code.
         d.   Final resource protection plan in conformance with subsection
10-5-3E of this chapter.
         e.   Agreements, bylaws, provisions or covenants which govern the use,
maintenance and continued protection of the planned unit development and any of
its common open areas, streets, parking facilities or other facilities and
improvements in final form as approved by the village attorney.
         f.   Signed copies of all agreements covering school, park, library
and fire protection donations as approved by the village attorney.
         g.   Receipts for the payment of all fees required by the village.
      2.   Consultant Report: Within thirty (30) days of submittal of a
complete final development plan application and supporting documents the
village planner, village engineer, and village attorney will provide a written
report with recommendations to the village plan commission and the village
board.
      3.   Plan Commission Review And Recommendation: The plan commission shall
review the final development plan at a public meeting. Within thirty (30) days
after the conclusion of the plan commission's review of the final development
plan, the plan commission shall make a report and recommendation to the village
board as to whether the final development plan conforms to the requirements of
the applicable ordinances and is in substantial conformance with the approved
preliminary development plan. The failure of the plan commission to act within
thirty (30) days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision recommending denial of the preliminary development
plan.
      4.   Village Board Decision: Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the
recommendation of the plan commission, the village board shall approve, approve
with conditions, or disapprove the final development plan. Any approval or
approval with conditions shall be in the form of an ordinance. The failure of
the board of trustees to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to
which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying
approval of the final development plan.
   I.   Modification Of Plan:
      1.   The Village Board may, from time to time, approve minor changes
within a planned unit development. Such changes:
         a.   Shall not increase the density or number of dwelling units
permitted in the planned unit development.
         b.   Shall not abrogate any design or development standard governing
the development of the planned unit whether established by ordinance, by
variance or by the issuance of a conditional use permit.

shall be a major change and must follow the procedures for approval of a
preliminary development plan as set forth in subsection G of this section,
including the issuance of a new conditional use permit.
   J.   Failure To Complete Improvements: All public improvements shall be
completed within two (2) years of final approval. At its discretion and for
good cause, the Village Board may extend, for one additional year, the period
for the completion of public improvements.
   K.   Fire District Review Fee: At the time of final development plan
approval, and prior to recording of the final plat, the developer shall pay a
fire district review fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per dwelling unit or
such other amount as may be established from time to time by the Village Board
or such other amount as may be specifically approved by the Village Board for a
particular planned unit development. For commercial and all other
nonresidential lots within a planned unit development, the developer shall pay
a fire district review fee as determined by the Village Board for the
particular development. Upon receipt by the Village, the fire district review
fees shall be remitted to the fire district within which the property is
located. (Ord. 2010-815, 5-18-2010)
10-5-7: STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY USES:
   A.   Uses Permitted As Accessory Uses: The term accessory use includes, but
is not limited to, the following:
      1.   Generally: Uses which are permitted in a particular zone only as
accessory uses as shown in section
10-4-4, table 1, "Uses Permitted In Zones", of this title, even though such
uses may be principal uses elsewhere. In the zones indicated, such uses shall
not be established as principal uses and must be accessory to a permitted
principal use existing and being maintained and operated as such at the time of
establishment of the accessory use. Such accessory use may serve a broader
public or market than the principal use to which it is accessory. (Ord. 94-397,
4-5-1994)
      2.   For Residential Uses (SE, SR And SD Districts):
         a.   Stables, barns, gazebos, private greenhouses, sheds or buildings
for domestic storage are accessory buildings to a single-family dwelling.
Freestanding garages up to a size of seven hundred twenty (720) square feet
will not be considered accessory buildings in homes which lack an attached
garage but will be considered part of the principal building. No more than two
(2) accessory buildings (freestanding accessory structures) will be permitted.
In the event that the detached garage exceeds seven hundred twenty (720) square
feet, then any excess over seven hundred twenty (720) square feet shall be
included in the total aggregate square footage permitted as accessory
buildings. (Ord. 2014-924, 5-6-2014)
         b.   One story detached accessory structures used as tool or storage
sheds, children's playhouses, chicken coop, and similar uses may be built
without foundation or footing, provided the floor area of the structure does
not exceed one hundred twenty (120) square feet. A permit from the Village will
be needed before construction. Tool or storage sheds, children's playhouses,
and chicken coops under one hundred (100) square feet will not be counted
against one's accessory buildings allotment, provided that only one such
structure of said types will receive this exemption. (Ord. 2019-1060, 5-7-2019)
         c.   All other accessory buildings must be permanent in nature and
built of masonry, wood frame or post frame and must comply with any applicable
foundation or footing requirements as specified by the International
Residential Code, as it may be amended from time to time, as well as applicable
permit requirements of this Code.
Metal garages, open air buildings such as carports, fabric/plexiglas or plastic
enclosed buildings (greenhouses excepted) and PODS type storage buildings are
not permitted. PODS type storage buildings may be used on a temporary basis not
to exceed thirty (30) days as long as use of said building is in conjunction
with a move or construction project. All accessory buildings must be compatible
in appearance with the principal building. Compatibility shall include similar
color schemes in agreement with the principal building. All accessory building
plans must adhere to Village Building Codes and Village Zoning Codes and must
be approved by the Lake County Health Department and the Village building
inspector. (Ord. 2014-924, 5-6-2014)
         d.   The total square footage of all accessory buildings on a parcel
or lot is to be determined by the total square footage of the living space of
the single-family dwelling and the size of the lot or parcel.
The maximum square footage that the accessory buildings may aggregate shall be
determined as follows:
            (1)   In the SD (properties over 1 acre in size), SE and SR Zoning
Districts, fifty percent (50%) of the total living space of the single-family
dwelling (not including the basement) and an additional percentage of the total
living space of the single- family dwelling (not including the basement) as
follows:
               (A)   Less than two (2) acres: No additional square footage is
permitted;
               (B)   Two (2) acres or more but less than three (3) acres:
Twelve and five-tenths percent (12.5%) of the living space of the principal
building (excluding basement);
               (C)   Three (3) acres or more but less than four (4) acres:
Twenty five percent (25%) of the living space of the principal building
(excluding basement);
               (D)   Four (4) acres or more but less than five (5) acres:
Thirty seven and five-tenths percent (37.5%) of the living space of the
principal building (excluding basement);
               (E)   Five (5) acres or more: Fifty percent (50%) of the living
space of the principal building (excluding basement).
As an example, on a three (3) acre lot with a principal dwelling consisting of
three thousand (3,000) square feet of total living space, the total aggregate
square footage of accessory buildings that would be permitted would equal fifty
percent (50%) of three thousand (3,000) square feet, or one thousand five
hundred (1,500) square feet, plus twenty five percent (25%) of three thousand
(3,000) square feet, or seven hundred fifty (750) square feet, for a total
permitted square footage of all accessory structures of two thousand two
hundred fifty (2,250) square feet.
               (F)   No industrial or commercial uses shall be permitted for
accessory buildings in residential areas, except as specifically shown in
section
10-4-4, table 1 of this title. The maximum allowable area covered by accessory
buildings shall never exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the square footage
of the living area of the principal building (excluding basement). Accessory
buildings must also satisfy all other requirements of this title, including
applicable lot coverage limitations.
            (2)   In the SD (properties less than 1 acre in size) Zoning
District, the total square footage of all accessory buildings shall be computed
in accordance with all of the terms and provisions of section
10-4-4, table 2 of this title. No industrial or commercial uses shall be
permitted for accessory buildings in the SD District, except as specifically
shown in section
10-4-4, table 1 of this title. (Ord. 2008-759, 6-17-2008)

   C.   Computations And Measurements:
      1.   Sign Area Of Individual Signs: The area of a sign face (which is
also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only 1 face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral section of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when such supporting device otherwise meets the regulations of this
section and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
      2.   Area Of Double Faced Signs: Where the sign faces of a double faced
sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is ninety degrees
(90°) or less, only one display face shall be counted in computing sign area.
If the two (2) faces of a double faced sign are of unequal area, the area of
the sign shall be the area of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the
areas of all faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the
area of the sign.
      3.   Height: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to
the highest point of the sign or sign structure, measured from the elevation of
the road to which it is oriented, or, if there is no road, from the natural
ground elevation beneath the sign.
      4.   Wall Area: In computing the area of a wall only the first twelve
feet (12') of building height shall be used.
      5.   Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area For A Lot: The permitted sum of
the area of all individual signs on a lot shall be computed by applying the
formula set out in table 2, "Maximum Total Sign Area Per Lot", of this section
to the lot frontage, building frontage, or wall area, as specified in the
table. Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets shall be allowed the stated
sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is
oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's
total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area
frontage on that street.
   D.   Signs Permitted In All Districts:
      1.   Any public notice or warning required by a valid and applicable
federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance.

Notes
1 1. This street classification is adopted solely for the establishment and
  implementation of this section.
10-5-9: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent the
congestion of the public streets and to promote the safety and welfare of the
public by establishing minimum requirements for the off street parking and
loading and unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which
property is put and the district in which it is located.
   B.   General Provisions:
      1.   Procedure: An application for a building permit for a new, enlarged,
or modified building, structure or use shall include therewith a plot plan in
duplicate, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or loading
facilities to be provided in compliance with the requirements of this title.
      2.   Extent Of Control: All buildings, structures, and uses and all
modifications of existing buildings, structures, and uses initiated after the
effective date hereof shall be provided with accessory off street parking or
loading facilities as required herein. A building, structure or use for which a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date hereof shall comply
with the requirement in effect at the time of issuance of the permit, until
such building, structure, or use is enlarged or otherwise modified, or a new
use is initiated, in which case the preceding sentence shall apply.
      3.   Existing Parking And Loading Spaces: Accessory off street parking
and loading spaces in existence on the effective date hereof may not be reduced
in number, except in compliance with the requirements of this section.
      4.   Permissive Parking And Loading Spaces: Nothing in this section shall
prevent the establishment of off street automobile parking or loading
facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, subject to the
provisions of this section, except that existing off street parking areas
accessory to existing uses cannot be located off the lot containing the main
use unless on a lot adjacent thereto.
      5.   Joint Parking Facilities: Joint off street parking facilities may be
provided for different buildings, structures, or uses, or for mixed uses;
provided, however, that in no event shall joint parking facilities for
compatible uses be reduced below the number required for all uses. Joint
parking facilities for dissimilar uses which require parking at different times
during the day may be reduced by not more than thirty five percent (35%) of the
required number of spaces where the zoning officer finds that such a reduction
will not result in any increased congestion in the public streets and will not
otherwise violate the intent and purpose of this title. The zoning officer may
require a shared parking study to determine if a reduction is warranted.
      6.   Control Of Off Site Parking: When required accessory parking
facilities for existing uses are provided elsewhere than on the lot on which
the principal use served is located they shall be in the same possession as the
property occupied by such principal use, and the owner shall be bound by
covenants filed of record in the office of the recorder of deeds, Lake County,
Illinois, requiring the owner and his or her said heirs and assigns to maintain
the required number of parking spaces during the existence of said principal
use. Such off site parking facilities shall not be provided for new uses.
Further, such facilities shall not be located in any agricultural or
residential district.
   C.   Required Spaces: Off street parking spaces shall be provided in
accordance with the following schedule of requirements:

SECTION:
10-6-1: Purpose And Intent
10-6-2: Nonconforming Lots
10-6-3: Nonconforming Structures
10-6-4: Nonconforming Uses
10-6-5: Nonconforming Accessory Uses
10-6-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
In addition to and in support of the purpose and intent for which this Title is
enacted generally, this Chapter is enacted for the following specific purposes
and intent:
   A.   To establish standards for the continued maintenance and operation of
existing nonconforming buildings and structures where the outright or gradual
elimination of such buildings and structures would cause undue hardship.
   B.   To provide for the elimination, over time, of nonconforming uses of
lots, structures and buildings which are adaptable to conforming uses.
   C.   To encourage the preservation and restoration of landmark buildings and
places of historic interest and aesthetic merit.
   D.   To establish procedures for the inspection and restoration of
nonconforming uses which are in violation of the provisions of this Title and
the other land development ordinances of the Village. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-6-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
Any vacant lot established prior to the adoption of the Ordinance codified in
this Title and which was in compliance with the requirements of the Ordinance
in effect at the time of its establishment but which now fails to meet the
minimum area or width requirements of this Title or of the district in which it
is located may be used, developed, maintained or redeveloped in conformance
with the following standards:
   A.   A nonconforming lot may be used for any use in the district in which it
is located except that any use for which there is an extraordinary area
requirement or width requirement shall not be permitted use for a nonconforming
lot. Such extraordinary area or width requirement may be found in Table 2,
Section
10-4-4, or in Sections
10-5-4,
10-5-5 or
10-5-6 of this Title. A permit for an on-site waste water disposal system as
issued by the Lake County Health Department shall be required prior to the
establishment or enlargement of a use on a nonconforming lot.
   B.   All regulations and standards of this Title other than those
established for area and width shall be met.
   C.   The provisions of the other land development ordinances of the Village,
including but not limited to the Flood Plain Ordinance, Title 9, and the
Subdivision Control Ordinance, Title 11, shall also apply to the use of
nonconforming lots.
   D.   No subdivision, plat, vacation or other division of a lot or other
parcel of land shall be made that would result in establishment of a
nonconforming lot.
   E.   Relief from these provisions shall only be granted by the issuance of a
variation as provided by this Title.
   F.   A nonconforming lot shall not be entitled to the establishment,
enlargement or extension of either a nonconforming use or a nonconforming
structure solely by virtue of its nonconformance.
   G.   With respect to the provisions of this Chapter regarding the
regulations and restrictions upon nonconforming uses and structures,
nonconforming lot shall be entitled to the same consideration as conforming
lots except that practical difficulties arising from the nonconformance or the
degree of nonconformance may be considered in the regulation of any use or
structure thereon.
   H.   A lot which is or was illegally created shall not become a legal
nonconforming lot solely by virtue of the enactment of this Title. (Ord. 91-
341, 4-2-1991)
   I.   Within the Southeast District, the following special provisions shall
apply:
      1.   A nonconforming recorded lot is a tract of land, designated on a
duly recorded subdivision plat or by other lawful means which has less than the
minimum lot area or width or other dimension prescribed for the Southeast
District, and which met the lot area, width and other dimensions for the zone
in which it was located at the time of such recording.
      2.   A nonconforming recorded lot shall be subject to the following
provisions:
         a.   Permitted Uses: A nonconforming recorded lot may only be used for
a single-family dwelling and accessory uses.
         b.   Side And Rear Yards: Each side yard and rear yard for principal
building shall be ten percent (10%) of the lot width except that any yard shall
be a minimum of four feet (4'). For corner lots, the minimum side yard abutting
the side street shall be thirty feet (30').
         c.   Front Yard Requirements: The minimum front yard requirement of
twenty percent (20%) of the depth of a nonconforming recorded lot shall be
required.
         d.   Buildable Width On Corner Lots: On a nonconforming recorded
corner lot the buildable width shall be at least equal to twenty two feet (22')
plus one foot (1') for each two feet (2') that the width of the lot exceeds
twenty four feet (24') less than the area required for the interior yard.
         e.   Setback Of Accessory Buildings: A new or relocated accessory
building need not be set back from the main front wall of the nearest existing
accessory building or principal structure more than one foot (1') for each four
feet (4') of distance between such adjoining buildings.
         f.   Nonconforming Recorded Subdivisions: It is the intent of this
Section to regulate the development of subdivisions where substantial portions
of the blocks or lots, or the entire subdivision, are nonconforming and
undeveloped without adequate access.
         g.   Regulation: Where platted subdivisions existed on or before March
31, 1966, containing nonconforming lots where roads have not been installed,
and where these lots do not have direct access to an improved and approved
street, and are held in common ownership, these lots shall be combined to meet
the minimum requirements of the Lake County Health Department for septic
systems and individuals wells, but in no case shall the lot size be less than
the minimum requirements of the NC/UR-3 zone of the Lake County Zoning
Ordinance in effect as of April 11, 1997.
         h.   Exception: Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein,
if the applicant can prove that he would have qualified for a building permit
for the desired structure had such a permit been applied for to the Lake County
Building Department after January 1, 1997, but prior to February 4, 1997, then
in that event, such use shall not be prohibited by this District provided that
said use is confined to a single-family residence or related accessory
structure. (Ord. 97-476, 4-15-1997)
10-6-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
Any building or other structure established, built, remodeled or enlarged prior
to the adoption of this Title, or any building or other structure established,
built, remodeled or enlarged in compliance with the regulations in effect at
the time, but which now fails to meet the yard, height, bulk or similar
requirements of the district in which it is located, shall only be used,
maintained, remodeled, enlarged or otherwise altered in conformance with the
following standards:
   A.   Repairs And Alterations:
      1.   Repairs and alterations may be made to a nonconforming building or
structure, provided that no structural alteration which increases the bulk of
the building or structure shall be made in or to a nonconforming building or
structure; all or substantially all of which is designated or intended to
accommodate a use not currently allowed in the district in which it is located,
except those required by law or except to make the building or structure and
the use thereof, conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located. For the purpose of this Section, repairs shall include the replacement
or of substitutions for, building machinery or other mechanical equipment not
involving structural alterations to the building or structure, except as
hereinabove provided.
      2.   Repairs, alterations and structural changes may be made to a
nonconforming building or structure, all or substantially all of which is
designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is
located, provided said repairs, alterations or structural changes conform to
the regulations of the district in which said building or structure is located.
   B.   Additions And Enlargements: A nonconforming building or structure which
is nonconforming as to the yard, lot or bulk regulations and is designed or
intended for a permitted use, shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner
unless such additions or enlargements thereto are made to conform to all of the
regulations of the district in which it is located and unless such
nonconforming building or structure, including all additions and enlargements
thereto, shall conform to the following:
      1.   Applicable regulations concerning the amount of lot area provided
per dwelling unit, as established in this title.
      2.   The allowable floor area ratio as provided in this title.
      3.   The allowable gross floor area per establishment, as provided in
this title.
      4.   The parking space requirements contained in section
10-5-9 of this title.
   C.   Relocation Of Building Or Structure: No building or structure shall be
moved in whole or in part to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless every portion of such building or structure which is moved, and the use
thereof, is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in which
it is to be located. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
   D.   Restoration Of Damaged Structure: A nonconforming building or structure
which is destroyed or damaged by fire, other casualty or act of God to the
extent that the estimated restoration of the building to its condition before
the occurrence exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the original square footage of
the entire building in the opinion of the village, shall not be restored unless
said building or structure, and the use thereof, shall conform to all of the
regulations of the district in which it is located. In the event that the
restoration of such damage or destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of
the original square footage of the entire building in the opinion of the
village, the building may be restored to its original condition; however, no
such repair or reconstruction shall be made unless started within one year from
the date of partial destruction and completed within one year thereafter. If
the restoration is not started within one year of the occurrence and diligently
prosecuted to completion, then the owner shall cause the building or structure
to be removed and the area cleared. (Ord. 2013-898, 6-18-2013)
   E.   Dilapidated Structure: Any nonconforming structure which remains
unoccupied for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months and is in a
dilapidated condition or in an unsafe condition as provided in the building
code shall be removed.
   F.   Existing Parcels: To avoid extreme hardship, any parcel which is
situated within the agricultural, suburban estate or suburban residential
zoning district, which existed as of April 2, 1991, shall be deemed to be a
conforming parcel, provided that the total square footage area of the parcel
equals not less than ninety percent (90%) of the square footage required within
the zoning district in which it is located. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-6-4: NONCONFORMING USES:
Any use other than a conditional use which was established prior to the
adoption of this title or which was a permitted use in the district in which it
was established at the time of its establishment, but which is not now a use
permitted in the district in which it is located, may be continued, maintained,
enlarged, relocated or discontinued only in accordance with the following
standards and regulations:
   A.   Additions Or Enlargements: A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or
expanded. For the purpose of this subsection, "enlargement or expansion" shall
mean any increase in the floor area occupied by the use beyond building in
which it is located or any expansion onto a lot in any district in which the
use would also be a nonconforming use.
   B.   Alterations To Structure: There shall be no enlargement, expansion,
structural alteration or increase in the bulk of a building or structure
containing a nonconforming use except that such enlargement shall be in all
respects conforming to the regulations of the district in which it is located
and the use of such enlarged portion of the structure is a permitted use
subject to the issuance of a conditional use permit. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
   C.   Damaged Or Destroyed Buildings:
      1.   Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use which is
destroyed or damaged to the extent that the restoration to its condition before
the occurrence exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the original square footage of
the entire building in the opinion of the village, shall only be restored for
use as a permitted use or a conditional use subject to the issuance of a
conditional use permit. Such restored building shall conform to the regulations
of the district in which it is located.
      2.   Any building or structure containing a nonconforming use which is
destroyed or damaged to the extent that the restoration to its condition before
the occurrence is less than fifty percent (50%) of the original square footage
of the entire building in the opinion of the village, may be restored to its
original condition and may be used to continue the nonconforming use subject to
the provisions for nonconforming uses herein.
      3.   No damaged or destroyed nonconforming use permitted to be
reestablished as provided herein shall be reestablished without the issuance of
an occupancy permit. (Ord. 2013-898, 6-18-2013)
   D.   Discontinued Use:
      1.   If the nonconforming use of any building or structure is
discontinued for a period of one year or if a building or structure containing
a nonconforming use remains vacant for whatever reason for a period of one
year, the nonconforming use of such a building or structure shall be considered
abandoned and the building or structure thereafter shall only be used for a
permitted use or a conditional use subject to the issuance of a conditional use
permit, except as provided in subsection D2 of this section.
      2.   The nonconforming use of a unique structure, if abandoned as
provided above, may be reestablished as the same nonconforming use or as
another nonconforming use requiring no physical adaptation of the structure
provided that such use shall not be expanded or enlarged beyond the size of the
original nonconforming use.
      3.   A discontinued or abandoned nonconforming use permitted to be
reestablished as provided herein shall not be reestablished without the
issuance of an occupancy permit.
   E.   Change Of Use:
      1.   The nonconforming use of a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which is designed or intended to accommodate a use not
currently allowed in the district in which it is located, may be changed to a
use allowed in the most restrictive district in which the nonconforming use
which presently occupies the building or structure is a permitted or a
conditional use or to a use permitted in a more restrictive district. For the
purpose of this subsection, the AG district shall be considered the most
restrictive and the LI district the least restrictive district. Such a change
of use shall not result in the enlargement of the nonconforming use or
structure.
      2.   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming
use when such nonconforming use is located in a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a
permitted use.
      3.   The nonconforming use of land not involving a building or structure
thereon which is incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land shall
not be changed to any other use, except to a use permitted in the district in
which the land is located.
   F.   Industrial Uses: Any industrial use which is a nonconforming use in the
district in which it is located shall comply with the industrial performance
standards established in section
10-5-1 of this title. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)
10-6-5: NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES:
Any accessory use either permitted or required by this title which was
established prior to the adoption of this title or which was a permitted
accessory use at the time of establishment of such accessory use shall be
continued, enlarged, replaced or removed only in accordance with the following
regulations and standards:
   A.   Signs: All nonconforming signs shall be removed or relocated to a
permitted location within one year of the adoption of this title or any
amendment hereto which results in the nonconformance.
   B.   Parking And Loading: The off street parking and loading requirements
and standards established in section
10-5-9 of this title are equally applicable to conforming and nonconforming
uses. Failure to provide adequate off street parking and loading facilities
shall not establish a use as a nonconforming use. The following regulations
shall apply:
      1.   Any use for which off street parking and loading standards are
established by this title which is a nonconforming use shall either provide or
expand the parking in conformance with the requirements for such use as a
permitted use or as otherwise approved by the village board or shall reduce the
area, extent, number of employees or other appropriate measure to conform to
the parking available. The nonconforming status of the principal use shall not
be used as a basis for determining a lesser parking requirement than that
established by this title.
      2.   Any permitted use in a district for which off street parking and
loading standards are established by this title shall provide parking in
conformance with such standards or as otherwise approved by the village board
within one year of the adoption of this title or any amendment thereto which
results in the nonconformance.
   C.   Other Accessory Uses And Buildings: Any other nonconforming structure
or use accessory to either a permitted or a nonconforming use shall be
regulated by the provisions of this chapter as they otherwise apply to
nonconforming principal structures and uses. (Ord. 91-341, 4-2-1991)

regulations at all times.
      5.   Time Limit And Notification: All applications for conditional use
permits shall be decided within sixty (60) days of the date of the public
hearing and the applicant shall be provided with either a conditional use
permit or written notice of the denial.
   B.   Variations: It is the intent of this Title to use the variation only to
modify the application of this Title to achieve a parity among properties
similarly located and classified. Specifically, it is to be used to overcome
some exceptional physical condition which poses practical difficulty or
unnecessary hardship in such a way as to prevent an owner from using his
property as intended by this Title.
      1.   Application: After denial of a building permit by the Zoning
Officer, a property owner may apply to the Zoning Board for a variation, using
forms obtainable from the Zoning Officer.
      2.   Public Hearing: Upon receipt of an application and fee, the Zoning
Board shall hold a public hearing after giving fifteen (15) days' notice as
provided by law. The Zoning Board shall consider and make recommendations to
the Village Board on all applications for variations within thirty (30) days of
such public hearing. The Village Board shall decide all applications for
variations within thirty (30) days after transmittal from the Zoning Board.
      3.   Standards For Variations: The Village shall grant a variation
whenever, and only when, it shall have determined, recorded in writing and
placed in its records on forms to be provided by the Zoning Officer, that all
of the following conditions have been met:
         a.   That the variation does not permit a use otherwise excluded from
the particular zone in which requested.
         b.   That special circumstances or conditions such as exceptional
narrowness, topography or siting, fully described in the report of the Zoning
Board, apply to the land for which a variation is sought and that those
conditions do not apply generally in the zone.
         c.   That special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from
any act of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this Title, whether or
not a violation of the provisions thereof.
         d.   That, for reasons fully set forth in the report of the Zoning
Board, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Title results in the loss of any
reasonable use of land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variation; there
must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land.
         e.   That the variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary
for the reasonable use of the land.
         f.   That the granting of any variation is in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of this Title and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare or in conflict with the
Comprehensive Plan for development of the Village.
   C.   Amendments: This Title may be amended from time to time as conditions
warrant, subject to the following conditions:
      1.   Application: An application for a proposed amendment shall be filed

challenge of changing conditions in the area and the zones affected;
            (2)   The proposed amendment shall be consistent with the intent of
this Title and with its various provisions;
            (3)   The proposed amendment shall not be detrimental to the
development of the Village.
         b.   Map Amendments: In addition to the above conditions, the
following shall be met for all map changes:
            (1)   Every use permitted under the new classifications must be a
suitable use for the further development of the area in the vicinity of the
rezoning and must be compatible with uses already developed in the vicinity;
and

VILLAGE: The Village of Wadsworth. (Ord. 98-494, 2-17-1998)
10-9-2: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   District Height Limitations: The requirements set forth in this Chapter
shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are
installed at, a height in excess of the height limitations specified for each
zoning district.
   B.   Public Property: Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased,
or otherwise controlled by the Village shall be exempt from the requirements of
this Chapter, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has
been approved by the Village.
   C.   Amateur Radio Antennas: This Chapter shall not govern any tower, or the
installation of any antenna, that is under seventy feet (70') in height and is
owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator for
that purpose only. (Ord. 98-494, 2-17-1998)
10-9-3: GENERAL GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose; Goals:
      1.   The purpose of this Chapter is to establish general guidelines for
the siting of towers and antennas.
      2.   The goals of this Chapter are to:
         a.   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and
minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
         b.   Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
         c.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
         d.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
         e.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications
services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and
efficiently.
   B.   Principal Or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing
structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an
antenna or tower on such lot or parcel. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development
regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or
parcel shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on
leased parcels within such lots or parcels. Towers that are constructed, and
antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter
shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or
structure.
   C.   Inventory Of Existing Sites: Each applicant for an antenna and or tower
shall provide to the Village an inventory of its existing towers that are
either within the jurisdiction of the Village or within one mile of the border
thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design
of each tower. The Village may share such information with other applicants
applying for permits under this Chapter or other organizations seeking to
locate antennas within the Village, provided, however, that the Village is not,
by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such
sites are available or suitable.
   D.   Aesthetics: The guidelines set forth in this Section shall govern the
location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this
Chapter; provided, however, that the Village may waive these requirements to
the extent necessary if it determines that the goals of this Chapter are better
served thereby.
      1.   Finish: Towers shall have a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      2.   Design: At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related
structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures,
screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural
setting and existing structures.
      3.   Supporting Structure: If an antenna is installed on a structure
other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical
equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely
compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the
antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
      4.   Lighting: Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required
by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Village
shall review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that
would cause the least visual disturbance. No illumination system may be
utilized to illuminate the support building or the balance of the installation,
except as explicitly required by Federal law.
   E.   Federal Requirements: All installations must comply with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, all other applicable Federal and State laws
and regulations, as well as the standards contained in the Wadsworth Building
Code 1  and must specifically meet or exceed current standards and regulations
of the FAA, the FCC, and any other applicable Federal or State regulations. If
such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this Chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling Federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.
   F.   Building Codes; Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance
with the Village Building Codes 2  and the applicable standards for towers that
are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to
time. If, upon inspection, the Village concludes that a tower fails to comply
with such codes and standards, and constitutes a danger to persons or property,
then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have
thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If
the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30)
days, the Village may remove such tower at the owner's expense.
   G.   General Criteria For All Installations:
      1.   A cash bond to be deposited equivalent to one hundred twenty five
percent (125%) of the estimated cost of maintenance for a ten (10) year period
and the cost of removal and disposal of the entire installation, as determined
by the Village Engineer or such other expert designated by the Village from
time to time.
      2.   As to each installation, the entire site, including the tower and
outbuilding, must be kept maintained and in good condition, as reasonably
determined by the Village Engineer. If the owner of the installation fails to
maintain the site, the Village, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, or
in the event of an emergency such prior notice, if any, which is practicable,
may perform the necessary repairs, maintenance, or removal of the installation,
as it deems appropriate, and all costs so incurred shall be the responsibility
of the owner of the installation.
      3.   No installation may be situated within five hundred feet (500') of
residence situated in an SE, SR, or SD District. No installation shall be
permitted in the Historic Overlay District or within any scenic corridor.
      4.   Sufficient vegetative screening shall be installed so that within
ten (10) years of planting, the base portion of the site, to a height of twenty
five feet (25'), shall not be visible from any adjacent parcel, or a public
right of way, when viewed from six feet (6') above existing grade on the
adjacent parcel or right of way. All trees to be planted shall be of approved
type as specified in the Wadsworth Landscape Ordinance 3 .
      5.   No permit shall be issued if another technology is reasonably
available that eliminates the need for a communication tower.
      6.   The base support building shall not exceed twelve feet (12') in
height nor shall the footprint of the building be larger than twelve feet by
fifteen feet (12' x 15'). For multiple user installations, the footprint may be
expanded if reasonably necessary, provided that the footprint shall be no
larger than absolutely necessary and shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of the Plan Commission. Each such building must have a conventional
peaked roof, as opposed to a flat roof, to facilitate its melding into the
community.
      7.   For all new installations, the tower shall be constructed in such a
fashion to accommodate three (3) antenna/transmitter devices. Competitors shall
be required to collocate their respective facilities on the same installation
to the extent reasonably possible, with each party responsible for its
proportionate share of the cost of the facilities. In the event that said
parties cannot agree on the appropriate allocation of costs, then each party
shall appoint an arbitrator, who collectively shall select an additional
arbitrator, who shall thereafter as a panel arbitrate the dispute and issue a
binding decision on the respective parties.
      8.   No tower shall be located in such a fashion that if it were to
collapse it could fall on any structure which is occupied by humans, excluding
the support building, or could fall off-site from the parcel upon which it is
located.
      9.   The installation must be operated in such a fashion so that it does
not disrupt television or radio signals to residents or occupants within the
Village, impact on hearing aid operation or other medical devices such as
pacemakers, or otherwise disrupt or have a harmful effect on any existing
operations, installations, or technologies existent within the Village.
      10.   No installation may be installed in any wetland or flood plain, nor
in any other location where it is likely to harm or cause damage to human or
animal life or to property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tower portion of
the installation may be located in a conservancy district area if no damage
would occur to the conservancy district area and the tower would be
structurally sound.
      11.   The permittee must indemnify and hold harmless the Village from any
and all liability on a Village-approved form.
      12.   The permittee shall post and maintain in full force and effect a
general liability policy with the Village as named insured in an amount no less
than three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) per occurrence and five million
dollars ($5,000,000.00) in the aggregate.
      13.   The maximum height of the tower shall not exceed one hundred twenty
five feet (125') above existing grade at the situs of the tower.
      14.   The permittee must obtain and maintain all required Federal
licenses and permits, and effectuate and maintain all required registrations.
      15.   A landscape plan must be reviewed and approved by the CTC, or the
Plan Commission, if a conditional use permit is required.
      16.   The permittee must demonstrate that other facilities are not
reasonably available for intended installation, such as, but not limited to,
towers of competitors and other available towers or sites such as Commonwealth
Edison transmission towers.
      17.   The permittee must demonstrate sufficient financial resources to
install, maintain, and operate the installation and associated tower grid.
Towers built on speculation by applicants who do not have the ability to
provide service are prohibited.
   H.   Permit Fee: The permit applicant shall pay a permit fee of one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) at the time of permit application. (Ord. 98-494, 2-17-1998)

      5.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
      6.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
      7.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
      8.   Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as
discussed in subsection D of this Section.
   D.   Availability Of Suitable Existing Towers Or Other Structures: No new
tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Village that no existing tower or structure can accommodate
the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no
existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna
may consist of any of the following:
      1.   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
      2.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
      3.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      4.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
      5.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      6.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
   E.   Setbacks And Separation: The following setbacks and separation
requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use
permit is required:
      1.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower
from any off-site residential structure.
      2.   Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
      3.   In zoning districts other than CR, OR, LI, LI-1 or PL, towers over
ninety feet (90') in height shall not be located within one-quarter (1/4) of a
mile from any existing tower that is over ninety feet (90') in height.
   F.   Security Fencing: Towers shall be enclosed by approved security fencing
not less than six feet (6') in height and shall also be equipped with an
appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the Village may waive
such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
   G.   Landscaping: The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a conditional use permit is required; provided,
however, that the Village may waive such requirements if the goals of this
Chapter would be better served thereby:
      1.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent
residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip
at least four feet (4') wide outside the perimeter of the compound. The
perimeter of the installation site shall be planted with canopy trees to screen
towers from view from off-site.
      2.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
      3.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall
be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers
sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may
be sufficient buffer. (Ord. 98-494, 2-17-1998)
10-9-7: DEVIATIONS:
If the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Village Board that any
provision or combination of provisions of this Chapter individually or
collectively render it not reasonably possible to install a functioning
installation and all other possibilities have been exhausted, the Village Board
may waive, reduce, or substitute from the requirements of this Chapter to
permit a functioning installation which will still be consistent with the
purpose and goals of this Chapter. (Ord. 98-494, 2-17-1998)
10-9-8: REMOVAL:
   A.   If the installation is maintained or operated in such a fashion to be
in violation of subsection
10-9-3E or F or any other provisions of this Chapter and the owner has failed
to eliminate the violation within thirty (30) days of the mailing of written
notice of violation to its last known address, the Village may remove such
antenna or tower at the owner's expense, and may use the posted bond to the
extent necessary with the owner responsible for any costs exceeding the
available bond.
   B.   Any installation that is not operated for a continuous period of six
(6) months shall be considered abandoned, provided that if there are two (2) or
more users of a single tower, the tower shall not be considered abandoned until
all users cease using the tower. The owner of such installation shall remove
same within thirty (30) days of the mailing of written notice of abandonment to
its last known address. If the owner fails to remove the installation within
the thirty (30) day period, then the Village may remove such installation at
the owner's expense, and may use the posted bond to the extent necessary with
the owner responsible for any costs exceeding the available bond. (Ord. 98-494,

10-10-7: Building And Site Design Standards
10-10-1: INTRODUCTION:
This chapter contains detailed land use and development recommendations for the
Route 173/I-94 interchange area, of the "gateway economic development area", as
shown on the Wadsworth zoning map as the gateway overlay zoning district. The
gateway economic development area is based on the intergovernmental agreement
between the village of Old Mill Creek, the village of Wadsworth, and Lake
County regarding the Route 173/I-94 interchange (the "Route 173
intergovernmental agreement").
The gateway plan is intended to create a cohesive entry, or gateway, into Lake
County and the adjacent communities. It promotes high quality economic
development that will provide desirable jobs, a strong diversified tax base and
convenient community services for local residents. The gateway plan establishes
land use, zoning and development standards. It also establishes criteria for
providing sewer, water and other infrastructure and services within the gateway
area. (Ord. 2007-723, 4-3-2007)
10-10-2: BOUNDARIES:
The boundary of the gateway economic development area is depicted as the
gateway overlay zoning district on the village of Wadsworth zoning map. (Ord.
2007-723, 4-3-2007)
10-10-3: ZONING:
All development applications for the allowed land uses of office/research,
office/light assembly, retail service and residential as shown on the gateway
economic development area proposed land use map for either a rezoning or a
subdivision approval will be done as a planned unit development based on the
village of Wadsworth planned unit development section of the Wadsworth zoning
ordinance.
Any development request will be in substantial conformance with the underlying
land use as depicted on the gateway economic development area proposed land use
map.
The development request will follow the following land use and development
standards as part of the planned unit development process. (Ord. 2007-723, 4-3-
2007)
10-10-4: DEVELOPMENT REVIEW:
As part of any processing of a development application with respect to the
development of any parcel within the gateway economic development area:
   A.   The village of Wadsworth, when receiving a development application (the
"approving party") shall ensure that the other parties to the intergovernmental
agreement (the "commenting parties") receive five (5) sets of the application
and all relevant plans relating to such application. The development
application shall be delivered to the commenting parties upon receipt by the
approving party but, at a minimum, no less than thirty (30) days prior to any
binding consideration by the approving party or, if a public hearing is
required in connection with the development application, no less than ten (10)
days before the commencement of such hearing. The development application shall
be delivered to the individuals identified in section 10 under the notice
provisions of the intergovernmental agreement.
   B.   The commenting parties shall have "agency status" for review of the
development application and shall be allowed to provide verbal and/or written
comments, within reason, throughout the decision making process of the
approving party.
   C.   The approving party shall require the developer to provide the
necessary on site and off site infrastructure to serve the proposed development
with sanitary sewer in a manner acceptable to the Lake County department of
public works. The Lake County department of public works may deem it necessary
for such infrastructure to be designed and sized to allow its extension and/or
expansion to serve all other properties within the subject area, to the use
level contemplated by the plan. Where oversizing is required, rights for
recapture may be provided to the extent permitted by Illinois law.
   D.   The approving party shall require the developer to provide the
necessary on site and off site infrastructure to serve the proposed development
with water supply in a manner acceptable to the Lake County department of
public works. The Lake County department of public works may deem it necessary
for such infrastructure to be designed and sized to allow its extension and/or
expansion to serve all or a portion of the other properties within the subject
area, to the use level contemplated by the plan. Where oversizing is required,
rights for recapture may be provided to the extent permitted by Illinois law.
Upon completion of installation of sanitary sewer and public water supply
infrastructure, to the satisfaction of the Lake County department of public
works, Lake County may require such infrastructure to be transferred to the
Lake County department of public works for ownership, operation and
maintenance. (Ord. 2007-723, 4-3-2007)

         c.   Rear: Twelve feet (12').
   D.   Residential Development Standards: The average range of residential
density for the entire area is anticipated to be between 0.2 and 0.3 units per
acre. In these areas, typical lots will range from two (2) to five (5) acres
with additional open space areas, which may include agriculture uses to
preserve the rural character of the area. In extremely unique circumstances
caused by environmental opportunities or constraints, two (2) acre lots may be
allowed with provisions that the remainder of the land subdivided is retained
for open space and/or agriculture uses. (Ord. 2007-723, 4-3-2007)
10-10-7: BUILDING AND SITE DESIGN STANDARDS:
   A.   Natural Resources And Open Space: Each development should protect and
enhance existing natural resource areas and provide open space areas in keeping
with the semirural nature of the surrounding communities. In addition to
natural open space areas, it may also be appropriate to provide formal open
space, such as a village square or building courtyards, as a focal point of the
development. All open space areas should feature amenities such as benches and
walkways. Buildings should be oriented to take advantage of open space views
and access. The protection of natural resources and provision of open space
should be addressed early in the planned unit development design process.
   B.   Storm Water Management: A unified storm water management system should
be designed for the entire development area. To the greatest extent possible,
storm water conveyance and storage should utilize the naturally occurring
drainage patterns and wetlands. Additional storage capacity should provide
through wet bottom detention basins. Detention basins with native wetland
vegetation are encouraged; basins with hard, manmade edges are discouraged. Dry
bottom detention basins should also be avoided. Storm water management should
be addressed early in the planned unit development design process and not as an
afterthought.
The storm water management system should be integrated into the open space and
pedestrian circulation plan. Incorporation of fountains to create water
features is encouraged. Buildings should be oriented to take advantage of views
of attractive water features and wetlands.
   C.   Circulation:
      1.   Automobile Circulation: The northeast quadrant will have a new
access point to Route 173, roughly centered between the existing Mill Creek
Road and the tollway. The northeast quadrant will have one primary access point
onto Mill Creek Road and a secondary access point primarily intended to serve
truck traffic to the office/light assembly/warehouse uses.
The southeast quadrant will have a new access point onto Route 173 directly
parallel to the northeast quadrant access point. The southeast quadrant will
also have one primary access point onto Mill Creek Road. A secondary access
point for truck traffic may also be permitted.
Roadways should be designed to allow circulation between various buildings and
uses within the entire subject area without exiting onto Route 173. Roadways
should be designed to minimize conflicts between automobile and truck traffic.
The primary access roads will be designed as boulevards for a distance of at
least two hundred (200) yards from the intersections with Route 173. The
central median should be planted with a variety of deciduous and evergreen
plantings to ensure year round foliage. Use of annuals is encouraged to ensure
maximum color during spring, summer and fall.
A well designed entrance monument is encouraged for both the north and south
primary access roads. The entrance monuments should be designed to complement
the building architecture and be consistent with the signage and landscaping
requirements established in this section.
      2.   Pedestrian Circulation: Walking within and between the various uses
contained within the overall development plan should be encouraged through the
provision of sidewalks along internal roadways and/or footpaths through the
open space element. The sidewalk and footpath network should be designed to
provide for future possible connections to adjacent developments.
   D.   Building Design: The architectural guidelines for buildings are
intended to require development that is compatible in scale and appearance with
the semirural, open space character of the Route 173 interchange. A uniform
design pallet of building materials, colors, and architectural design should be
applied throughout the entire subject area. Building elements and other uses,
such as vehicle parking, that are incompatible with the surrounding character,
should be screened from view from adjacent properties and roadways, including
I-94. These guidelines are not all-inclusive; it may be necessary to address
additional design elements during the review of individual project proposals.
   E.   Building Facades: All building facades that are visible from adjacent
major roadways should be designed to be aesthetically pleasant. This includes
the side and rear facades of buildings that are visible from Route 173, I-94,
and U.S. 41. Aesthetically pleasing design can be accomplished by employing the
same design elements to the side and rear facades that are often only given to
front facades. Visible building facades should have a defined base, middle and
top.
      1.   Building Massing: Big box architecture, whether on retail or office/
light assembly/warehouse buildings, is discouraged. Large wall expanses
(whether long or tall) should be eliminated through vertical and horizontal
articulation (changes so the wall is not a straight horizontal or vertical
line) and the use of architectural projections, such as porticoes and recesses.
Large wall expanses can also be broken through the use of pilasters, columns,
canopies, and windows. Changes in building heights and rooflines can also be
utilized to soften the visual impacts of long building walls. Changes in facade
materials and colors can improve the appearance of large buildings, but, alone,
these changes are not sufficient to eliminate the visual impacts of large wall
expanses.
      2.   Building Height: Building heights should gradually transition from
low buildings to tall buildings. Where necessary, this transition can occur
within a single building by designing the building with a larger, single-story
base and a taller (multi-story or high ceilinged warehouse) center.
      3.   Building Entrances And Windows: Building entrances should allow for
easy access from parking areas and public open space. Primary building
entrances should be easily identifiable through the use of design elements such
as canopies, porticoes, recesses, or archways. Building doors and windows
should be pedestrian scaled.
In addition to providing natural lighting for occupants, windows should be
utilized to soften building appearances, displaying merchandise and inviting
customers into buildings. Windows should be appropriately sized, arranged, and
designed to enhance the overall appearance of the building. Multipaned windows,
windows with a vertical orientation and windows with a well defined frame or
sill are preferred.
      4.   Facade Materials And Colors: In order to complement the semirural,
open space character of the Route 173 interchange area, the use of natural
building materials and colors is encouraged. Desirable building materials
include brick, terra cotta and natural stone, such as limestone and river
stone. The exclusive use of synthetic materials, such as EIFS/drivit and
precast concrete is discouraged.
Building colors should be natural, earth tones. Dark tones should be utilized
at building base and lighter tones for upper levels. The color selection for
architectural elements such as roofs, awnings, cornices, eaves and sills should
complement the main building color.
      5.   Roof Styles And Materials: Roof styles and variations can add visual
interest to all buildings, but should remain consistent with the overall
building design. Buildings should be designed with a fascia and cornices that
provide a transition between the wall and roof. Flat rooflines are discouraged.
Arched and pitched roofs and roof features such as dormers and cupolas are
encouraged.
      6.   Mechanical And Service Area Screening: All rooftop mechanical
equipment should be visually screened from sight from all public access areas
and adjacent to properties and roadways. Ground level mechanical equipment,
trash collection and loading areas should be appropriately screened from view
from all public access areas and adjacent properties and roadways.
   F.   Lighting Standards: Lighting should be provided to ensure the safety
and security of building occupants and customers. A uniform lighting plan,
including buildings and pole lights, should be designed for the entire subject
area. Lighting should be designed and scaled to create an attractive, friendly
pedestrian environment. Pathways should be lit with low bollard lights.
Lighting intensity should be differentiated based on the location and uses. All
light fixtures should be shielded. All lighting should be designed to minimize
glare on adjacent properties.
   G.   Parking: Parking spaces should be provided for each building in
accordance with the off street parking standards established in the Lake County
unified development ordinances as now in effect or modified in the future.
Parking lots should be located to the side and rear of buildings, when
possible. Parking is not allowed in the required front/corner building
setbacks. Shared parking is encouraged. Parking lots should provide well
defined walkways that minimize pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.
Parking should be clustered in sections separated by building and landscape
islands. Landscape islands should be sufficient in area to accommodate a
variety of plant species. Parking lot landscaping that balances deciduous and
evergreen plantings to ensure year round foliage is encouraged. Parking lots
should also have adequate perimeter landscaping to screen them from adjacent
properties and roadways.
   H.   Outdoor Storage: Outdoor storage is discouraged. All storage of
materials, equipment, and commercial vehicles should occur within approved
structures designed for that purpose.
   I.   Signage Standards: Signage should meet all standards provided in the
Lake County unified development ordinance, as now in effect or in the village
of Wadsworth zoning ordinance, as amended. Whichever ordinance is more
restrictive will prevail.
      1.   Sign Types: Each building tenant should only be allowed one wall
sign. Corner tenants may have a sign on each facade facing the street. The sign
should be mounted on the wall or on an awning or other entrance feature. Wall
signs should not extend above the roofline (eave).
Freestanding signs should be of a monument type. Pole signs are discouraged.
Freestanding signs should emphasize horizontal rather than vertical massing.
The surface of monument signs should contain visible indentations or see
through spaces of appropriate dimensions at appropriate intervals to avoid
overt massing, where applicable. Landscaping should be provided around the base
of freestanding signs.
      2.   Signage Composition: Softer, subtler alternatives to prominent
corporate logos are preferred. For multi-tenant buildings and developments,
consistent lettering, colors and sign designs should be used on all wall signs
and monument signs.
The sign text should consist of no more than two (2) fonts or sizes.
Italicized, bold and plain text should not be mixed. The use of images,
pictures and logos should be minimized, but, if used, should be simplified in
appearance and integrated into the site's overall architectural and color
schemes. Solid lettering is preferred over highlighted or accented lettering.
      3.   Signage Colors: The sign and any background should together consist
of no more than two (2) colors or shades of the same color. The signage color
scheme should match or complement the color scheme of the building. Primary,
white and "Day-Glo" colors should be avoided.
      4.   Signage Materials: Polished, glossy, shiny, or reflective sign
surfaces are discouraged. Matte, natural, brushed, patina like or burnished
surfaces are preferred. Plastic or glass surfaces are discouraged. Wood, stone,
brick, masonry or metal materials are preferred.
      5.   Signage Lighting: Natural (soft halogen or incandescent) lighting is
preferred. Overbright or fluorescent lighting should be avoided. Internal
illumination and protruding overhead lights or lamps should be avoided.
Lighting devices should be hidden or integrated into architectural features or
landscaping. Lighting should be focused and only so bright as to effectively
illuminate the sign surface. For mounted letters, backlighting is preferred.
For freestanding signs, ground based external lighting is preferred, subject to
the above guidelines. Ground based light surfaces should be concealed within
landscaping.
   J.   Landscaping And Screening: Landscaping and screening should meet all
standards provided in the Lake County unified development ordinance, as now in
effect or amended in the future. The guidelines presented below represent
additional guidelines. The guidelines are not all-inclusive; future discussions
may elicit additional requirements for landscaping based on new concerns or
changing conditions.
All developments should contain adequate exterior buffer yards that are bermed
and landscaped so as to preclude views of buildings, loading areas, truck
parking lots and other undesirable views from adjacent uses, properties and
roadways. For screening purposes, fences may be used in conjunction with berms
and landscaping.
Desirable views of office and retail buildings should be preserved from
adjacent roadways and properties with compatible uses. Partial views of well
designed office/light assembly/warehouse building front facades as well as side
and rear facades that achieve aesthetically pleasing three hundred sixty degree
(360°) design, may be permissible from adjacent roadways and properties with
compatible uses.
Loading docks and truck parking areas should be screened from view from all
public (customer) access areas, including public access areas on the same
property or development. In order to minimize undesirable views, locating
loading docks and truck parking area back to back between adjacent office/light
assembly/warehouse buildings is encouraged.
The view of parking lots should be partially obscured or softened through
landscaping, staggered landscaped berms or preserved natural vegetation.
Extensive area of mowed or manicured turf grass should be avoided.
Existing woodlands should be preserved and enhanced. Trees should be planted in
random clusters, rather than straight rows. Like species should be grouped only
to maintain continuity. Formal landscaping should be limited to small areas.
Landscape areas should incorporate a complementary mix of deciduous and
evergreen species, while emphasizing deciduous species.
Cluster varieties of species sizes (canopies interspersed with understories,
bushes and ground cover). Emphasize hardy native species (limit predominance of
nonnative or ornamental species). Minimize the use of formal hedges.
Incorporate ground cover and/or bushes into landscaping, while limiting the
predominance of ground cover and/or bushes.
Landscaping should maximize seasonal colors by including perennial flowers and
opportunities for planting annual flowers that bloom in spring, summer and
fall.
Earthen berms should undulate naturally and have varying heights and setbacks.
Berms should be landscaped with a variety of plant species, as otherwise
required in these landscaping guidelines. Extensive areas of turf grass on
berms should be avoided.
At intersections, provide soft massings of landscaping to complement signage
and to provide a focal point while not impairing visibility of buildings nor
impairing traffic safety. Bike and pedestrian pathways should be integrated
into landscaping to soften visibility, separate from vehicle traffic, and
promote safety.
   K.   Supplemental Performance Standards; Noise: All on site equipment should
operate in accordance with the Illinois environmental protection agency's noise
regulations (title 35, subtitle H, chapter 1 of the Illinois administrative
code) as now in effect or the village of Wadsworth noise standards. (Ord. 2007-
723, 4-3-2007)

operating condition within ninety (90) days.
AMBIENT SOUND: The all encompassing sound at a given location, usually a
composite of sounds from many sources near and far. For the purpose of this
chapter, the "ambient sound level" shall mean the quiescent background level,
that is, the quietest of ten (10) 10-second average sound levels measured when
there are no nearby or distinctly audible sound sources (e.g., dogs or jets).
Daytime ambient measurements should be made during midmorning, weekday hours
while nighttime measurements should be made after twelve o'clock (12:00)
midnight.
APPLICANT: The owner, who is in the process of submitting or has submitted an
application to install a wind energy system project in the village of
Wadsworth.
BUILDING MOUNTED WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS (BWES): Wind energy systems that are
structurally attached either onto the roof, to the side of a building, or

scarcity, function and/or value.
HORIZONTAL AXIS WIND TURBINE (HAWT): This is the most typical type of turbine
used. They have the main rotor shaft and generator at the top of the tower, and
must be pointed into the wind. Small turbines are pointed by a simple wind
vane, while large turbines generally use a wind sensor coupled with a
servomotor. Most have a gearbox, which turns the slow rotation of the blades
into a quicker rotation that is more suitable to drive an electrical generator.
IDNR: The Illinois state department of natural resources.
LARGE WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS (LWES): Wind energy systems with turbine towers and
fully extended blades measuring taller than one hundred seventy five feet
(175') from the ground. LWES include one or more wind turbines, electronic
conversion and distribution systems. They typically produce energy to be sold
commercially and have a nameplate capacity of seven hundred fifty (750) kW to
2.5 MW.
LOW FREQUENCY SOUND: Sound with frequencies below one hundred (100) Hz,
including audible sound and infrasound, as opposed to broadband which has sound
frequencies above one hundred (100) Hz. Infrasound has frequencies below twenty
(20) Hz, which if sufficiently intense, can be perceived by many individuals,
and must be measured by a sound level meter using the C-weighted system.
MET TOWER: A meteorological tower with an anemometer, used for the measurement
of wind speed.
NACELLE: The part containing the shaft, gearbox, and generator in a typical
horizontal axis turbine.

one kW to one hundred (100) kW in nameplate wattage.
SOUND: A disturbance or oscillation that propagates outwardly as acoustic waves
through the air.
SOUND FREQUENCY: The number of oscillations per second expressed in hertz (Hz).
How we perceive sound is partly dependant on frequency. High frequency sound
has more oscillations per second, whereas low frequency sound has fewer.
   A.   Audible Or Tonal Sound: Sound frequencies between twenty (20) and
twenty thousand (20,000) Hz. With WES, this may include mechanical sounds from
rotating machinery experienced as "hum" or "pitch" occurring at distinct
frequencies.
   B.   Broadband: A wide range of frequencies above one hundred (100) Hz. With
WES, the aerodynamics from the displacement of air from the turning blades of a
wind turbine creates a "swishing" or "whooshing" sensation.

including the highest reach of the blades.
TOWER: A tall structure, mounted in the ground, on which a wind turbine is
mounted.
TURBINE: The parts of a wind energy facility including the blades, nacelle and
tail.
TURBINE HEIGHT: The distance from the structure's average ground elevation to
the highest point of the wind turbine, including the highest reach of the
blades.
VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE (VAWT): A small scale wind turbine, in which the
main rotor shaft is arranged vertically creating an "egg beater" appearance.
The generator and gearbox are located near the ground so the tower does not
have to support it and it is more accessible for maintenance.
WATT (Symbol: W): A derived unit of power in the international system of units
(SI). It measures rate of energy conversion. One watt is equivalent to one
joule (J) of energy per second. The kilowatt (symbol: kW) is equal to one
thousand (1,000) watts. The megawatt (symbol:   MW) is equal to one million
(1,000,000) watts.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEM (WES): A wind energy production, conversion and distribution
system consisting of a wind turbine, tower, and associated electronics
equipment. In other publications this is known as wind energy conversion system
(WECS).

harmless the village of Wadsworth and their officials from and against any and
all claims, demands, losses, suits, causes of action, damages, injuries, costs,
expenses and liabilities whatsoever including attorney fees arising out of the
acts or omissions of the owner concerning the operation of the WES project
without limitation, whether said liability is premised on contract or on tort.
(Ord. 2010-816, 5-18-2010)
10-12-5: SOUND LEVEL LIMITATIONS FOR BWES AND SWES:
   A.   Average Sound Level: The average sound level for wind facilities shall
not exceed fifty (50) dBA during the daytime and forty (40) dBA during the
nighttime at any point within neighboring, residentially zoned or used
property. The average sound level from wind facilities shall not exceed sixty
five (65) dBA on neighboring industrial properties and sixty (60) dBA on other
neighboring nonresidential properties at any time of day. Measurements can be
taken at any location on nonparticipating properties and must account for
ambient sound contributions.
   B.   Operation Of WES With Average Sound Level More Than Five dBA Above
Level: No WES shall operate with an average sound level more than five (5) dBA
above the nonoperational ambient level, as measured within one hundred feet
(100') of any neighboring residential dwelling.
   C.   Limitation Of Low Frequency Sound: To limit the level of low frequency
sound, the average C-weighted sound level during facility operation shall not
exceed the A-weighted ambient sound level by more than twenty (20) dB.
   D.   Sound Level Measurement:
      1.   Sound Measurement Worksheet: The wind energy facilities sound
measurement worksheet is intended to determine the average sound level (i.e.,
source sound level) from operating wind energy facilities by correcting for the
ambient sound levels. This measurement will determine whether the sound exceeds
the limits indicated in this section.
      2.   Sound Level Meters: Sound level meters (SLM) must meet the type 2
grade or better per the latest revision of ANSI S1.4 "American National
Standard Specification For Sound Level Meters" and must have an integrating
feature that meets ANSI S1.43 "American National Standard Specifications For
Integration Averaging Sound Level Meters".
      3.   Basis Of Procedures: The procedures outlined herein are based in
essences on applicable portions of ANSI S12.9 "American National Standard
Quantities And Procedures For Description And Measurement Of Environmental
Sound" and part 910 of title 35: environmental protection, subtitle H: noise,
chapter 1: Illinois pollution control board.
      4.   Frequency Measurement:
         a.   The A-weighted scale is most often utilized for the measurement
of tonal or audible sound levels. These are sounds that range from twenty (20)
to twenty thousand (20,000) Hz and that the human ear can typically hear.
         b.   The C-weighted scale is utilized especially for measurement of
low frequency sound, i.e., more bass tones or infrasound, which may or may not
be audible to the human ear. Low frequency sounds can travel farther and may be
enhanced in different locations such as in buildings.
      5.   Instrumentation Setup:
         a.   Ensure the battery is in good condition.
         b.   Measurements may be taken at any position on a nonparticipating

            (2)   Twenty five feet (25') of a large reflective surface (e.g.,
shed, building, etc.); or
            (3)   Fifty feet (50') of a large reflective surface if the sound
is tonal in nature.
         c.   A tripod for the microphone or SLM is required if the sound is
high pitched. If the sound is low frequency in nature, a handheld meter is
acceptable as long as the arm is extended.
         d.   The microphone on the SLM must be aimed toward the noise source
and oriented at an angle recommended by the manufacturer (usually 45 to 70
degrees off the ground). (Ord. 2010-816, 5-18-2010)

The procedure established by this Chapter shall apply to the approval of a
subdivision of lands. (Ord. 96-445, 7-2-1996)
11-4-2: LAND PLANNING CONFERENCE:
The purpose of the land planning conference is to familiarize the subdivider
with procedural and regulatory provisions of Wadsworth ordinances and other
applicable regulations to which a development may be subject, prior to the
expenditure of large sums of money. The land planning conference shall be
scheduled with representatives from the Village Board, the Plan Commission, the
Village Planner, the Village Engineer and, where a change in zoning is
required, a representative from the Zoning Board of Appeals. It is recommended
that the subdivider be represented by his land planner and engineer. The land
planning conference shall be scheduled after deposit of any fees required by
the Village, in accordance with Section
1-7-1 of this Code. The land planning conference shall include a discussion of
the procedures for approval of a subdivision plat, as well as the existing and/
or proposed zoning and other applicable regulations. The conference shall also
include consideration of the Comprehensive Plan, general layout of the site,
including roads, road improvements, drainage, sewerage, fire protection, park
sites, and other relevant matters. The subdivider may, at his option, elect to
submit a sketch plan at the land planning conference. The purpose of a sketch
plan is to permit the subdivider to receive advice and comments on the general
design of his proposed subdivision. Although the sketch plan is optional, the
Village encourages the submittal of sketch plans. Only a subdivider who is
thoroughly familiar with all Village requirements and procedures affecting the
subdivision of land should consider proceeding directly to the preliminary plat
stage without submitting a sketch plan. It is the responsibility of the
subdivider to:
   A.   Become familiar with the Zoning Ordinance 1 , the Subdivision Control
Ordinance codified in this Title, engineering specifications, and other
ordinances or controls relating to the subdivision and improvement of land.
   B.   Investigate the adequacy of existing schools, open space, recreation
areas, and other public facilities to serve the proposed subdivision.
   C.   Review the relationship of the proposed subdivision with existing
street systems and the governing street or highway safety and construction
standards. Where the property fronts on a State or County road, investigate the
State and County regulations controlling access, as necessary.
   D.   Investigate the Lake County standards for sewage disposal and water
supply and the standards of the public utility companies.
   E.   Investigate the requirements of the Lake County Stormwater Management
Commission. (Ord. 96-445, 7-2-1996)

for a reasonable period of time. This review may be continued to subsequent
meetings of the Plan Commission. The Plan Commission shall approve or
disapprove the application for preliminary approval within ninety (90) days, or
such longer time permitted by statute, from the date of the application or the
filing by the subdivider of the last item of required supporting data,
whichever date is later, unless such time is extended by mutual consent. If
such plat is disapproved, then within said ninety (90) days the Plan Commission
shall furnish to the subdivider in a written statement setting forth the
reasons for disapproval and specifying with particularity the aspects in which
the proposed plat fails to conform to the ordinances.
      2.   The Plan Commission shall forward all information filed by the

Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing on such application, in
conformance with the provisions of the Zoning Title.
      4.   The Plan Commission shall submit its recommendation in writing to
the Planning, Zoning, and Plats Committee indicating approval of the
application, approval subject to additional conditions and modifications, or
denial of the application. This recommendation shall specify the reasons for
the recommendations of the Plan Commission. A copy of such recommendation,
which may include the recommendations of the Village Planner and Village
Engineer, shall be sent to the subdivider.

preliminary plat, approve it subject to conditions and modifications, deny it,
or refer the application back to the Plan Commission for further consideration
and study. If such plat is approved by the Plan Commission, the Village Board
shall accept or reject the plat within thirty (30) days after its next
regularly scheduled meeting following the action of the Plan Commission.
Preliminary approval shall not qualify a plat for recording.
      1.   Approval of the preliminary plat constitutes approval of the layout
of the streets, lots, blocks, and land uses, and authorizes the subdivider to
prepare the detailed engineering drawings and final plat.
      2.   If the Village Board of Trustees approves the preliminary plat
subject to conditions and modifications, such approval shall be valid only when
the subdivider files with the Village Board of Trustees written consent to such

11-4-7: DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS AND SCHOOL SITES OR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU
THEREOF:
   A.   School Payment:
      1.   As a condition of approval for any final plat of subdivision of any
block, lot, or sublot or any part thereof, or any piece or parcel of land, or
of a final plat for a planned unit development, or as a condition of issuance
of a building permit for any dwelling unit, each subdivider or permittee shall
be required to make payments to the Village for the benefit of the elementary
school and high school districts within which the property shall be located.
These funds are intended to provide the school district with the necessary
funds to secure school sites, and for such other purposes as permitted by law,
to provide adequate schooling for the anticipated pupils who will live within
each dwelling unit. The funds shall be paid at the time of final plat approval,
or, at the election of the subdivider, with the consent of the Village Board,
shall be paid at the time of building permit issuance for each dwelling unit.
In all other circumstances, the payment shall be made prior to issuance of a
building permit. No payment shall be required for any building permit for any
dwelling unit within a subdivision, if payment was made to the district at the
time of subdivision approval, in accordance with the requirements existing at
the time of said subdivision approval. No payment shall be required for any
building permit for any dwelling unit within a subdivision, if payment was made
to the district on or before the date of adoption hereof, pursuant to a written
agreement entered into prior to the date of adoption hereof for a subdivision,
which received final plat approval prior to the date of adoption hereof.
The amount of the payment shall be determined by the respective school
district, using generally accepted formulas, provided that the Village Board
has approved the amount ascertained by the respective district, and provided
that the district has executed the approved indemnification agreement. In the
event that the property upon which the dwelling unit is to be located falls
within two (2) school districts for the same level of schooling, such as the
same two (2) elementary school districts, the district which has the greater
portion of the property upon which the dwelling unit shall be located shall
receive the funds.
All funds shall be paid to the Village. The Village will thereafter remit the
funds on a quarterly basis, less an administrative processing charge of ten
percent (10%) up to a maximum of thirty dollars ($30.00) for each received
payment.
      2.   In order to qualify for the contribution, the respective school
district must execute the agreement substantially in the form as follows and
submit and have approved the contribution formula and amounts:
   AGREEMENT
   In exchange for the mutual obligations and considerations contained herein,
the Village of Wadsworth (hereinafter "Village") and            School District
#      (hereinafter "District") understand and agree as follows:
I.   The Village has enacted an ordinance, which requires payments to be made
to the Village for the benefit of the District for certain dwelling units to be
constructed within the Village. These funds, which will be received by the
Village and thereafter remitted to the District, less a ten per cent
administrative processing charge up to a maximum of $30.00 for each received
payment, shall be used for obtaining school sites and for such other purposes
as are permitted by law.
II.   The District will periodically establish the amount of payment per
dwelling unit, using generally accepted formulae, and submit the payment amount
determination to the Village for review and approval.
III.   The Village, upon receipt, shall review the proposed payment schedule.
If it is satisfactory, the Village will approve it, and thereafter require the
approved payments as a condition of final subdivision or planned unit
development approval, or issuance of a building permit. No payment shall be
required if a payment was already made to the District when the property was
originally subdivided.
IV.   The District shall indemnify and hold harmless the Village from any and
all claims, liability, losses, or damages the Village may suffer as a result of
the adoption or enforcement of Village ordinances pertaining to any such
contribution to the District, or in any way relating thereto, and any and all
payments made pursuant thereto.
V.   Should the Village, for the purposes of resisting, or compromising any
claims or demands arising out of the subject matter with respect to which
indemnification is provided by this agreement, or for the purposes of enforcing
this agreement, incur any expenses, attorney fees or court costs, the District
shall promptly reimburse the Village for any such expenses, attorney fees, or
court costs upon written demand by the Village.
VI.   This agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their successors
and assigns.
VII.   This agreement shall be in full force and effect for forty years.

(Ord. 99-540, 12-21-1999)
   B.   Park And Recreation Payment: As a condition of approval of a final plat
of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each
subdivider shall be required to dedicate land for park and recreational
purposes, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a
combination of both, at the option of the Village, in accordance with the
following criteria and formula:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total
requirement shall be five and one-half (5.5) acres of land per one thousand
(1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following
classifications:
 
TYPES OF RECREATION FACILITY     MINIMUM SIZE   MINIMUM ACRES PER 1,000 PEOPLE
Play lot                         8,000 sq. ft.  Not applicable
Neighborhood playground          5 acres        1.25
Neighborhood park                3.5 acres      1.0
District-wide park or play field 4 to 30 acres  1.25
Community-wide recreation park   12 to 30 acres 2.0
Total                                          5.5 acres of park per 1,000
                                                people
 
      2.   Location: The Comprehensive Park and Recreation Plan and/or the
"Standards by Types of Recreation and Park Areas" as adopted by the Village
shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A park site adjoining all
elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres shall be considered a
requirement. A central location which will serve equally the entire development
is most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout
the development according to established standards for park area distances.
      3.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When a
subdivider provides within the subdivision open space for recreation areas and
facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational services. Depending on the size of the development a portion of
the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may
at the option of the Village Board be provided in the form of "private" open
space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be
determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the
general area.
      4.   Private Open Spaces: In general, a substitution of private open
space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of
improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including
equipment by the subdivider as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such
areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved
by the Village, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas,
the subdivider must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal
documents. Private "swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When an
adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to
compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the
subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be
given.
      5.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites: Where
the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or
when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes,
the Village shall require the Subdivider to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and
recreation land dedication shall be used solely for the acquisition of or
maintenance of park and recreation land.
      6.   Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and
recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present "fair
market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the Village is sixty
thousand dollars ($60,000.00) per acre and such figure shall be used in making
any calculation herein unless the subdivider files a written objection thereto.
In the event of any such objection the subdivider shall submit an appraisal
showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the area of his
development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair
market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board
based upon such information submitted by the subdivider and from other sources.
      7.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There will be
situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of
land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
         a.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land
that would have been required to be dedicated.
         b.   A major part of the local park or recreation site has already
been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development
to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
      8.   Cash Payments: Cash payments in lieu of land dedications shall be
paid per dwelling unit at the time of issuance of building permits.
      9.   Density Table: The following table of population density is
generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size
for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required
dedications of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a
written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider:

      10.   Demographic Study: In the event a subdivider files a written
objection to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population listed herein, he shall
submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population
from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be
made by the Village Board based upon such demographic information submitted by
the subdivider and from other sources. It is recognized that population
density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the
specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.
   C.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the Comprehensive Plan or the
standards of the Village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land
in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the subdivider is
required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider's contribution
shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the Village or other public body
designated by the Village, provided that such acquisition is made within one
year from the date of approval of the final plat.
   D.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned
unit development is less than forty (40) acres, parks and public open space,
where possible, shall be combined with dedications from adjoining developments
in order to produce usable recreation areas without hardship on a particular
subdivider, or the Village Board may elect to accept a cash equivalent.
   E.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land.
   F.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed
drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or
acceptable provision made therefor. (Ord. 96-445, 7-2-1996)

12-1-2: Purpose
12-1-1: TITLE:
This Title shall be known, cited and referred to as the WADSWORTH LANDSCAPE
ORDINANCE. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)
12-1-2: PURPOSE:
The natural landscape of the Wadsworth area is one of the Village's most valued
assets. It is a unique combination of natural and manmade features adapted
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to an agrarian way of life.
The second half of the twentieth century has seen the beginning of a process of
development and change from a farm community to a low density suburban
community. It is the intent of this Title to protect and preserve those
features of the natural and agrarian landscape which contribute to the beauty
and charm of this Village setting and to regulate new development so that the
benefits of a well-landscaped environment are extended to all present and
future residents of the Village. Specifically this Title is adopted for the
following purposes:
   A.   To protect existing trees and forests and to secure for the residents
of Wadsworth the environmental and aesthetic benefits that such trees and
forests provide and to require the replacement of such trees and forests which
cannot as a practical matter be preserved.
   B.   To further implement the Wadsworth subdivision regulations 1  by
establishing standards for the landscaping of new subdivisions and planned unit
developments.
   C.   To further implement the natural resource protection and scenic
corridor provisions of the Wadsworth Zoning Ordinance 2  by establishing
standards for the landscaping of such areas.
   D.   To establish standards and regulations for the landscaping of business
and industries.
   E.   To protect the natural habitat of animal species indigenous to
Wadsworth environments.
   F.   To establish standards and regulations for preparation of landscape
plans, and the installation and maintenance of plant materials.
   G.   To provide for the removal of diseased or unsafe trees and other plant
materials, which contribute to unsafe or unhealthy environmental conditions.
   H.   To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience,
and general welfare of the people of Wadsworth. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)

Notes
1 1. See Title 10 of this Code.
12-4-3: PRIOR DESTRUCTION OR REMOVAL:
If during the course of the review of an application for an annexation to or a
development within the Village, it shall be determined that mature trees, or
mature or young woodlands, have been cut or relocated from the site prior to
the application for an annexation or a development, the net result of which
would be to frustrate or interfere with the application of a site capacity
analysis required under Section
10-5-3 of this Code, then, in that event, the Village shall treat the
annexation or development as if the trees were still existing on the site, and
require all appropriate site capacity calculations to be so applied. In
addition, as a condition of approval of the annexation or development, the
Village shall require that the developer replenish the site with like species
which aggregate to the full sum of the diameter of the trees which have been
removed. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)
12-4-4: TREE REPLACEMENT STANDARDS:
   A.   Standard: When a permit is issued to remove tree(s), the permittee
shall be required to plant replacement trees for every tree removed after the
fifth tree for individual home sites and for every tree removed after the third
tree for other sites. The Village Forester may reduce the required amount of
replacement trees if he determines that strict compliance with this requirement
is impossible or not reasonably practical and a reduced amount of replanting
would still fulfill the purpose and intent of this Title. Tree replacements
will be of like species or other species approved by the Village Forester and
the number and size of which shall be in accordance with the following table:
Tree Removed In Young Woodlands Replacement Trees
Tree Removed In Young Woodlands Replacement Trees
1–4" to 6", DBH               1–3" caliper
1–Over 6", DBH                1–4" caliper or 2–3" caliper

shall be no charge for the permit. Applications for permits may be obtained
from the Village Forester. Prior to the issuance of a permit for tree removal,
the Village Forester shall conduct an on-site inspection to determine whether
or not the removal conforms to the criteria of this Title. The permit shall be
issued if any one of the following conditions is present:
   A.   It is reasonably necessary to remove trees which pose a safety hazard
to pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or threatens to cause disruption of public
service.

forestry practices, for the tree to be removed.
   E.   It is reasonably necessary to remove the trees in order to construct
proposed improvements, which are consistent with the zoning of the property
upon which the tree is located, and there is no reasonable alternative
available on the site.
   F.   In order to comply with any other applicable Village ordinance
provisions, it is necessary for the trees to be cut or relocated. (Ord. 97-473,
4-1-1997)

LANDSCAPE STANDARDS
SECTION:
12-5-1: Scope
12-5-2: Natural Resource Protection Areas
12-5-3: Scenic Corridor Areas
12-5-4: Subdivisions
12-5-5: Site Improvements - Residential
12-5-6: Site Improvements - Nonresidential
12-5-1: SCOPE:
This chapter sets forth the standards for landscaping subdivisions, individual
businesses, and other uses falling within the scope of regulation of this
title. The standards and regulations of this chapter are further divided into
five (5) separate sets of standards and regulations covering the landscaping of
natural resource protection areas, scenic corridor areas, subdivisions, site
improvements, and buffers and required yards; any new subdivision or any
business, industry or other development required to be landscaped which
contains any or all of these features shall be landscaped so that the
requirement for each feature present thereon is met and a unified design is
prepared for the entire subdivision or site. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)
12-5-2: NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION AREAS:
   A.   Natural resource protection areas, as defined and established in titles
10 and 11 of this code, shall be maintained in a manner consistent with the
preservation of the resource. The landscape treatment shall be the minimum
treatment required to repair any damage to the resource incidental to the
development of the lot, to maintain the resource in an unchanged and
nonimpacted condition, and to allow appropriate future open space use of the
resource protection area consistent with the requirement for the protection and
preservation of the resource.
   B.   The area of protection of such resource shall be deleted from the area
of the lot for purposes of determining the landscaping requirements of the
balance of the lot. The owner shall submit to the village as part of the
landscape plan a resource protection plan indicating the landscape treatment of
all required resource protection areas 1 .
   C.   The resource protection measures required by all agencies having
jurisdiction over the site, other than the village, shall be adhered to and
shall form the basis for the resource protection plan for those resources which
fall within the jurisdiction of outside agencies. In particular, any
requirements of the U.S. army corps of engineers regarding wetlands and the
Lake County stormwater management agency regarding detention facilities shall
be complied with. The regulations and approvals of such agencies shall not
limit the village in requiring adequate resource protection as provided in
title 10 of this code and this title. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)
 
Notes
1 1. See subsections
  10-5-3E and F of this code and chapter 6 of this title.
12-5-3: SCENIC CORRIDOR AREAS:
The scenic corridor overlay district regulations of the Wadsworth zoning
ordinance 1  are intended to help preserve the natural scenic qualities of the
Wadsworth area. Of particular interest are the open fields, wetlands and stands
of hardwood forests. The wetlands and forest are protected natural resource
features under subsection
10-5-3E of this code. The standards for landscaping applicable to scenic
corridors require first the protection of natural resources. Beyond this the
owner has a choice in the preservation and continuation of other natural and
manmade environments such as old fields, farm fields, pastures and commercial
tree plantings of various kinds. Last, there are requirements for the landscape
improvements to be installed in those portions of the scenic corridors which
are clearly deficient in scenic resources of all types.
   A.   Protected Natural Resources: Natural resources required to be protected
under the Wadsworth zoning ordinance 2  shall be protected in scenic corridors.
Even though the Wadsworth zoning ordinance 3  provides that a portion of a
resource may be developed for other use, all parts of the resource lying within
a scenic corridor shall be protected. While some minimal landscape improvements
may be needed to stabilize or better protect the resource, no further
landscaping and no additional tree planting is required. The natural resources
required to be protected are:
      1.   Mature woodlands;
      2.   Young woodlands;
      3.   Wetlands;
      4.   Flood plains;
      5.   Steep slopes;
      6.   Lakes;
      7.   Ponds;
      8.   Lake shorelines;
      9.   Pond shorelines; and
      10.   Drainageways.
   B.   Other Natural Resources:
      1.   Old Fields: Old field environments in which the emergent trees are
at least six feet (6') in height may be preserved as part of a scenic corridor
and no further landscaping is required for such old field areas.
      2.   Farm Fields And Pastures: Farm fields and pastures may be retained
as part of a scenic corridor provided they adjoin or are part of a larger field
or pastures which are continued and maintained as part of the development.
      3.   Commercial Tree Plantings: Commercial plantings may be continued in
scenic corridors. Orchards may be retained as long as they are operated or they
may be abandoned without further landscaping required. Nurseries may be
retained as long as they are operated. Upon the cessation of operation, such
areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the standards of subsection C of
this Section. Other tree farms may be retained. At the time any such tree farm
is harvested, the scenic corridor portion shall be landscaped in accordance
with the following regulations.
   C.   Other Areas: All other areas within the scenic corridor, exclusive of
the protected natural resources and other natural resources, retained as part
of the landscape plan shall be landscaped in accordance with the following
standards:
      1.   Farm fields (field crop areas) which are abandoned along with all
disturbed areas shall be seeded or sodded. Pastures and other old fields which
are not retained as part of the landscape plan as other natural resources may
be left in a natural state, subject to the required tree planting.
      2.   Trees shall be planted within the scenic corridor area exclusive of
any conservation areas as provided in subsections A and B of this Section, in
accordance with the following standards:
Canopy trees (BB - 3 inches)     4/10,000 square feet
Ornamental trees (BB - 2 inches) 2/10,000 square feet
Shrubs (BB - 2 foot height)      5/10,000 square feet
Or
Canopy trees (BB - 3 inches)     1/10,000 square feet
Canopy trees (BR - 1 inch)       8/10,000 square feet
Ornamental trees (BB - 2 inches) 1/10,000 square feet
Ornamental trees (BR - 1 inch)   2/10,000 square feet
Shrubs (CTR - 1 gallon)          20/10,000 square feet
 
      3.   Earth berms may be constructed within the scenic corridor areas
outside any areas reserved for the protection of natural resources. Such berms
shall have fore and back slopes of no greater pitch than three to one (3:1).
Berms shall be seeded or sodded and planted in accordance with the above
standards.
      4.   Scenic corridor areas may be reforested in accordance with the
standards and regulations of Section
10-4-3 of this Code.
   D.   Credit For Existing Trees: Existing trees and trees saved from
orchards, nurseries and other commercial tree plantations may be substituted
for new trees required as replacement trees or for new trees as otherwise
required by this Title. Credit shall be given on a one-to-one (1:1) basis,
provided the existing trees are equal to or greater in size than those required
by ordinance and that the species is suitable for the intended purpose.
   E.   Signs: In addition to the standards and regulations of Section
10-5-8 of this Code, the following regulations shall govern the placement of
signs in all scenic corridors:

      2.   The areas surrounding signs permitted in scenic corridors for a
distance of twenty feet (20') in all directions shall be landscaped. Such
landscaping shall be designed to blend with the surrounding natural environment
and shall completely screen any exposed foundations or other supporting
structural members of the sign.
   F.   Fencing: Only the following types of fencing are permitted within a
scenic corridor:
      1.   Farm fencing to enclose a farming activity within the scenic
corridor area.
      2.   Open security fencing (woven steel chainlink) when required to
protect a utility installation within the scenic corridor.
      3.   Right-of-way fencing where installed by governmental agencies to
enclose their limited access right of way.
   G.   Prohibitions: No ornamental buildings, structures, recreation
facilities, play equipment, or ornamental devices of any kind may be placed in
a scenic corridor. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)

12-8-2: Guarantees
12-8-1: MAINTENANCE:
For any subdivision, planned unit development or other development for which
landscaping is required under this Title, the owner or developer is encouraged
to prepare and implement a comprehensive landscape maintenance program. Such
program should include, as a minimum, insect and disease control in conformance
with State of Illinois licensing requirements, pruning, fertilization, weed
control and watering.
   A.   Natural Resource Protection Areas:
      1.   During construction and during the time that the developer continues
to own a lot in a subdivision or planned unit development upon which has been
placed a conservation easement for the purpose of protecting natural resources,
it shall be the developer's responsibility to maintain such conservation
easement and to keep the area free of all buildings, equipment, storage areas
and other incursions and activities that threaten the integrity of the
protected resource.
      2.   Once a lot has been sold and after expiration of the required period
for guarantees, it shall be the responsibility of the owner of property upon
which a conservation easement has been placed for the purpose of protecting
natural resources to maintain such conservation easement and to keep the area
free of all buildings, storage areas, and other incursions and activities that
threaten the integrity of the protected resource.
   B.   Scenic Corridors: It shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which a scenic corridor is located to ensure that the scenic
corridor is maintained in conformance to the requirements of the Wadsworth
Zoning Ordinance 1  and the approved landscape plan where one exists and to
keep the area free of all buildings, unapproved landscape features, signs and
fences.
   C.   Other Restrictions: Nothing herein shall prevent the establishment and
enforcement by covenant or by the action of the governing body of a homeowners
association of higher standards of maintenance in accordance with the approved
landscape plan. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)
 
Notes
1 1. See Title 10 of this Code.
12-8-2: GUARANTEES:
   A.   Subdivisions And Planned Unit Developments: Landscape improvements
shall be subject to the same guarantees as other improvements under the
Subdivision Control Ordinance 1 . Such guarantees shall remain the
responsibility of the developer throughout the guarantee period. Further, it
shall be the developer's responsibility to remove and replace dead or diseased
plant materials, including any plant materials which fail to exhibit healthy,
vigorous growth compared to other materials in the vicinity. This
responsibility shall extend throughout the guarantee period.
   B.   Site Development Projects: The owner or developer shall guarantee all
materials for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of an
occupancy permit or other required approval by the Village. In no case shall
the guarantee period be less than one year from the date of the installation of
the plant materials.
   C.   Transplanted Materials: The owner or developer shall guarantee all
materials transplanted from on-site locations for the same period required for
nursery grown materials. (Ord. 97-473, 4-1-1997)

practical difficulty for the owner.
      2.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or general welfare or injurious to other property or improvement
in the immediate vicinity.
      3.   The variation will be the least deviation from the requirements of
this Title which will mitigate the hardship or practical difficulty which gives
basis to the variation.
      4.   The variation when granted will not also vary the provisions of
either the Wadsworth Subdivision Control Ordinance 1  or the Wadsworth Zoning
