         d.   The taxpayer's recalculation, accompanied by an amended or
revised tax return, in connection with the claim; and
         e.   A request for either a refund or a credit in connection with the
claim to be applied to the amount of tax, interest and penalties overpaid, and,
as applicable, related interest on the amount overpaid; provided, however, that
there shall be no refund and only a credit given in the event the taxpayer owes
any monies to the city.
      2.   Within fourteen (14) days of the receipt by the local tax
administrator of any claim for a refund or credit, the local tax administrator
shall either:
         a.   Grant the claim; or
         b.   Deny the claim, in whole or in part, together with a statement as
to the reason for the denial or the partial grant and denial.
      3.   In the event the local tax administrator grants, in whole or in
part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or
credit shall bear interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum, based
on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days and the number of days
elapsed, from the date of the overpayment to the date of mailing of a refund
check or the grant of a credit. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)

comply with the notice requirements of this chapter.
   A.   Each notice of audit shall contain the following information:
      1.   The tax;
      2.   The time period of the audit; and
      3.   A brief description of the books and records to be made available
for the auditor.
   B.   Any audit shall be conducted during normal business hours and if the
date and time selected by the local tax administrator is not agreeable to the
taxpayer, another date and time may be requested by the taxpayer within thirty
(30) days after the originally designated audit and during normal business
hours.
   C.   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven (7) days nor more
than thirty (30) days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer
and the local tax administrator agreed to some other convenient time. In the
event taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the thirty (30) days approved in
writing, that is convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.
   D.   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's
business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the city.
   E.   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available
its books and records for inspection by the city. If the taxpayer or tax
collector fails to provide the documents necessary for audit within the time
provided, the local tax administrator may issue a tax determination and
assessment based on the tax administrator's determination of the best estimate
of the taxpayer's tax liability.
   F.   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of a locally
imposed and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the
amount of overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days of
the city's determination of the amount of overpayment.
   G.   In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect local
governmental entity, the local tax administrator shall notify the local
governmental entity imposing such tax. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-9: APPEAL:
   A.   The local tax administrator shall send written notice to a taxpayer
upon the local tax administrator's issuance of a protestable notice of tax due,
a bill, a claim denial, or a notice of claim reduction regarding any tax. The
notice shall include the following information:
      1.   The reason for the assessment;
      2.   The amount of the tax liability proposed;
      3.   The procedure for appealing the assessment; and
      4.   The obligations of the city during the audit, appeal, refund and
collection process.
   B.   A taxpayer who receives written notice from the local tax administrator
of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the local tax
administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting forth the
basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest and petition
for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within forty five
(45) days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.
   C.   If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the local
tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the written protest and petition for
hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
   D.   If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within the
forty five (45) day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.
   E.   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty five
(45) day period. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-10: HEARING:
   A.   Whenever a taxpayer or a tax collector has filed a timely written
protest and petition for hearing under section
1-14-9 of this chapter, the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing
regarding any appeal. The taxpayer may request that a hearing officer conduct
the hearing rather than the local tax administrator.
   B.   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a continuance is
absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation
shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted shall not
exceed fourteen (14) days.
   C.   At the hearing the local tax administrator/hearing officer shall
preside and shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax
determination, audit or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to
judicial proceedings shall not apply.
   D.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator/hearing
officer shall make a written determination on the basis of the evidence
presented at the hearing. The taxpayer or tax collector shall be provided with
a copy of the written decision. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-11: INTEREST AND PENALTIES:
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be
twelve percent (12%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five
(365) days and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty, of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing
a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file
penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the total tax
due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be
filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file
penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer
fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or fails to
demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local
administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in
a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing.
The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of the
reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
city, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city
clerk's office. (Ord. 3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-17: LIEN:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
3020, 5-21-2001)
1-14-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict
with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be controlling.

CHAPTER 15
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SECTION:
1-15-1: Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-15-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-15-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-15-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-15-5: Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-15-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
1-15-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the City of Taylorville, Illinois, a Municipal
corporation (herein "City") to prohibit harassment of any person by any City
official, agent, employee, agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All
City officials, agents, employees, agencies or offices are prohibited from
sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or
lack thereof. (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017, eff. 12-18-2017)
1-15-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
This Chapter adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   A.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
      2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as
the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
      3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      1.   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and
jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
      2.   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls", "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing
the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
"reasonable person". (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017, eff. 12-18-2017)
1-15-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
A City employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending City employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any City employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
   A.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassing behavior
in the workplace, the harassed City employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
   B.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel: At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the City employee feels threatened
or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, the
Human Resources Manager, or the Mayor.
   C.   Notification: The City employee experiencing what he or she believes to
be sexual harassment must not assume that the City is aware of the conduct. If
there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the City will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
   D.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this Chapter is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
City. However, all City employees have the right to contact the Illinois
Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint
with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the City. However,
because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the
difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017,
eff. 12-18-2017)
1-15-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No City official, employee, agency or office shall take any retaliatory
action against any City employee due to a City employee's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
Chapter; or
      2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this Chapter; or
      3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this Chapter.
   B.   For the purposes of this Chapter, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any City employee that is
taken in retaliation for a City employee's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this Chapter.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act 1  provides whistleblower protection
from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for a City employee
who does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any City officer, appointee, agent, or
employee that the City employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law,
rule, or regulation; or
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any City officer, appointee, agent, or employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act 2 , an employer may not retaliate
against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other
proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation 3 .
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act 4 , it is a civil rights
violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate
against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in
good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has
made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an
investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge - due within one hundred eighty (180) days (IDHR) or three
hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017,
eff. 12-18-2017)

1-15-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
City policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this Chapter or the
Prohibition On Sexual Harassment contained in 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes 430/
5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the City and any other
applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State
law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any
discipline imposed by the City shall be separate and distinct from any penalty
imposed by an Ethics Commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court
of law or a State or Federal agency. (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017, eff. 12-18-2017)
1-15-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this Chapter shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
City policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an Ethics Commission, an Inspector General, the State Police, a State's
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An Ethics Commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 3825, 12-18-2017, eff.

ascribed to them as follows:
      FACILITATOR: Any person or entity who provides a means through which a

money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits, and property or services of any kind or nature, including but not
limited to, amounts charged for the making, booking, facilitating or servicing

motel by a facilitator for room occupancy by the consumer; and (b) the amount
retained by the facilitator for travel-related services provided to the
consumer (sometimes referred to as a "facilitation fee"), and any additional
amounts retained by the facilitator as compensation for its services to the
consumer for the individual transaction, or, in the instance of a consumer's
direct rental of a room with the hotel or motel, gross rent shall mean the
amount charged by the hotel or motel directly to the consumer for the occupancy
of the room.
      HOTEL: A structure kept, used or maintained as or advertised or held out
to the public to be an inn, motel, hotel, apartment, home, lodging house,

a hotel.
      LESSOR: Any person having a sufficient proprietary interest in conducting

hotel or motel rooms and makes other travel arrangements for consumers via the
World Wide Web, internet or other digital means. Online travel companies are

occupy all or part of a hotel for more than thirty (30) consecutive days.
      PERSON: Any natural person, receiver, administrator, executor,

partnership, joint venture, club, company, business trust, domestic or foreign
corporation, association, syndicate, society or any group of individuals acting
as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit, or otherwise,
whenever the term "person" is used in any clause prescribing and imposing a
penalty, the term as applied to associations shall mean the owners or part-
owners thereof, and as applied to corporations, the offices thereof, or any
other entity recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties.
      TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY RENTAL UNIT: A dwelling unit or a habitable unit that

related to a particular transaction, the lessors are jointly and severally

Notwithstanding any other provision in this section concerning the time within

to the city shall include a statement of gross receipts as shown by the

assessed and collected in the same manner as any other penalty provided for in
this section.
The chief executive officer, proprietor, owner or highest ranking manager shall
sign the annual return to certify the accuracy of the information contained
therein. Any person who wilfully signs the annual return containing false or
inaccurate information shall be guilty of perjury and punished accordingly. The
annual return form prescribed by the city shall include a warning that the
person signing the return may be liable for perjury.
The foregoing portion of this subsection concerning the filing of an annual
information return shall not apply to an operator who is not required to file

powers necessary to enforce the collection of the tax imposed and collected by
the city pursuant to this section including, but not limited to, subpoena power
and the power to create and enforce liens. No such lien shall affect the rights
of bona fide purchasers, mortgagees, judgment creditors or other lien holders
who acquire their interests in such property prior to the time a notice of such
lien is placed on record in the office of the recorder of deeds of Christian
County. Any such lien placed of record shall only act as a lien upon property
located within the corporate boundaries of the city. In creating a lien
pursuant to this subsection, the procedures for its notice and enforcement
shall be the same as those provided for in the retailers' occupation tax act,
as now or hereafter amended, for state tax liens, and the recorder of deeds
with whom a notice of such lien is filed shall treat such lien as a state tax
lien for recording purposes.

the city in the discharge of his or her duties in the performance of this
section. It shall be the duty of every owner to keep accurate and complete

the false fire alarm has been acknowledged.

have the right to inspect any alarm system on the premises to which a response
has been made, and he may cause an inspection of such system to be made at any
reasonable time thereafter.

protected premises is notified or aware that their alarm system has been
activated, the alarm user or owner's designated representative shall cooperate
with any investigation undertaken by City personnel in responding to the
activated alarm. This shall include, but not be limited to, the alarm user's or
owner's presence at the premises protected by said alarm within a reasonable
period of time after the alarm or owner becomes aware that the alarm has been
activated. Furthermore, the use of an alarm system and its activation shall
constitute consent on the part of the alarm user and owner of the premises to
City personnel permitting said personnel to enter the premises to investigate
the cause(s) of the alarm. The alarm user's or owner's failure to cooperate in
any of the foregoing investigations shall constitute a violation of this

fee hereunder shall make payment in full to the City Clerk within thirty (30)

will be counted per system. The fact that an alarm user subscribes to an alarm
system shall be no defense. This fee is imposed whether the Fire Department or
the designated agency received the alarm by direct connection or through an
intermediary such as an answering service or modified central station. The fee
imposed by this Section is imposed solely when the choice is made to employ an
alarm system. If the possessor of the alarm shows to the satisfaction of the

improper maintenance, such fee may be waived. (Ord. 3386, 6-2-2008)

preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights of way and the city as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this article, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the city and, in particular, the use of the

parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Article: This article applies to all
facilities now existing or heretofore or hereafter located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the jurisdiction
of the city. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of
this article may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the
utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise
provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement and/or obtain a permit for the
privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within the city rights of way. Utilities that are not required by
law to enter into such an agreement may request that the city enter into such
an agreement. In such an agreement, the city may provide for terms and
conditions inconsistent with this article.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:

a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement
shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful
renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Articles Or Chapters: This article supersedes all
articles or chapters or parts of articles or chapters adopted prior hereto that
are in conflict herewith, but only to the extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or Illinois laws, statutes, rules or regulations conflict with the
requirements of this article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of
this article to the maximum extent possible without violating applicable
federal or Illinois laws, statutes, rules or regulations.
   H.   Variances: When administering this article, the city may vary the
standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this article when the city
in the exercise of sound engineering judgment, so determines; provided,
however, nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to
regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare as the city determines in its sole discretion. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)

   A.   City Review Of Permit Applications: Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be referred to and examined by the
city engineer within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does
not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the city engineer shall reject such application in writing,
stating the reasons therefor. If the city engineer is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this article and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the city clerk shall issue a
permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty
of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the city engineer, that
the construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance
with the requirements of this article.
   B.   Additional City Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the telephone company act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city
that it intends to commence work governed by this article for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the city not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The city engineer
shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the city engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this article.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a permit
is required for work pursuant to section
8-1G-4 of this article the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the city
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection A of this
section.
   C.   Additional City Review Of Applications Of Holders Of State
Authorization Under The Cable And Video Competition Law Of 2007: Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state issued authorization under the cable
and video competition law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days
after submission to the city, unless otherwise acted upon by the city, provided
the holder has complied with all applicable city codes, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)
8-1G-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this article on city rights of way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
   B.   Duration: No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this article prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the city with such city representatives
in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the city
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. (Ord.
3706, 4-6-2015)
8-1G-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
8-1G-21 of this article. If the city denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)
8-1G-8: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the rights of way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the city, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
representatives, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
subsections A1 and A2 of this section.
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city clerk within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the city.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the City's Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the city evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-
insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection
A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-
insurer" under the workers' compensation act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better

8-1G-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to and shall defend, indemnify and hold the city and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, of any kind, nature or extent whatsoever
arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the
negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct
of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of
the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities,
whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this
article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however,
that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses to the extent
they arise out of or result from the negligence or misconduct by the city, its
officials, officers, employees, agents, or representatives. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-
2015)
8-1G-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this article;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this article; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the city engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities
in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the city engineer may, in the
exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal
to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of
this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to the
security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved
by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights that
may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)

or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection A of this
section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2) upon
not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days' notice to
the permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the city. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the city
for all costs of removal. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)

to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With City Facilities: No utility facilities shall be
placed in any location if the city engineer determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the city's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the city's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right of way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right of
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right of way.
      4.   No Limitations On Visibility: No utility facility shall be placed in

without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right of way line and any above
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right of way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of city highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.

provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The city may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right of way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
   D.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights Of Way: The city may
require that facilities be located within particular rights of way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
   E.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   The city may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right of way.
      2.   The city may require any freestanding facility located within a
right of way to be screened from view.

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
superintendent of streets and sewers or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection

variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The city engineer may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the city engineer may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of
this article.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the city
engineer under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to

with the general penalty provisions of
title 1, chapter 4 of this code. There may be times when the city will incur
delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will
not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the
utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested
action is appropriate, the utility shall bear and pay the city's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other
administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related
cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that
does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 3706, 4-6-2015)

ensure payment of the account at the time of application for service.
   D.   Plumbing: There shall be no water service to any premises in which the
plumbing does not comply with ordinances of the City; except, that water
service may be provided for construction purposes in unfinished buildings,
subject to the provisions of this Chapter.
   E.   Tapping Water Main:
      1.   Permit Required: No connection with the City water main shall be
made without a tapping permit being issued by the City.
      2.   Specifications:
         a.   Before any new connection is made to the water distribution
system of the City, the premises to be served shall be equipped with a water
meter and water meter well that is properly installed on the service pipe; and
such water meter and water meter well shall be located outside of the structure
(s) at said premises and at such outside location that is approved by the Water
Superintendent and/or his designee. Type K copper shall be installed a minimum
of five feet (5') beyond the water meter well. All services shall be installed
with a minimum ground cover of forty eight inches (48"). Solder joints shall
not be used where the piping will be underground. No installation shall be
covered until it has been inspected by the Water Superintendent and/or his
designee and found satisfactory. Any exceptions to the foregoing requirements
must receive the prior written approval of the Water Superintendent which
approval or disapproval shall be determined as the Water Superintendent, in his
sole discretion, deems appropriate and in the best interest of the City's Water
Department.
         b.   No premises shall be connected with the water distribution system
of the City unless the premises have a shutoff valve and a drain located inside
the structure(s) to be served, so that the supply of water may be shut off and
the water pipes drained inside the structure(s). When it is deemed necessary by
the Water Superintendent and/or his designee, a shutoff valve shall be
installed on both inlet and outlet sides of the water meter. No connection
shall be covered until the Water Superintendent and/or his designee has
inspected the work.
   F.   Service Connection Fee: Applications for permits to connect service

in addition to the tapping fee for tapping any City water line.
   H.   Extensions/Connections:
      1.   If an extension of one of the water mains is required for
connection, the city council shall first determine if an extension of a water
main is economically feasible based on the estimated cost of the extension and
the number of existing or potential users that will use the water along the
extension and if such extension will enhance the overall economic benefit to
the city.
If the extension is approved, the city may, in its sole discretion, install and
pay, in whole or in part, the cost of such extension to the nearest property
boundary line of the first property to be serviced from such extension. If the
city elects, in its sole discretion, not to pay such cost, in whole or in part,
then the property owner(s) shall pay the cost, which the city has elected not
to pay, to extend such water main from the nearest location of the then
existing water main to the property to be serviced.
In any event, and in all cases in which there is to be any connection to the
city's water main, the property owner(s) shall pay the cost to extend the water
main the entire width or length (depending upon the direction of such
extension) of the property owner's property to be serviced and/or for such
additional distance or direction along the property owner's property to be
serviced, as determined by the city council from time to time, so that such
extension, after completion thereof, immediately borders adjacent property in
such a manner that future extensions can directly be made to service adjacent
property or properties.
Such "costs", as referred to herein, shall include, but not be limited to, all
engineering fees, the city's attorney fees, all recording fees, all costs for
survey and easement plats, all costs relating to easement instruments, all
title insurance fees and all costs, materials, equipment, and labor relating to
and for the construction of such water main extension.
Such water main extension shall be constructed according to such plans and
specifications as may be determined by the city council from time to time. If
the city elects not to perform the work to install such extension or have
others do so on behalf of the city, then the property owner(s) must obtain the
written consent and approval of the city as to the contractor(s) who will
install such water extension. Any such "costs" owed to the city shall be paid
to the city by such property owner(s) within fourteen (14) days of mailing of a
bill therefor to such property owner(s) or their representative, or prior to
any connection to such extension, whichever event first occurs. Prior to any
such extension, the property owner(s) shall sign and provide the city with
permanent easements and temporary construction easements for such water main
extension in such form as the city council may determine from time to time. The
foregoing requirements shall also be deemed as additional requirements under
title 11 of this code.
      2.   All subdivision developers shall pay a five hundred dollar ($500.00)
water tap-on fee per subdivision.
   I.   Water Tap-On Fee Waiver: When a subdivision developer installs a
subdivision water main and pays to tap the subdivision water main onto the
city's water main, any tap-on fees within the subdivision on the developer's
installed subdivision water main shall be waived for a period of five (5) years
from the date the subdivision EPA operating permit is issued. After the five
(5) year period noted herein, tap-on fees within the subdivision shall be
charged to the respective residents.
      1.   The waiver of tap-on fees as set forth herein shall only apply to
residential tap-ons.
      2.   This subsection I shall apply to any existing subdivisions,
subdivisions currently being developed, and those subdivisions to be developed
in the future. (Ord. 3503, 1-18-2011; amd. Ord. 3779, 11-7-2016; Ord. 3847, 5-

stations and wastewater treatment facilities, have sufficient reserve capacity
to adequately and efficiently handle the additional anticipated waste load.
   B.   Separate Sewers Required: A separate and independent building sewer
shall be provided for every building; except, that where one building stands at
the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can
be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or
driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.
   C.   Construction Specifications:
      1.   Private Sewers: All new private sewers within a building or within
five feet (5') of any part of a building or within ten feet (10') of a water
service pipe shall be cast iron soil pipe ASTM specification (A 74) and shall
comply with the Illinois state plumbing code, latest edition 1 . New private
sanitary sewers beyond the limits described above for connection with the
public sewer shall be one of the following:
         a.   Cast iron soil pipe - ASTM specification A 74.
         b.   Vitrified clay sewer pipe - ASTM specification C 13 or C 700.
         c.   Concrete sewer pipe - ASTM specification C 14, C 75 or C 76.
         d.   ABS sewer pipe.
         e.   PVC sewer pipe - ASTM D-3033, SDR 34 for 4", SDR 41 for 6",
schedule 40.
Any pipe material not conforming to the requirements of the above ASTM
specifications will not be permitted unless specific approval is granted by
vote of the city council.
      2.   Public Sewers:
         a.   Joints on all house sewers shall be made permanently gastight and
waterproof.
         b.   Cast iron soil pipe shall be jointed with lead and jute by a
competent plumber.
         c.   Vitrified clay pipe shall be fitted with factory made plastic
joint conforming to ASTM specifications C-425.
         d.   Concrete pipe shall be fitted with factory furnished rubber
gaskets which shall conform to ASTM specification 361, section 13. Rubber
gasket joints shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions and shall provide a watertight and gastight joint.
         e.   Joints between vitrified clay and concrete pipe or metal shall be
made with jute and a bituminous jointing material. Bituminous material for such
joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joints
when subjected to a temperature of one hundred sixty degrees Fahrenheit (160°F)
nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The
superintendent of streets and sewers may, at his discretion, require the
additional protection of a concrete envelope on such joints.
         f.   ABS pipe shall be chemically welded joints conforming to ASTM
specification D2680-72 and latest revisions.
         g.   PVC pipe shall have rubber gasketed joints.
   D.   Connections To Public Sewers:
      1.   The applicant for a permit to tap a public sewer shall notify the
city when such sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the superintendent
of streets and sewers or his authorized representative.
      2.   The connection of the building or property sewer shall be made at a
"Y" or "T" branch if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If no
properly located "Y" or "T" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into
the public sewer to receive the building or property sewer, with entry in the
downstream direction, at an angle of about forty five degrees (45°). A "saddle"
shall be used to make such connections, the spigot end to extend not past the
inner surface of such sewer. The centerline of the building sewer at the point
of connection shall be at the same or a higher elevation than the centerline of
the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made and the connection made
secure and watertight by encasement, if necessary, in concrete. Other fittings
may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent of
streets and sewers.
      3.   The sewer systems from any residences or commercial establishments
constructed after the effective date hereof shall be constructed and connected
with the public sewer in full compliance with this chapter. Where existing
septic tanks combine sanitary sewage with roof drains or foundation drains or
drain tile capable of collecting surface or subsurface water, a complete
separation shall be made so that only sanitary sewer wastes are carried
directly in watertight joints to the public sewer. Where any doubt exists on
the type or quality of construction, the superintendent of streets and sewers
may require the owner to uncover the existing service for inspection. Where any
doubt exists on the complete separation of roof drains, surface drains or
surface drain tile, the superintendent of streets and sewers may require the
owner of the establishment to prove, by excavation and exposure, that complete
separation exists.
      4.   Where a building presently connected to a septic tank desires to
connect to the public sewer, the connection shall be made from the public sewer
to the service piping upstream of the septic tank if it is demonstrated that
the existing service piping is in satisfactory condition. Under no
circumstances shall the connection be made on the downstream side of the septic
tank nor shall any septic tank laterals be connected to the public sewer.
      5.   No basement, half basement or any other portion of a building having
a floor elevation beneath the ground surface over the public sewer at the point
of connection may be connected into the public sewer by gravity. In areas where
the ground line over the public sewer is to be altered, the proposed final
ground elevation shall be used. The maximum depth to the top of the building
service sewer shall be three feet (3') below finished grade at the point where
it enters such building. In all buildings in which the building drain is too
low to provide gravity flow to the public sewer, all sewage carried by such
drain shall be lifted by approved mechanical means and discharged into the
building sewer. No water operated sewage ejector shall be used.
   E.   Extensions/Connections:
      1.   If an extension of one of the sewer mains is required for
connection, the city council shall first determine if an extension of a sewer
main is economically feasible based on the estimated cost of the extension and
the number of existing or potential users that will use the sewer along the
extension and if such extension will enhance the overall economic benefit to
the city.
If the extension is approved, the city may, in its sole discretion, install and
pay, in whole or in part, the cost of such extension to the nearest property
boundary line of the first property to be serviced from such extension. If the
city elects, in its sole discretion, not to pay such cost, in whole or in part,
then the property owner(s) shall pay the cost, which the city has elected not
to pay, to extend such sewer main from the nearest location of the then
existing sewer main to the property to be serviced.
In any event, and in all cases in which there is to be any connection to the
city's sanitary sewer main, the property owner (developer) shall pay the cost
to extend the sanitary sewer main the entire width or length (depending upon
the direction of such extension) of the property owner's property to be
serviced and/or for such additional distance or direction along the property
owner's property to be serviced, as determined by the city council from time to
time, and shall be installed at the maximum depth and at minimum grade as
determined by the city engineer or the street and sewer superintendent, so that
such extension, after completion thereof, immediately borders adjacent property
in such a manner that future extensions can directly be made to service
adjacent property or properties.
Such "costs", as referred to herein, shall include, but not be limited to, all
engineering fees, the city's attorney fees, all recording fees, all cost for
survey and easement plats, all costs relating to easement instruments, all
title insurance fees and all costs, materials, equipment, and labor relating to
and for the construction of such sewer main extension.
Such sewer main extension shall be constructed according to such plans and
specifications as may be determined by the city council from time to time. If
the city elects not to perform the work to install such extension or have
others do so on behalf of the city, then the property owner(s) must obtain the
written consent and approval of the city as to the contractor(s) who will
install such sewer extension. Any such "costs" owed to the city shall be paid
to the city by such property owner(s) within fourteen (14) days of mailing of a
bill therefor to such property owner(s) or their representative, or prior to
any connection to such extension, whichever event first occurs. Prior to any
such extension, the property owner(s) shall sign and provide the city with
permanent easements and temporary construction easements for such sewer main
extension in such form as the city council may determine from time to time. The
foregoing requirements shall also be deemed as additional requirements under
title 11 of this code.
      2.   If someone other than the city installs an extension of one of the
sewer mains, the city must approve all plans and specifications for any
extensions. Ownership, rights of way and title must be conveyed to the city for
all extensions installed by anyone other than the city. The city will maintain
the mains thereafter.
No extension will be permitted if, in the opinion of the city council, the
system does not have the necessary capacity to serve the proposed extension.
   F.   Surface Water Runoff:
      1.   It shall be unlawful to construct or permit the construction of any
stormwater drain which discharges water onto any sidewalk in the city, and it
shall be unlawful to construct or permit the maintenance of any such drain
which discharges into any public street or alley at a height greater than
eighteen inches (18") above the ground or pavement.
      2.   No drain tile or foundation tile which could or does collect surface
or subsurface water shall be constructed directly to the sanitary sewer system
of the city.
   G.   Cross Connections: It shall be unlawful to permit any sanitary sewage
to flow into any drain, gutter or pipe installed for the flow of surface water
drainage only or to permit sanitary sewage to flow into the stormwater drainage
system.
   H.   Excavations:
      1.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
      2.   Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.
      3.   The provisions of all city ordinances relating to excavations 1  in
streets or other public places shall be complied with in making sewer
connections.
   I.   Liability Of Property Owner:
      1.   All costs and expenses incident to the initial installation of the
property owner's building sewer service line and connection (tap on) of the
property owner's building sewer service line to the City's public sewer system
(trunk line) shall be borne and paid by the property owner. Such initial
installation and connection work shall be performed by an Illinois licensed
plumber; and all such installation and connection work must be performed to the
satisfaction of the City Street and Sewer Superintendent or his designee. The
City shall provide the "saddle tap" for the connection (tap on) of the property
owner's building sewer service line to the City's public sewer system (trunk
line); and any "Y" tap must be separated from the City's public sewer system
(trunk line).
      2.   The property owner shall be solely responsible and liable for the
expenses, maintenance, repair, and/or replacement of the property owner's
building sewer service line up to its connection (tap on) to the City's public
sewer system (trunk line) wheresoever located. All such maintenance, repair,
and/or replacement work shall be performed by an Illinois licensed plumber.
In extenuating cost circumstances, the City Council may, in its sole discretion
and upon recommendation from the City's Street and Sewer Committee from time to
time, review and determine responsibility of the property owner for any
maintenance, repair, and/or replacement work to the property owner's building
sewer service line up to its connection (tap on) to the City's public sewer
system (trunk line) to the extent said building sewer service line is located
outside the property owner's property boundary lines but is located within City
property.
      3.   The City shall repair and/or replace such portion of the City's
public sewer system (trunk line) and/or the public sewer connection (tap) to
the property owners' sewer service line (but not the property owner's sewer
service line itself) that is located within the City's property or within the
City's right of way or easement.
Provided the property owner provides the City with free access to the property
owner's property, the City may also repair such portion of the City's public
sewer system (but not the property owner's sewer service line itself) up to the
property owner's sewer service line connection (tap) to the City's public sewer
system (trunk line) that is located within the property owner's property
boundary lines (but outside of the City's right of way or easement area located
on the property owner's property).
      4.   The City's Street and Sewer Superintendent or his designee shall
determine in his or her sole discretion the reasonableness and necessity and
the nature and extent of any and all of the aforesaid repair or replacement
work to protect and maintain and avoid any further damage to the City's public
sewer system.
   J.   Disconnection From Sewers: Any person desiring or planning to
disconnect from a sewer outlet in the city sewer and sanitary system shall
first notify the superintendent of streets and sewers of the intention to so
disconnect and, in no event, shall such person commence action to disconnect
from the sewer outlet until either the superintendent of streets and sewers or
his duly authorized representative is available to inspect and approve the
disconnection.

the characteristics enumerated in subsection B1 of this section and/or which
are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in chapter 1, EPA
rules and regulations, subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128-Pretreatment
Standards, federal register volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973, and
any amendments thereto, and which, in the judgment of the superintendent, may
have a deleterious effect upon the sewer system or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may:
         a.   Reject the wastes.
         b.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
         c.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the superintendent and subject to the requirements of
all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   C.   Interceptors: Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when,
in the opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except, that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarter or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
superintendent and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   D.   Preliminary Treatment: Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   E.   Control Manhole For Industrial Wastes: Each industry shall be required
to install a control manhole and, when required by the superintendent, the
owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes
shall install a suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters
and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be
accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at
his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at
all times.
   F.   Measurements, Tests And Analyses:
      1.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge. The number, type and frequency of laboratory
analysis to be performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the city, but
no less than once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the
constituents of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the
federal, state and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the
results of measurements and laboratory analysis to the city at such times and
in such manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of
all measurements, analyses and reporting required by the city. At such times as
deemed necessary, the city reserves the right to take measurements and samples
for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
      2.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods For The
Examination Of Water And Wastewater", published by the American Public Health
Association and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite of all
outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24 hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.)
   G.   Special Agreements: No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment
therefor, by the industrial concern; provided such payments are in accordance
with federal and state guidelines for user charge system and industrial cost
recovery system. (Ord. 2078, 11-15-1982)
   H.   Control Of Fats, Oils, And Greases:
      1.   Scope And Purpose: To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer
blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of fats, oils,
and greases into the sanitary sewer system from industrial or commercial
establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities. Any
nonresidential facility connected to the city's sanitary sewer collection and
treatment system involved in the preparation or serving of foods shall be
subject to the conditions of this section.
      2.   Definitions:
         FATS, OILS, AND GREASES: Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules.
These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures
established in the United States code of federal regulations 40 CFR 136, as may
be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as "grease"
or "greases".
         FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS: Those establishments primarily engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for consumption
by the public such as restaurant, commercial kitchen, caterer, hotel, school,
hospital, prison, correctional facility, and care institution. These
establishments use one or more of the following preparation activities: cooking
by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie
cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or
poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any
other food preparation activity that produces a hot, nondrinkable food product
in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
         GREASE INTERCEPTOR: A structure or device designed for the purpose of
removing and preventing fats, oils, and grease from entering the sanitary sewer
collection system. These devices are often belowground units in outside areas
and are built as two (2) or three (3) chamber baffled tanks.
         GREASE TRAP: A device for separating and retaining waterborne greases
and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and entering the
sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are typically
compact under the sink units that are near food preparation areas.
         MINIMUM DESIGN CAPABILITY: The design features of a grease interceptor
and its ability or volume required to effectively intercept and retain greases
from grease laden wastewaters discharged to the public sanitary sewer.
         USER: Any person, including those located outside the jurisdictional
limits of the city of Taylorville, who contributes, causes or permits the
contribution or discharge of wastewater into sewers within the city's
boundaries, including persons who contribute such wastewater from mobile
sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.
      3.   Food Service Establishment Permit Requirement: All permitted food
service establishments discharging wastewater to the city of Taylorville
sanitary sewer collection system are subject to the following requirements:
         a.   Grease Interceptor Requirements: All permitted food service
establishments are required to install, operate, and maintain an approved type
and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with
the objectives of this subsection H. All grease interceptors must meet the
requirements of the state of Illinois plumbing code.
         b.   Implementation: All new food service establishment facilities are
subject to grease interceptor requirements. All such facilities must obtain
prior approval from the state plumber/city engineer and county inspector for
grease interceptor sizing prior to submitting plans for a building permit. All
grease interceptors shall be installed outside the building for cleaning and
inspection. Existing facilities with planned modification in plumbing
improvements, with a building permit evaluation of twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00) or more will be required to include plans to comply with the
grease interceptor requirements. These facilities must obtain approval from the
state plumber/city engineer and county inspector for grease interceptor sizing
prior to submitting plans for a building permit.
All existing food service establishments, determined by the state plumber/city
engineer and county inspector, to have a reasonable potential to adversely
impact the city's sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install
a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification
letter.
         c.   Variance From Grease Interceptor Requirements: Grease
interceptors required under this subsection H shall be installed unless the
state plumber/city engineer and county inspector authorizes the installation of
an indoor grease trap or other alternative pretreatment technology and
determines that the installation of a grease interceptor would not be feasible.
The food service establishment bears the burden of demonstrating that the
installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The state plumber/city
engineer or county inspector may authorize the installation of an indoor grease
trap where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible due to
space constraints or other considerations. If an establishment believes the
installation of a grease interceptor is infeasible, because of documented space
constraints, the request for an alternate grease removal device shall contain
the following information:
            (1)   Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside building.
            (2)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing
for all services at that site.
Alternative pretreatment technology includes, but is not limited to, devices
that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it
from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system. All
alternative pretreatment technology must be appropriately sized and approved by
the State plumber/City Engineer and County inspector.
      4.   Grease Interceptor Requirements:
         a.   Grease interceptor sizing and installation shall conform to the
current edition of the State of Illinois Plumbing Code.
         b.   Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with
design approved by the State plumber/City Engineer and County inspector and
shall have a minimum of two (2) compartments with fittings designed for grease
retention.
         c.   Grease interceptors shall be installed outside at a location
where it shall be easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of
intercepted grease. The grease interceptor may not be installed in any part of
the building where food is handled. Location of the grease interceptor must
meet the approval of the State plumber/City Engineer and County inspector.
         d.   All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of
accumulated waste content at least every three (3) months or when needed in
order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume. These devices
should be inspected at least monthly. Users who are required to maintain a
grease interceptor shall:
            (1)   Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time in accordance
with the State of Illinois Plumbing Code.
            (2)   Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as
required. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials
such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels,
rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the
effective volume of the device.
         e.   The user shall maintain a written record of inspection and
maintenance for two (2) years. All such records will be made available for on
site inspection by representative of the City of Taylorville during all
operating hours.
         f.   The users shall give the City of Taylorville written record of
cleaning of grease interceptor every three (3) months or when City of
Taylorville Sewer Superintendent or County inspector say when written records
are required. If not in compliance, City of Taylorville may fine user seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) and/or shut off water. The fine set forth
herein is an addition to any penalty as set forth in Section
 8-5-9 of this Chapter.
         g.   Sanitary wastes are not allowed to be connected to sewer lines
intended for grease interceptor service.
         h.   Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of twenty four inches
(24"), shall be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and sanitary tee.
The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and
maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also
have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and
wastewater sampling activities.
      5.   Grease Trap Requirements:
         a.   Upon approval by the State plumber/City Engineer and County
inspector, a grease trap complying with the provisions of this Section must be
installed in the waste line leading from sinks, drains, and other fixtures or
equipment in food service establishments where grease may be introduced into
the drainage or sewage system in quantities that can effect line stoppage or
hinder sewage treatment or private sewage disposal.
         b.   Grease traps sizing and installation shall conform to the State
of Illinois Plumbing Code.
         c.   No grease trap shall be installed which has a stated rate flow of
more than fifty five (55) gallons per minute, nor less than twenty (20) gallons
per minute, except when specially approved by the State plumber/City Engineer
and County inspector.
         d.   Grease traps shall be maintained in efficient operating
conditions by periodic removal of the accumulated grease. No such collected
grease shall be introduced into any drainage piping, or public or private
sewer.
         e.   No food waste disposal unit or dishwasher shall be connected to
or discharge into any grease trap.
         f.   Wastewater in excess of one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit
(140°F)/(60°C) shall not be discharged into a grease trap. (Ord. 3514, 5-16-
2011)

11-2-3: SUBDIVISION SITE AND SITE PLAN SUITABILITY:
   A.   Essential Utilities And Public Services: Land proposed to be subdivided
shall have essential utilities and public services available within a
reasonable distance and time period. Land to which these essential utilities
and services will not be so provided shall be deemed unsuitable for
subdividing. Essential utilities and services and criteria for determining if
they can adequately be provided shall include the following:
      1.   Sewage Disposal:
         a.   Sanitary sewer service provided by the city of Taylorville shall
be the preferred method of sewage disposal. If sanitary sewer service is
currently available to the land proposed to be subdivided, it shall be the
sewage disposal method used.
         b.   If sanitary sewer service is not currently available but the land
is within the ultimate service area as identified in the Taylorville sanitary
district's facility plan and the sanitary district determines that sewer
service will be available within a reasonable period, the land may be deemed
suitable for subdividing if:
            (1)   On site sewage disposal facilities can and will be provided.
         c.   If the land cannot be served with sanitary trunk sewers within a
reasonable period, or if the land is not within the ultimate service area as
identified in the Taylorville sanitary district's facility plan and therefore
shall be unsuitable for subdividing unless it can be shown that adequate
private sewage systems can be provided.
      2.   Water Supply:
         a.   An Illinois environmental protection agency approved public water
supply shall be the preferred method of water supply.
         b.   Private wells may be permitted for development outside the city
if the developer can demonstrate that it is not feasible to extend water mains
to the land proposed to be subdivided. As a minimum guideline, the extension of
one hundred twenty feet plus or minus (120'±) of water main per lot of the
preliminary plan shall be deemed feasible. This distance shall be measured
between the nearest suitable public water main and the proposed development.
Mains within the development shall not count toward this extension footage.
      3.   Fire Protection: Land proposed to be subdivided shall meet the
following conditions in order to be deemed suitable for subdividing:
         a.   Land shall be within the area served or to be served by the
Taylorville fire department or within a fire protection district, if possible;
         b.   There shall be a public road providing adequate access for
emergency vehicles to the site. Roadways shall have an all weather driving
surface (minimum oil and chip) with twenty feet (20') of unobstructed width.
Where a bridge is required to be used as a part of the most direct fire truck
access route, it shall have a minimum vertical clearance of thirteen feet six
inches (13'6") and be constructed and maintained to carry the live loads
imposed by firetrucks; and
         c.   There shall be a system of water mains or other source of water
adequate for firefighting purposes. Specific fire flows shall be determined by
the Taylorville fire department using a standard published by the insurance
service office entitled "Guide For Determination Of Required Fire Flow".
         d.   A full sprinkler system installed with adequate water available,
as determined by the National Fire Protection Association standards 13 or 13D
depending on the occupancy of the building, shall also satisfy this
requirement.
      4.   Streets: The suitability of existing streets for access to the
proposed subdivision and/or for incorporation into the proposed subdivision's
street system shall also be considered. A street shall be considered suitable
if:
         a.   The street is constructed of all weather material (concrete,
asphalt, oil mat); and has an adequate base course.
         b.   The paved area is at least twenty feet (20') wide with a roadbed
twenty four feet (24') wide; and
         c.   The street has good drainage.
If only a portion of the criteria set forth in this subsection A4 is met, the
city engineer, a representative of the Taylorville fire department, and a
representative of the plan commission shall make the recommendation as to
whether the street is suitable for the proposed development or what
improvements must be undertaken to make it possible.
      5.   Police Protection: In determining the suitability of land for
subdivision purposes, the distance that police would have to travel to respond
to a call for service shall be considered. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
   B.   Other Requirements: Land proposed to be subdivided or the site plan for
which approval is requested shall meet the following requirements: (Ord. 3636,
9-3-2013)
      1.   Site must be in conformance with the Taylorville comprehensive plan.
      2.   Development must be in accord with appropriate jurisdictional
floodplain regulations.
      3.   Development must not be located in any environmentally sensitive
area unless the subdivider can show that environmental concerns can be
mitigated.
      4.   Site must be of a shape, size and terrain so that usable lots and
streets in conformance with this title can and will be created.
      5.   Development must not have a major conflict with existing use of
adjacent property (wastewater treatment plants, power plants, major industrial
plants, landfills, certain agricultural uses, etc.) unless it is shown that
factors which cause the conflict can and will be mitigated.
      6.   Development must not cause major off site impacts and problems
relating to, but not limited to, streets, drainage water system, parks. If it
is determined by the plan commission that major off site impacts will result,
the subdivider must agree to mitigate the portion of the impact caused by the
subdivision.
      7.   When soils in the area to be developed have severe limitations for
building site development or sanitary facilities as determined by the USDA
natural resources conservation service, the subdivider shall submit information
indicating how these limitations will be addressed. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
      8.   Any proposed subdivision of land or site plan shall not be approved
where a portion of such land to be subdivided or where the land located within
a site plan is currently within the corporate limits of the city and the
remaining portion of land to be subdivided or included within a site plan is
located outside the corporate limits of the city until and unless the portion
outside the corporate limits of the city is annexed into the city by a city
ordinance upon a proper written petition of annexation signed by the owners of
record of such land and by at least fifty one percent (51%) of the electors who
reside upon such land. This annexation requirement shall apply regardless of
whether or not the proposed subdivision of land or the land included within the
site plan will be serviced by any city water or sanitary or storm sewer
services. (Ord. 3636, 9-3-2013)
11-2-4: REVIEW PROCESS:

been submitted to the plan commission within three (3) years from the date of
the reaffirmation, or if submitted, is not approved, the plan shall expire.
   E.   Final plat approval shall extend the validity of the preliminary plan
for three (3) years from the date of final plat approval, provided that the
plan commission may require any changes necessary to meet the requirements of
this title, and in such an event, the provisions of subsection C of this
section with respect to resubmission shall apply. The preliminary plan may be
reaffirmed one time after each final plat approval. If another final plat has
not been resubmitted within three (3) years from the date of the reaffirmation,
the preliminary plan shall expire. In the event a preliminary plan expires, a

Surface shall meet IDOT Standards.
         b.   Portland Cement Concrete: a minimum total thickness of seven (7)
inches of unreinforced Portland Cement Concrete, IDOT Class PV.
   D.   Pavement Width: All streets shall be improved with pavements to an
overall width in accordance with the following general guidelines, which are
subject in every case to the discretion of the city:
 
Type Of Street   Pavement Width1
Alley            20 foot minimum
Collector street 36 foot minimum
Cul-de-sac       90 foot diameter
Local street     27 foot minimum
Major highway    As required by IDOT or applicable agency
Major street     40 foot minimum
 
      1.   Edge of pavement to edge of pavement.
Different widths may be used depending on the anticipated traffic volumes and
parking demand. These widths of pavement shall be determined by the Plan
Commission and the City Engineer in consultation with the engineer for the
subdivider. If a pavement width narrower than the above stated minimum results
from this consultation, the subdivider shall install no-parking signs at his
expense.
   E.   Curb And Gutter:
      1.   The standard curb and gutter required adjacent to flexible pavement
shall be a mountable type constructed of Portland cement concrete with the
following dimensions: twenty four inches (24") wide, eight inches (8") thick on
the front face (pavement side), ten inches (10") thick on the back face, seven
inches (7") thick at center line (flow line), and a ten inch (10") radius in
the flow line. The curb and gutter adjacent to concrete pavement, if poured
monolithically, may be limited to the thickness of the pavement.
      2.   In subdivisions proposed to have streets with an anticipated daily
traffic volume of two thousand five hundred (2,500) or more, a barrier-type
curb and gutter similar to Type B6.18 as described in the State of Illinois,
Department of Transportation Highway Standards shall be used. Other locations
where a barrier-type curb and gutter are required shall be determined by the
engineer for the subdivision and the City Engineer.
   F.   Pavement Crown: The minimum crown used on all pavements shall be one-
quarter inch (1/4") per foot measured from the edge of the pavement to the
center line of the street.
   G.   Cul-De-Sac Streets: Local streets that are also cul-de-sac streets
shall be no more than six hundred feet (600') long unless necessitated by
topography in which case they shall be no longer than one thousand feet
(1,000') unless provision is made for an interim turnaround with a radius
sufficient to accommodate emergency vehicles and/or a median entrance (see
subsection I of this Section). A turnaround shall be provided at the closed end
having an outside roadway diameter of at least ninety feet (90') edge to edge
of pavement and a street right-of-way diameter of one hundred ten feet (110').
No obstructions shall be permitted in the cul-de-sac turnaround.
   H.   Stub Streets: Access shall be provided to adjoining property not yet
subdivided. Proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of
such unsubdivided property. At the end of all temporary stub streets, a
barricade meeting the provisions of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices shall be installed by the subdivider. Stub streets in excess of
two hundred fifty feet (250') shall be provided with a temporary cul-de-sac
with an outside roadway diameter of at least ninety feet (90'). The type of
construction shall be determined by the City Engineer. The subdivider shall
dedicate a temporary easement to the appropriate street authority in the amount
needed in excess of the normally required right of way for the temporary
turnaround. When the street is extended in the future, the extra turnaround
pavement shall be removed and curb and gutters and sidewalks constructed by the
subdivider who is constructing the street extension.
   I.   Multiple Access: Any area of development containing seventy (70) or
more single-family lots (or equivalent population) shall be served by two (2)
functioning points of access. Where higher densities of development are
proposed, a divided type entrance roadway may suffice with a median of adequate
width to ensure continued emergency access lanes on one side. Depending on
location and height of nearby poles or trees, the required median width shall
range between twelve (12) and thirty feet (30'). This type of roadway
construction is intended to accommodate higher density developments and not to
lengthen the overall length of a cul-de-sac.
   J.   Restriction Of Access: When a subdivision or a portion of it adjoins a
major street, no lot shall have direct access to the major street. The lot
shall have adequate depth for screen planting on the portion of the lot
contiguous to the major street.
   K.   Street Names And Street Signs:
      1.   A proposed street that is in alignment with and/or joins an existing
named street shall bear the name of the existing street. In no case shall the
proposed name of a street duplicate the name of an existing street within the
plat jurisdiction of this Title. The use of the suffix "street", "avenue",
"boulevard", "driveway", "place", "court", or similar description shall not be
a distinction sufficient to constitute compliance with this requirement.
      2.   Street name signs shall be erected at all intersections within the
City's jurisdiction at the expense of the subdivider and shall be subject to
the specifications of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
   L.   Private Streets: There shall be no private streets platted in any
subdivision. Every subdivision lot shall be served from a publicly dedicated
street.
   M.   Alleys: Alleys are not recommended in residential subdivisions unless
deemed necessary by the Plan Commission.
   N.   Ramps: Where sidewalks cross a barrier-type curb and gutter as
described in subsection E of this Section, ramps shall be constructed to
accommodate the handicapped. These ramps shall be constructed to the lines and
grades shown on the standard sidewalk ramp example. Inlets for storm drainage
shall not be located so that a pedestrianway will be interrupted by the inlet
grates. Other locations where these ramps are required shall be determined by
the City Engineer.

   P.   Median And Islands: Where medians or islands are proposed they shall be
constructed with barrier or curbing. All medians and islands shall be the
responsibility of the subdivider and/or a subdivision association to maintain.
No sign may be installed in the median which blocks the sight distance at the
intersection. If such a sign is to be installed, detailed plans for the sign
shall be submitted with the construction plans for approval. In no case shall
an island or median contain any other sign or structure except as may be placed
for traffic control under the direction of the City Engineer.
The subdivider or subdivision association may landscape medians or islands.
Ground cover may not exceed a maximum height of twelve inches (12"). Any
additional living plant material must be maintained to allow visibility across,
over or through medians and islands at a height of three to ten feet (3–10')
above the adjacent roadway pavements.
   Q.   Subdivisions Outside City Limits: Subdivisions within the one and one-
half (11/2) mile subdivision jurisdiction, but outside of the corporate City
limits.
      1.   Streets and roadways within the one and one-half (11/2) mile
subdivision limits, but outside of the corporate City limits may be constructed
by the developer as follows:

         g.   The aggregate base course shall be minimum of eight inches (8").
         h.   The surface shall be a minimum of bituminous surface treatment
Class A-3.
         i.   Right of way shall be a minimum of seventy feet (70').
         j.   Sidewalks shall not be required. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998; amd. Ord.
4122, 8-15-2022)
11-7-4: LOT AND BLOCK DESIGN:
   A.   Size Of Lots: Minimum lot sizes shall be the minimum for the applicable
zoning district of Taylorville or Christian County, except when a private
sewage system is necessary. When a private sewage disposal system will be used
for any length of time, lots shall be a minimum of twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet.
   B.   Lot Arrangement:
      1.   Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or
substantially radial to curved street lines. However, for purposes of solar
orientation, side lot lines need not be at right angles to straight street
lines or radial to curved street lines provided that side lot lines run within
twenty degrees (20°) east or west from due north to due south. If side lot
lines are being varied for solar orientation, layout and building setbacks
shall also be oriented with their long axis running from east to west, with a
possible variation of twenty degrees (20°) to the southwest or twenty degrees
(20°) to the southeast.
      2.   Each lot shall front upon a public street.
      3.   Flag lots shall be permitted only if the Plan Commission determines
that no public health and safety problems or additional costs or difficulties
providing Municipal services will result.
      4.   Through lots shall be permitted only when access is prohibited to
one street as described in subsection
11-7-3J of this Chapter.
      5.   All lots must contain sufficient buildable area.
   C.   Sizes Of Blocks: Blocks shall not be less than four hundred feet
(400'), nor more than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), in length
measured along the greatest dimension of the enclosed block area. In blocks
over eight hundred feet (800') in length, the Plan Commission may require one
or more public crosswalks with a right of way of not less than ten feet (10')
in width to extend entirely across the block at locations deemed necessary at
intervals not closer than four hundred feet (400').
   D.   Survey Monuments: All survey monuments shall be located and be made of
the appropriate material as required by State law.
   E.   Lot Grading:
      1.   Trees that cannot be saved, stumps, boulders, and other similar
items shall be removed.
      2.   All grading in the subdivision shall be related to the topography of
the surrounding area. All street embankments shall be raised at least one and
one-half feet (11/2') above the high water elevation.
      3.   All building lots shall be graded or have natural slopes that will
properly allow surface drainage to flow away from the principal structures to
be located on the lot.
      4.   Grading in the subdivision shall provide alternate drainageways for
the purpose of carrying water away from homes and preventing damage during
periods of heavy rainfall. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
11-7-5: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
   A.   During construction of public improvements, measures shall be taken to
control erosion and sedimentation to ensure that sediment will not be
transported from the site by a storm event of 2-year frequency or less. The
erosion and sediment control plan shall include measures to stabilize and
protect disturbed areas, keep runoff velocities low, retain sediment on site
and protect disturbed areas from runoff. The location, type and configuration
of controls such as swales, berms, dams, sediment basins and release mechanisms
shall be included with the construction plans.
   B.   Temporary or permanent soil stabilization measures, whichever is
applicable, shall be applied within fifteen (15) days after final grading to
all areas where the soil has been disturbed or the vegetative cover removed.
Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed preparation,
expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application and
kind and quantity of mulch for temporary or permanent vegetative control
measures shall be included with the construction plans. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
11-7-6: UTILITY EASEMENTS; LOCATION OF UTILITIES:
   A.   Utility Easements:
      1.   Utility easements shall be provided along front, rear or side lot
lines for the purpose of erecting and maintaining one or more of the following
facilities: storm sewers, sanitary sewers, surface drainage, gas mains,
underground electric lines, telephone lines, cable TV and such other utilities
reasonably required for an urban building.
      2.   Easements shall be minimum of fifteen feet (15') in width. A utility
may be located in the street right of way if the respective company so desires
and appropriate permits have been obtained.
      3.   Alternate locations for various utilities shall be decided upon by
the appropriate utility companies, subject to the approval of the City
Engineer. In no case shall streets, permanent buildings, or other manmade
improvements that obstruct surface drainage be placed on rear or side lot
easements.
      4.   It is the responsibility of the subdivider to notify all utility
companies in writing when the land to be developed has been graded in
accordance with the construction plans and is ready for installation of a given
utility.
   B.   Location Of Utilities:
      1.   Utilities (sewers, electric, water, gas and cable TV), whenever
possible, shall be located in the public right of way or front lot easement in
the following manner: water and electric lines shall be located on the south
and east sides; sanitary sewer and gas lines shall be located on the north and
west sides. In some cases, however, electric lines may also be located on the
north and west sides.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2395.png]
 
      2.   The placement of storm sewers or electric lines in the rear of a lot
is not acceptable unless circumstances determined by the City Engineer require
their placement in the rear, in which case the following easement diagrams
indicate placement:
         a.   Ten Foot Easements: When an easement will not include sanitary
sewer or surface drainage systems, a ten foot (10') easement width shall be
sufficient and the utilities shall be located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ad1e302d34fe178977ba5b4b12c49ac0d87f2a80/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2397.png]
 
         b.   Fifteen Foot Easements: When an easement will include either a
sanitary sewer system or a surface drainage system, but not both systems, a
fifteen foot (15') easement shall be required and the utilities shall be
located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ad1e302d34fe178977ba5b4b12c49ac0d87f2a80/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2399.png]
 
         c.   Twenty Foot Easements: When a utility easement will include both
a sanitary sewer system and a surface drainage system, a twenty foot (20')
easement shall be required and the utilities shall be located as follows:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/ad1e302d34fe178977ba5b4b12c49ac0d87f2a80/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2401.png]
 
         d.   Ten Foot Access Easement: When sanitary or storm sewers are
located in the rear of a lot, a ten foot (10') easement in the side yard shall
be required from the street right of way to each manhole or inlet. (Ord. 2831,
3-3-1998)
11-7-7: SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE:
   A.   All subdivisions shall be developed with adequate surface drainage.
Surface water drainage improvements shall consist of storm sewers and/or open
channels, inlets, catch basins and manholes designed and constructed to conform
with standards established by the city engineer and shall adequately drain the
area being developed including drainage from other areas which naturally drain
through the area being developed. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
In any event, and in all cases in which there is to be any connection to the
city's storm sewer main, the property owner (developer) shall pay the cost to
extend the storm sewer main the entire width or length (depending upon the
direction of such extension) of the subdivision to be serviced and/or for such
additional distance or direction along the subdivision to be serviced, as
determined by the city council from time to time, and shall be installed at the
maximum depth and at minimum grade as determined by the city engineer or the
street and sewer superintendent, so that such extension, after completion
thereof, immediately borders adjacent property in such a manner that future
extensions can directly be made to service adjacent property or properties.
(Ord. 3240, 8-15-2005)
   B.   If, as the result of subdivision development, surface water is
deposited in existing roadside ditches in quantities exceeding their capacity,
the developer shall improve the ditches and replace culverts as needed to
handle the flow.
   C.   Unless engineering evidence is presented to the city engineer
warranting exceptions, storm sewers which drain twenty (20) acres or less for
residential development shall be designed and constructed to meet the following
criteria:
Major streets: 10-year storm frequency
All other area: 5-year storm frequency
   D.   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to provide grade
control for rear lot drainage to each lot owner. Swales are not public works
which shall be dedicated to and accepted by the City; nevertheless, no
construction surety shall be fully released until the City Engineer has
approved the swales in the subdivision. The City Engineer will not approve any
swale until adequate turf and/or grass has been established at the elevations
set forth in the construction plans. Upon approval by the City Engineer, it
shall be the lot owner's responsibility to maintain the drainage course and to
keep it free from features that restrict natural drainage.
   E.   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all of the areas indicated on the preliminary
plan.
      1.   The controlled release of storm water runoff shall not exceed the
release or discharge rate which existed at the site prior to development. This
rate shall be known as the predeveloped discharge rate. In the case of multiple
discharge locations, no location shall discharge at a rate higher than the
predeveloped discharge rate for that location under any set of conditions. The
controlled release rate in any case shall not exceed the rated capacity of the
existing natural downstream outlet channel or storm sewer system as determined
by the City Engineer. The rate at which storm water runoff is transported into
a designated storage area may be as determined by the design engineer and is
unrestricted.
      2.   A natural or surface channel system shall be designed with adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all tributary upstream areas
through the development. This bypass channel shall be designed to carry the
peak rate of runoff from a 50-year storm assuming all storm sewers are blocked
and that the upstream areas are fully developed and have been saturated with
antecedent rainfall. No habitable structures shall be constructed within this
channel; however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements
shall be considered compatible primary uses.
      3.   Storm water runoff capacity of detention facilities and discharge
rates from such facilities shall be calculated by analyzing volume and rate of
runoff during pre- and post- development conditions for the 10-year and the
100-year recurrence intervals.
Storage capacity and discharge rates shall be based on the maximum calculated
volume and peak flow of storm waters, respectively.
Storage facilities shall be designed using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
method of calculating runoff discharge rate and total volume of storage. The
rational method of calculating runoff may be used for subdivisions less than
twenty (20) acres.
The storage volume shall be provided for the fully developed watershed that is
tributary to the area designated for detention purposes. The control structure
for discharge shall maintain the release rate at or below the rate established
in subsection E1 of this Section for all rainfall events of 100-year or less
frequency.
      4.   Detention reservoirs or dry bottom storm water storage areas shall
be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other
types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent
flooding. A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a
positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or other storm sewer facility with
adequate capacity. The combination of storage of the water from a 100-year
storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in
excess of seventy two (72) hours. Maximum depths of planned storm water storage
shall not exceed four feet (4') unless the existing natural ground contours and
other conditions lend themselves to greater storage depth, which shall be
approved by the City Engineer. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be 0.6% and
maximum slopes shall be ten percent (10%). Storage area side slopes shall be
kept as close to the natural land contours as practical and a ten percent (10%)
slope or less shall be used whenever possible. If slopes greater than ten
percent (10%) are necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions,
approval shall be obtained from the City Engineer, and suitable erosion control
shall be provided in addition to the protection required to ensure public
health and safety.
Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall
require little or no maintenance and/or attention for proper operation. Each
storm water storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow
in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year return frequency storm
occurs. The emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without
maintenance and/or attention and shall become part of the natural or surface
channel system described in a preceding paragraph. Hydraulic calculations shall
be submitted to substantiate all design features. Both outlet control
structures and emergency overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed
to fully protect the public health and safety. Storm water runoff velocities
shall be kept to a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outfall control
structure will not be permitted without complete protection for the public
safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and shall be
used only as a last resort when no other method is feasible.
      5.   Retention reservoir or wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be
designed with all of the items required for detention reservoir storage areas
except that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity
outlet shall not be required. However, the following additional conditions
shall be complied with:
         a.   Water surface area shall not exceed one-tenth (1/10) of the
tributary drainage area.
         b.   Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from
wave action.
         c.   Minimum normal water depth shall be six feet (6'). If fish are to
be used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of one-fourth (1/4) of the pond area
shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') deep.
         d.   Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond
level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline
maintenance.
         e.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface water
level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design
features.
         f.   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided,
if necessary. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these
aeration facilities shall be submitted with construction plans. Agreement for
the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be
prepared to the satisfaction of the City Engineer and Plan Commission.
      6.   Where developments form only a portion of the watershed or contain
portions of several watersheds, the requirements for providing storage shall be
based upon that portion of the area being developed as compared to the total
watershed tributary to the storage area. Compensating storage will be
acceptable whenever it is justified and feasible. As a watershed is developed
with a series of storm water storage facilities, due consideration will be
given for calculations of the allowable release rate and capacity of the
natural or surface channel system as described in subsection E2 of this
Section.
      7.   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash flood runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm
water runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or drainage
construction on the project site.
      8.   The construction of the storm water control systems shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide certain benefits to the surrounding
properties, negotiations for public participation in the cost of such
development may be feasible.
      9.   The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge
capacity to the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the storm water
runoff control system as provided in subsection E4 of this Section shall give
due consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for the
reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and/
or roofed over. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of
storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention
of existing topography are samples of possible recharge methods.
      10.   During the construction phase of land development, facilities shall
be provided by appropriate stock-pile design, to prevent the erosion and
washing away of the earth. Silting of downstream areas shall be prevented
through the strategic use of silting basins, sodding of runoff channels, and by
limiting the period of time during which the earth is stripped of vegetation.
      11.   Final engineering plans shall show complete details for all items
covered in this Section. Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm
water runoff control and storm sewers shall be submitted for review and
approval as part of the construction plan submittal or as part of the site plan
submittal for large scale developments. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-1998)
11-7-8: BACKFILL OVER UNDERGROUND UTILITIES:
   A.   Where an underground utility is to be placed in an area which has a
permanent type street or sidewalk surface, or upon which such a surface is to
be constructed within a period of one year, the backfill above the utility or
in case of sewers, above the top of the granular cradle, to the level of the
bottom of the permanent type pavement shall be made. This material will be in
all areas where utility trenches cross the pavement subgrade except in areas
which will be lime treated or areas where rock will be used to stabilize the
subgrade. The backfill shall be IDOT CA-6 or CA-7 crushed stone. Boiler slag
will not be permitted.
   B.   As an alternate, the use of "flowable fill" will be permitted. This mix
shall consist of a lean concrete mix with no less than fifty (50) pounds of
cement per cubic yard, two hundred (200) to six hundred (600) pounds of fly
ash, two thousand (2,000) to three thousand (3,000) pounds of fine aggregate
and thirty five (35) to sixty five (65) gallons of water. Minimum twenty eight
(28) day compressive strength shall not be less than 150 psi.
   C.   In areas not now subject to vehicular traffic, nor in the opinion of
the City Engineer likely to be within a period of one year, backfill may be
made with selected excavation material which is free from clods and stones,
provided such trench backfill is adequately jetted from the bottom up
completely filling the trench immediately after backfilling. (Ord. 2831, 3-3-
1998)
11-7-9: SEWAGE DISPOSAL:
   A.   Sanitary Sewers: When a subdivision is located within the service area
of a public sanitary sewerage system, sanitary sewers shall be constructed
throughout the entire subdivision in such a manner as to serve adequately each
building lot.
      1.   Public sanitary sewers shall be located in the north or west
boulevard (between curb and sidewalk) within the street right of way or in a
fifteen foot (15') easement behind the sidewalk within the house setback area.
Parallel sewer lines along the street may be used. Sanitary sewers shall not be
located in the rear yard.
      2.   Under no circumstances shall the entrance of storm water or
groundwater to the sanitary sewers be permitted.
      3.   All sanitary sewers collections and disposal systems shall comply
with the ordinances of the City, the Taylorville Sanitary District, and the
requirements of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
   B.   Private Sewage Disposal System: Where no public sanitary sewerage
system is available, individual sanitary disposal systems shall be installed to
service individual dwelling units according to conditions set forth in Section
 11-2-3 of this Title. These sanitary disposal systems shall be installed in
accordance with the latest revised edition of the Illinois private sewage
disposal licensing act and private sewage disposal code promulgated by the
Illinois department of public health and applicable ordinance of the city.
Sufficient area shall be provided to accommodate two (2) seepage fields. (Ord.
2831, 3-3-1998)
   C.   Connection To City's Sewer Main: In any event, and in all cases in
which there is to be any connection to the city's sanitary sewer main, the
property owner (developer) shall pay the cost to extend the sanitary sewer main
the entire width or length (depending on the direction of such extension) of
the property to be serviced and/or for such additional distance or direction
along the subdivision to be serviced, as determined by the city council from
time to time, and shall be installed at the maximum depth and at minimum grade
as determined by the city engineer or the street and sewer superintendent, so
that such extension, after completion thereof, immediately borders adjacent
property in such a manner that future extensions can directly be made to

12-1-9: PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER STANDARDS:
   A.   Public health standards must be met for all floodplain development. In
addition to the requirements of sections
12-1-6 and
12-1-7 of this chapter the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter.
      2.   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      3.   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      4.   New and replacement on site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other aboveground openings
located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight.
      5.   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet (3') above
the level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
   B.   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not
to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-
2011)
12-1-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the city of Taylorville shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-2011)
12-1-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the board of appeals for a
variance. The board of appeals shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the city council. The city
council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   Conditions For Granting Variance: No variance shall be granted unless
the applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   Notification: The board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of
section
12-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property, and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
12-1-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
12-1-6 and
12-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         b.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   D.   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed:
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
12-1-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
 12-1-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
12-1-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
12-1-7B of this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
12-1-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-2011)
12-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Taylorville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-2011)
12-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the city attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
city attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Taylorville shall make application to the circuit court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Taylorville shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   B.   The city attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The city attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of
the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate the
reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve
the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the board of appeals. Written notice of such hearing shall
be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of appeals shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Taylorville from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-
2011)
12-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Taylorville to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program
including: December 6, 1993. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance, easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 3507, 3-21-2011)
