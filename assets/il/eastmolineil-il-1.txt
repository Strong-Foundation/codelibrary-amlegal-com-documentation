and procedures for collection of unpaid fines and penalties, pursuant to
authority granted to all municipalities under 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/
1-2.2.
   (B)   Creation: There is hereby established an executive department of the
municipal government to be known as the East Moline ordinance enforcement

which provides for prosecution by an administrative agency of the city. This
section may be enforced through the use of an administrative hearing officer
system created by intergovernmental agreement between the city and such other

with applicable city code provisions and assessing costs upon finding a party
liable for the charged violation, except however, that in no event shall the
hearing officer have authority to impose a penalty of incarceration.
      2.   Prior to conducting administrative adjudication proceedings under
this section, the hearing officer shall have successfully completed a formal
training program which includes the following:

      2.   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of a
code violation, the city attorney may commence a proceeding in the circuit
court of Rock Island County for the purpose of obtaining a judgment on the
findings, decision, and order. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city
from consolidating multiple findings, decisions, and orders against a person in
such a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the city shall file a
certified copy of the findings, decision, and order, which shall be accompanied
by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings,
decision and order were issued in accordance with state law and the applicable
city ordinance. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any
method provided for by section 2-203 of the code of civil procedure or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of
fines, other sanctions, and costs imposed by the findings, decision, and order
does not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). If the court is
satisfied that the findings, decision, and order was entered in accordance with
the requirements of state law and the applicable city ordinance and that the
violation had an opportunity for a hearing and for judicial review:
         (a)   The court shall render judgment in favor of the city and against
the violator for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and order, plus
costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same
manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
         (b)   The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that
are requested by the city to enforce the order of the hearing officer to
correct a code violation.
      3.   In any case in which a hearing officer finds that a defendant has
failed to comply with a judgment ordering a defendant to correct a code
violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a code
violation, any expenses incurred by a municipality to enforce the judgment
including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court costs, and costs related to
property demolition or foreclosure after they are fixed by the hearing officer,
shall be a debt due and owing the municipality and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law and this ordinance.
      4.   A lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or
both of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the municipality
under this section, and after court entry of judgment as set forth in
subsection (J)2 of this section. The lien may be recorded and enforced in the
same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. No lien may be enforced under this section until it has been
recorded in the manner provided by article XII of the code of civil procedure
or by the uniform commercial code.
      5.   A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and
set a new hearing date upon a petition filed within twenty one (21) days after
the issuance of the order of default if the hearing officer determines that the
petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the municipality did not provide proper
service of process.

investigations and to require additional information and documents from persons
who may have violated the provisions of this ordinance.
         (d)   To compel the attendance of witnesses and to compel the

commission may elect to notify in writing the attorney designated by the
corporate authorities to prosecute such actions and request that the complaint
be adjudicated judicially. If the complaint is deemed not sufficient to allege
a violation or if there is no determination of probable cause, then the
commission shall send by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice to
the parties of the decision to dismiss the complaint, and that notice shall be
made public.

recessed hearing is concluded, the commission shall either: 1) dismiss the
complaint or 2) issue a recommendation for discipline to the alleged violator
and to the city administrator, or impose a fine upon the violator, or both. The
particular findings in the case, any recommendation for discipline, and any
fine imposed shall be a matter of public information.
         (f)   If the hearing was closed to the public, the respondent may file
a written demand for a public hearing on the complaint within seven (7)
business days after the issuance of the recommendation for discipline or
imposition of a fine, or both. The filing of the demand shall stay the
enforcement of the recommendation or fine. Within fourteen (14) days after
receiving the demand, the commission shall conduct a public hearing on the
complaint upon at least forty eight (48) hours' public notice of the hearing
and allow both parties the opportunity to present testimony and evidence.
Within seven (7) days thereafter, the commission shall publicly issue a final
recommendation to the alleged violator and to the city administrator or impose
a fine upon the violator, or both.
         (g)   If a complaint is filed during the sixty (60) days preceding the

1-19-18: SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY:
   (A)   Prohibition On Sexual Harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person’s sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
THE city of East Moline to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal
official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on
the basis ofsex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal
employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually
harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack
thereof.
   (B)   Definition Of Sexual Harassment. This policy adopts the definition of
sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently
defines sexual harassment as:
      1.   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      2.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking”
or “kissing” noises.
         (c)   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/Electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      3.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
   (C)   Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment.
      1.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his
position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      2.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)   Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
         (c)   Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
be filed within 300 days.
      3.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
      4.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment
Allegations.
      1.   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      2.   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      3.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      4.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member. State
agency, or other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation,
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member. State agency or other State
employee, or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      5.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
      6.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is
a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire,
to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
      7.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge - due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of
the alleged retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5- 65, may be subject
to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by
the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to
local ordinance, State law or Federal law. Each violation may constitute a
separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate
and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or
penalties imposed by a court of law or a State or Federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report.
      1.   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      2.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State’s Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 18-01, 1-16-2017)

(5%) of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or

penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty percent (20%) of the total tax due
for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be

penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 01-15, 5-21-2001)
1-30-12: ABATEMENT:

(3) years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for
the applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return
for the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if a taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 01-15, 5-21-2001)

Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the city
clerk's office. (Ord. 01-15, 5-21-2001)
1-30-17: LIENS FOR UNPAID TAXES:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
01-15, 5-21-2001)

2-5-3: POWERS OF BOARD:
The Board shall have jurisdiction in matters and shall have the specific and
general powers provided in the zoning title.
   (A)   Special Exceptions and Interpretation of Map: The Board shall have the
power to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of the zoning
title, requests or applications for special exceptions or of interpretation of
the Zoning Map or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the
Board is authorized to pass.
      1.   Special Exceptions: hi addition to permitting the special exceptions
heretofore specified in this report, the Board shall have authority to permit
the following:
         (a)   Nonconforming Uses: The substitution for a nonconforming use, by
another nonconforming use, if no structural alterations except those required
by law or ordinance are made; provided, however, that any use so substituted
shall be of the same or a more restricted classification.
         (b)   Temporary Uses and Permits:
            (1)   The temporary use of a building or premises in any district
for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by the
zoning title, provided that such use be of a true temporary nature and does not
involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit shall be granted in
the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than a twelve (12)
month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare.
            (2)   The temporary use of a building or premises in undeveloped
sections for a purpose that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by
the zoning title, provided that such structure or use is of a true temporary
nature, is promotive of or incidental to the development of such undeveloped
sections, and does not involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such
permit shall be granted in the form specified under subsection (A) 1(b)(1) of
this Section.
      2.   Authorize special uses requiring approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals: The Board may grant authorization of certain special uses in zoning
districts as provided in the zoning title. The Board shall give due regard to
the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures, and the
consistency therewith of the proposed use and development. Before authorizing a
use as a special exception, the Board shall determine whether the proposed
exception or use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or a nuisance
to the surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration,
dust and dirt, cinders, noxious gases, glare and heat, fire and safety hazards,
sewage wastes and pollution, transportation and traffic, aesthetic and
psychological effects. The Board may utilize and give recognition to those
performance standards which are available in model codes or ordinances, or have
been developed by planning, manufacturing, health, architectural and
engineering research organizations, and can be applied to the proposed use, to
assist it in reaching a fair and objective decision. Upon authorizing a special
use and/or exception, the Board may impose such requirements and conditions, in
addition to those expressly stipulated in the report for the particular special
use and/or exception, as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public interest.
      3.   Interpretation of Map: Where the street or lot layout actually on
the ground or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines indicated on
the Zoning Map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of the zoning title for the particular section or district
in question.
   (B)   Administrative Review And Variances: The Board of Appeals also shall
have the power:
      1.   Administrative Review: To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the applicant that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, grant or refusal made by the building inspector in the enforcement of
the provisions of the zoning title.
      2.   Variances: To authorize on appeal in specific cases such variance
from the terms of the zoning title as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where owing to a special condition, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of the zoning title will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that
the spirit of the zoning title shall be observed and substantial justice done,
as follows:
         (a)   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape
of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of the zoning title,
or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary and
exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or
development of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in
question, the literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning title would
result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and
undue hardship upon the owner of such property, unnecessary to carry out the
spirit and purpose of the zoning title, the Board shall have the power to
authorize, upon appeal, a variance from such strict application, so as to
relieve such difficulties or hardships, and so that the spirit and purpose of
the zoning title shall be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing
a variance the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location,
character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it
may deem advisable in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of the
zoning title.
         (b)   No such variance in the provisions or requirements of the zoning
title shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds beyond reasonable
doubt that all of the following conditions exist:
            (1)   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the property in question or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or class of uses in
the same zoning district.
            (2)   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the vicinity.
            (3)   That the authorizing of such variance will not be of
substantial detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the
purposes of the zoning title or the public interest.
         (c)   No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a
nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation, under an amendment of the zoning title, for such conditions or
situations.
         (d)   The Board shall have no power to authorize a variance for the
establishment of a nonconforming use where none previously existed.
      3.   Action Of Board: In exercising its powers, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes and of the
zoning title, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as, in the Board’s opinion, ought to be
made, and to the end has all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is
taken.
   (C)   Judicial Review: All final administrative decisions of the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions
of the “Administrative Review Act”, approved May 8, 1945, and all amendments
and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 18-08,

shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the
charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further, that
if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be
obligated to remit such tax.
      3.   Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the
purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the
electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to
such gross charge an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the tax they collect

tax is collected or is required to be collected under subsection (C) of this
Section.

the purchaser or is excused from collecting the tax under subsection (E) of
this Section, then the purchaser shall file a return in a form prescribed by
the City and pay the tax directly to the City on or before the last day of the
month following the month during which the electricity is used or consumed.
   (E)   Resales:

Finance and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity
and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially
nontaxable as a sale for resale.
      2.   If a person who receives electricity in the City claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Director of
Finance for a resale number. The application shall state facts showing why it
is not liable for the tax imposed by this Section on any purchases of
electricity and shall furnish such additional information as the Director of
Finance may reasonably require.
      3.   Upon approval of the application, the Director of Finance shall
assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the
applicant.
      4.   The Director of Finance may cancel the resale number of any person
if the person fails to pay any tax payable under this Section for electricity
used or consumed by the person, or if the number: a) was obtained through
misrepresentation, or b) is no longer necessary because the person has
discontinued making resales.
      5.   (a) If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or
consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by
this Section directly to the City pursuant to subsection (D)2 of this Section
on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall
collect the tax pursuant to subsection (C) of this Section and remit the tax
pursuant to subsection (D)1 of this Section on the amount of electricity
delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.
         (b)   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an
active resale number and complying with all other conditions of this Section
shall be excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the
electricity delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the
City the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and such other
information that the City may reasonably require.

pay the tax imposed by this amendment shall keep accurate books and records of

   (A)   Signs Permitted Upon Approval: A sign or signs pertaining to a
nonconforming use on the premises may be permitted upon approval by the Board
of Zoning Appeals only after all of the following conditions are satisfied, and
only if a sign would be allowed on the premises if said use were properly
zoned.
      1.   It is the intent of this Section to allow nonconforming uses to have
one sign for the purpose of identification but because of the nature of
nonconforming uses they shall be more restricted than those permitted for
permitted uses. All signs under this Section shall comply with all other
applicable sections of this Ordinance.
      2.   Signs on nonconforming uses may be replaced only with signs of the
same size or smaller, at the same location on the building or premises (or in a

4-9-12: REMOVAL OF SIGNS:
It is the intent of this Section to recognize that the eventual elimination, as
expeditiously as it is reasonable, of existing signs that are not in conformity
with the provisions of this Ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety
and welfare as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the
provisions of this Ordinance. It is also the intent of this Section that any
elimination of nonconforming, obsolete, unsafe and unlawful signs shall be
affected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private
rights.
   (A)   Prohibited Signs: All signs prohibited by Section

as long as maintenance does not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the
replacement value of the sign at any one time.

      4.   Reestablished after damage or destruction if the estimated expense
of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the appraised replacement cost
as determined by the Building Inspector.

   (C)   Unsafe And Unlawful Signs: If the Building Inspector finds that any
sign regulated herein is structurally unsafe; constitutes a hazard to safety or
health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or abandonment; is
not kept in good repair; is capable of causing electrical shocks to persons
likely to come in contact with it; or is unlawfully installed, erected, or
maintained, he or she shall give written notice to the permittee and/or owner
thereof. If the permittee and/or owner fails to remove or alter the structure
so as to comply with the standard herein set forth within ten (10) days after
such notice, said sign shall be removed or altered to comply by the Building
Inspector at the expense of the permittee or owner of the property upon which
it is located. (Ord. 86-23, 12-1-1986)

at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement, was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,

   (A)   Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
   (B)   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.

state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   (B)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 10-05, 3-1-2010)

4-12-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this ordinance place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to East Moline zoning board of
appeals for a variance. The East Moline zoning board of appeals shall review
the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to
the East Moline city council. The East Moline city council may attach such
conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the
intent of this ordinance.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.

public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The East Moline zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in
writing that a variance from the requirements of the building protection
standards of section
4-12-7 of this chapter which would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
4-12-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
4-12-6 and
4-12-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 10-05, 3-1-2010)
4-12-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This ordinance does not create liability on the part
of the city of East Moline or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damage that results from proper reliance on this ordinance or any
administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 10-05, 3-1-2010)
4-12-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this ordinance. Upon due investigation, the director of
engineering may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this
ordinance exists. The director of engineering shall notify the owner in writing
of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of East Moline shall make application to the circuit court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this ordinance or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this ordinance.
      2.   Any person who violates this ordinance shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of East Moline shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   The director of engineering shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The director of engineering is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the East Moline zoning board of appeals. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the East Moline zoning board
of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of East Moline from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 10-05, 3-1-
2010)
4-12-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This ordinance repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the East Moline
city council to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance
program including: ordinance 02-30, dated September 3, 2002. However, this
ordinance does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to
achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this ordinance repeal, abrogate,
or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this
ordinance and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions
conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail. (Ord. 10-05, 3-1-2010)

      3.   Each resident of a dwelling unit who is present within that dwelling
unit or upon the premises of that dwelling unit when such sound is amplified or
generated shall be responsible for the generation of that sound or noise
pursuant to the provisions of this section. However it shall be a specific
defense to a violation of this provision that a resident of the dwelling unit
attempted to remedy the situated and was precluded from doing so or was
incapacitated or otherwise unable to remedy the situation.
      4.   Each business proprietor and each business manager who is present
upon the premises of the business from which sound is amplified or generated

ambient sound.

level means the sound level of all-encompassing sound associated with a given
environment, being usually a composite of sound from many or differing sources
generated from a single parcel or property or a single commercial activity.

facility as an integral part of the licensed premises may provide, as part of

broadcasts at the outdoor facility on Friday, Saturday and holidays (evenings
prior to New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,

regulated by the applicable liquor license if, and only if the ambient sound
level does not exceed 50 decibels on the C weighting scale (dBC) at the
property lines of the licensed premises.
      6.   The provisions of this section do not apply to sounds generated by
authorized emergency vehicles, to vehicle horns sounded as a danger warning
signal, to audible police alarm devices, to fire alarms or to sound made on

body.

compactor or the capacity to raise and dump dumpsters in any area zoned for
residential or business uses between the hours of 10:00 PM and 6:00 AM, and no
employer shall fail to prevent its employee from violating this subsection

variance of the provisions of subsections (b) of this section for Business
District locations. Possession of a valid variance shall be a specific defense
to any charge under subsection (b) of this section if the act complained of was
within the variance granted. The City Administrator may grant all or a part of
any requested variance and may place such conditions upon any variance granted
as are reasonably suited to limit the harmful effects of the variance. The
variances shall be granted only if the applicant can demonstrate to the City
Administrator’s satisfaction:

residential use that the noise of trash collection will not disturb anyone in
their residence, including without limitation, hotel and motel accommodations;
or
         (b)   That the location in question cannot feasibly be serviced during
the permitted hours and that the variance is the least necessary to permit
trash collection while still assuring nearby residents reasonable nocturnal
quiet.

a. Operate any type of vehicle, machine or device;

consistently make sound in excess of the level specified in this section. For
the purposes of this section, “Consistently” means a continuous noise level

specified does not constitute a violation of this section.
      2.   Sound from a vehicular source located on private property or within
the public right-of- way shall not exceed 80 decibels on the C weighting scale
(dBC), except that the sound from a vehicle with a manufacturer’s gross weight
rating of 10,000 pounds and above operated on a prescribed truck route at all
time or elsewhere within the City during the hours of 6:00AM to 6:00PM on
Monday through Saturday may exceed 80 dBC but may not exceed 100 dBC. The sound
shall be measured at a distance of at least 25 feet from the vehicle located
within the public right-of-way.

vehicular source located within the public right-of-way, shall not exceed 75
dBC on the weighting scale (dBC).

on the permit.

on public infrastructure is exempt from this ordinance.

maintenance or repair of property, (e.g., lawn mowers, snowblowers, weed
trimmers, etc.) is exempt from this ordinance.
         (d)   Sound from a racetrack permitted by the Mayor or City Council is
exempt from this ordinance.
         (e)   Under no circumstances shall amplified sound be considered as
construction work activity.

            (1)   Originating from private property shall be measured at or
outside the property line of the property on which the sound source is located;

property so long as the measurement is taken at least 25 feet from the source,
or it may be measured at or outside the property line of the property on which

administrative hearing shall be held promptly within not less than five (5)
working days nor more than fifteen (15) working days following service of the
notice upon the owner or keeper of the dog. The service of a notice to appear

the clock for the administrative hearing process.
   (E)   Conduct Of Hearing: The administrative hearing shall be open to the
public and shall be recorded by a tape recorder, stenographer, or other
reliable means. The chief of police shall serve as the hearing officer. The
hearing officer may admit into evidence all relevant evidence, including
incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, and live testimony. The
hearing officer shall determine, based upon a preponderance of the evidence,
whether or not the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. If the notice of
the administrative hearing charged that the dog is vicious but does not charge
that the dog is dangerous, the hearing officer may nevertheless determine that
the dog is dangerous rather than vicious, if the evidence so warrants.

in writing of the hearing officer's determination either personally or by first
class mail to the owner's or keeper's last known address.

fees that are attributable solely to the pendency of the administrative hearing
but shall be required to pay all other fees.
      2.   If the hearing officer determines that the dog is dangerous, the
owner or keeper may redeem the dog, subject to the requirements of section
6-4-2.7 of this chapter.
      3.   If the hearing officer determines that the dog is vicious, the
animal may not be redeemed, and the notice of determination shall also state

the notice unless the owner or keeper requests a stay of ten (10) working days
during which to file a complaint for court review of the hearing officer's
determination pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois administrative review
law, 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., and amendments thereto.
   (G)   Failure To Appear: If the dog's owner or keeper cannot be found or
fails to appear in person or by legal counsel for the administrative hearing,
the hearing officer shall make a determination by default, without need of any
testimony or other evidence, that the dog is vicious or dangerous, as well as
abandoned, and the dog shall be euthanized without further notice to the owner
or keeper.
   (H)   Euthanasia: Upon the hearing officer's determination that the dog is
vicious, it shall be euthanized after five (5) working days from the date of
the notice of determination to the owner or keeper, unless the owner or keeper
within that time period delivers to the office of the chief of police a request
to stay the euthanasia for a period of ten (10) working days for the purpose of
filing a complaint for court review of the hearing officer's determination
pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois administrative review law, 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., and amendments thereto. If, at the
end of that period, the city has not received notice that a complaint has been
filed, the dog shall be euthanized without further notice to the owner or
keeper.
   (I)   Appeal: Any person aggrieved by the hearing officer's decision may
appeal to the circuit court pursuant to the provisions of the Illinois
administrative review law, 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., and
amendments thereto. (Ord. 06-21, 9-18-2006)

When the Chief of Police of the City of East Moline receives two (2) or more
police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a

may:
   (A)   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger
of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following
information:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
      2.   A statement that the Chief of Police has information that the
property may be chronic nuisance property, with a concise description of the
nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The Chief of Police
shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action
that the Chief of Police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise
to the violation.
      3.   Demand that the person in charge respond to the Chief of Police
within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities.
   (B)   After complying with the notification procedures described herein when
the Chief of Police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of a
third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the
property has become a chronic nuisance property, the Chief of Police shall:
      1.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been
determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   The street address or legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
         (b)   A statement that the Chief of Police has determined the property
to be chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance
activities leading to his/her findings.
         (c)   Demand that the person in charge respond within ten (10) days to
the Chief of Police and propose a course of action that the Chief of Police
agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation.
         (d)   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at
the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such
other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the
determination by the Chief of Police.
         (e)   A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such
address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is
located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons
are different than the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or
by first class mail, postage prepaid.
         (f)   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after
ten (10) days have elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the
person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the Chief of
Police.
         (g)   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property
may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this Chapter.
      2.   After the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the City pursuant to this Chapter, a person in charge stipulates
with the Chief of Police that the person in charge will pursue a course of
action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the
violation. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of
the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within
thirty (30) days, the Chief of Police shall request authorization for the
Corporation Counsel to commence a legal proceeding to abate the nuisance.
      3.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
Chief of Police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other
documentation which supports legal proceedings, to the Corporation Counsel.
   (C)   When a person in charge makes a response to the Chief of Police as
required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance
activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or ordered for any
other purpose. (Ord. 97-37, 7-21-1997)
6-11-6: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION, BURDEN OF PROOF:
   (A)   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the City
shall have the initial burden of showing by preponderance of the evidence that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (C)   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors if they need be found appropriate,
and shall cite those found applicable.

mitigate or correct the problem at the property.

correct the condition. (Ord. 97-37, 7-21-1997)
6-11-7: EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES:
   (A)   In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the City may apply to the court for
such interim relief as is deemed by the Chief of Police to be appropriate. In
such an event, the notification provision set forth in Section
6-11-5 of this Chapter need not be complied with, however, the City shall make
a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   (B)   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property" as defined in this Chapter, the court may order the remedy
set out above. In addition, in the event that it also finds the person in
charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting
or violating this Chapter and permitted the activities to occur, the court may
assess a civil fine as provided above.
   (C)   The court may authorize the City of East Moline to physically secure
the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so
within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is
authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the City to
effect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If
used herein "costs" mean these costs actually incurred by the City for the
physical securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs.
   (D)   The City of East Moline Department of Public Works effecting the
closure shall prepare a statement of cost and the City of East Moline shall
thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection
of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in
said amount may be recorded against said property.
   (E)   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof by the City.
   (F)   A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those
are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into
the property, after either:
      1.   The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the
Police Chief's determination as described above.
      2.   Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this Section.
      3.   Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil
penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the
City. (Ord. 97-37, 7-21-1997)

If any provision of this Ordinance or its application, or any person or
circumstances held to be invalid for any reason, the remainder of said
application or its provisions to the other persons or circumstance shall not be
in any way affected. (Ord. 97-37, 7-21-1997)

authorized by the Plumbing Inspector. The stop box used shall be of a design
approved by the Plumbing Inspector or Director Of Maintenance Services and must
have an unobstructed opening at least one inch (1") in diameter and fitted with

shutoff, type to be designated by the City's Plumbing Inspector.
   (E)   Conformance: Owners of premises having water services which do not
have separate curb boxes and stops for each building and or address, or which
otherwise do not conform to the requirements in this Ordinance at the time of
its passage shall be required to put in such curb box stops or make such other
changes as are necessary to conform to these requirements when so instructed by
the Plumbing Inspector.
   (F)   Control: The outside shutoff shall be under the sole control of the
City Water and Sewer Department and no person except an employee or person
specially authorized by the City Water and Sewer Department shall open the
cover of such box, or turn on or off water. Provided, however, that licensed
and bonded plumbers may turn on or off water for testing plumbing or making
repairs, but whenever so used the shutoff must be left closed if found closed,
and open if found open by the plumber who uses it.

flush with the surrounding ground or sidewalk surface, and must be visible from
the sidewalk. The valves, curb box and shutoff must be kept in good condition
and ready for use at all times by the property owner. Should the property owner
neglect to maintain such valves, curb box stop and shutoff in proper condition,
and if the curb box stop is found to be out of repair at any time, the City
Water Department shall have the right to clean or repair the same when needed
upon giving notice, and charge the cost thereof to the owner, and if payment is
refused may turn off the water in the service until the same is paid. The City
will not be responsible for any damage due to the breaking of a service or curb
box stop, done while setting, or repairing a water meter.

(41/2') below the established grade, except in sandy soil formation in which
case the Plumbing Inspector may require pipes to be laid to a depth of at least
five feet (5') below the established grade. (Ord. 99-10, 3-15-1999)

more of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling,
and boiler blowdown wastewater);
         (b)   Contributes a process waste stream which makes up five percent
(5%) or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the
POTW treatment plant; or
         (c)   Is designated as such by the city of East Moline on the basis
that it has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation
or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
      3.   The city of East Moline may determine that an industrial user is
subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a nonsignificant categorical
industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the
industrial user never discharges more than one hundred (100) gallons per day
(gpd) of total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling

      1.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with this section.
      2.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the superintendent
may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharge per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
      3.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the superintendent
shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   (C)   State Pretreatment Standards: State pretreatment standards found in
title 35, environmental protection, subtitle C, water pollution, subpart B;

The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the
POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless
indicated otherwise. The superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition
to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations above.
Wastewater containing five (5) day BOD greater than two hundred milligrams per
liter (200 mg/l), or total suspended solids in excess of two hundred fifty
milligrams per liter (250 mg/l), may be permitted by specific, written
agreement with the city, upon determination by the city that these alternative
limits will not cause adverse effect on the city's facilities or operations,
which agreement to discharge such BOD or TSS may provide for special charges,
payments or provisions for treating and testing equipment.
Best management practices (BMPs) may be incorporated into individual discharge
permits.
   (E)   City Of East Moline's Right Of Revision: The city of East Moline
reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge
permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
   (F)   Dilution: No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)
8-9-3: PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER:
   (A)   Pretreatment Facilities: Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this ordinance and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in subsection
8-9-2(A) of this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the
state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be
acceptable to the superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the city of East Moline under the provisions of this
ordinance.
   (B)   Additional Pretreatment Measures:
      1.   Whenever deemed necessary, the superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
      2.   The superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      3.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the superintendent and shall be
so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by
the user at their expense.
      4.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (C)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans: At least once every two (2)
years, the superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial
user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The superintendent may
require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection
8-9-6(F) of this chapter; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (D)   Hauled Wastewater:
      1.   Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the superintendent, and at such times as are established by the
superintendent. Such waste shall not violate section
8-9-2 of this chapter or any other requirements established by the city of East
Moline. The superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain
wastewater discharge permits.
      2.   All procedures for discharging, for cleanliness and for general
sanitary operation of city property as prescribed by the city of East Moline
shall be strictly adhered to by all wastewater haulers delivering wastewater to
the city dumping station.
      3.   The source or sources of all liquid wastes being hauled to the POTW
treatment plant shall be properly documented using a manifest system.
      4.   Wastewater from a domestic level user shall not be mixed with
wastewater from an industrial user (nondomestic). Vehicles hauling wastewater
from an industrial user (nondomestic) shall not be used to haul wastewater from
a domestic level user for disposal at the POTW unless thoroughly cleaned
between hauls.
      5.   In addition to remedies available to the city set forth elsewhere in
this ordinance, failure of a wastewater hauler to comply with the provisions of
this section shall be grounds for revocation of the hauler's discharge
privilege.
      6.   Wastewater hauled from an industrial user shall provide the city
with a statement documenting significant constituents of the wastewater and
their concentrations, which may include analysis such as TCLP.
      7.   The superintendent may require industrial waste haulers and/or
generators to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent also may
prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled
industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this ordinance.
      8.   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior
consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards.
      9.   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number (if applicable), truck identification,
names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of
waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. (Ord. 09-08, 4-
20-2009)

8-9-6: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Baseline Monitoring Reports:
      1.   Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on
a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
POTW shall submit to the superintendent a report which contains the information
listed in subsection (A)2 of this section. At least ninety (90) days prior to
commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the superintendent a report which contains the
information listed in subsection (A)2 of this section. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
      2.   Users described above shall submit the information set forth below:
         (a)   Information Required: All information required in subsections
8-9-4(E)1(a)(1), (E)1(b), (E)1(c)(1) and (E)1(f) of this chapter.
         (b)   Measurement Of Pollutants:
            (1)   The user shall provide the information required in
subsections
8-9-4(E)1(g)(1) through (E)1(g)(4) of this chapter.
            (2)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection.
            (3)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting
data shall be submitted to the control authority;
            (4)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
subsection (J) of this section;
            (5)   The superintendent may allow the submission of a baseline
report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment
measures;
            (6)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
         (c)   Compliance Certification: A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in subsection
8-9-1(D) of this chapter and certified by a qualified professional, indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
         (d)   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established
for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to
this subsection must meet the requirements set out in subsection (B) of this
section.
         (e)   Signature And Report Certification: All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with subsection (N)1 of this section
and signed by an authorized representative as defined in subsection
8-9-1(D) of this chapter.
   (B)   Compliance Schedule Progress Reports: The following conditions shall
apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection (A)2(d) of this
section:
      1.   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      2.   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      3.   The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      4.   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the superintendent.
   (C)   Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline:
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
superintendent a report containing the information described in subsections
8-9-4(E)1(f) and (E)1(g) of this chapter and subsection (A)2(b) of this
section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in subsection
8-9-2(B) of this chapter or 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a
reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other users
subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate
sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection (N)1 of this section. All sampling will be done in
conformance with subsection (K) of this section.
   (D)   Periodic Compliance Reports:
      1.   Except as specified in subsection (D)3 of this section, all
significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the
superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (see permit for
submission month), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution preventative alternative, the user must
submit documentation required by the superintendent or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
      2.   The city may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user (see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)). This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See subsection
8-9-4(E)1(h) of this chapter.
         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with subsection
8-9-1(D) of this chapter, and include the certification statement in subsection
(N)1 of this section (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
         (e)   Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR 403 part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the superintendent must be
included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for waiver must be
maintained by the superintendent for three (3) years after expiration of the
waiver.
         (g)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user's permit by the superintendent, the industrial user must certify on each
report with the statement in subsection (N)3 of this section, that there has
been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the
industrial user.
         (h)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's
operations, the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements
of subsection (D)1 of this section, or other more frequent monitoring
requirements imposed by the superintendent, and notify the superintendent.
         (i)   This certification does not supersede certification processed
and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
      3.   The city of East Moline may reduce the requirement for periodic
compliance reports (see subsection (D)1 of this section [40 CFR 403.12(e)(1)])
to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required
more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the EPA/state IEPA, where
the industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of
the following:
         (a)   Five thousand (5,000) gallons per day.
         (b)   Two thousand five hundred milligrams per liter (2,500 mg/l) per
day BOD and SS combined.
         (c)   One hundred (100) of one percent (1%) of any pollutant regulated
by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard or for any pollutant
regulated for an approved local limit developed in accordance with subsection
8-9-2(D) of this chapter.
Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in the last
two (2) years been in significant noncompliance, as defined in section
8-9-8 of this chapter. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an
industrial user with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that, in the opinion of the superintendent,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in
data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
      4.   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with subsection (N)1 of this section.
      5.   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times, at user's expense. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility
in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
      6.   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the superintendent, using the procedures prescribed
in subsection (K) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be
included in the report.
   (E)   Reports Of Changed Conditions: Each user must notify the
superintendent of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least
thirty (30) days before the change.
      1.   The superintendent may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection
8-9-4(E) of this chapter.
      2.   The superintendent may issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit under subsection
8-9-4(G) of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under subsection
8-9-5(D) of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.
   (F)   Reports Of Potential Problems:
      1.   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or a slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
      2.   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this
ordinance.
      3.   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in subsection (F)1 of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (G)   Reports From Unpermitted Users: All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
superintendent as the superintendent may require.
   (H)   Notice Of Violation/Repeat Sampling And Reporting: If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the superintendent within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if
the superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if
the superintendent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the
user receives the results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
   (I)   Notification Of The Discharge Of Hazardous Waste:
      1.   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to
the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the
following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste
discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted
under subsection (E) of this section. The notification requirement in this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
subsections (A), (C) and (D) of this section.
      2.   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (I)1 of
this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
      3.   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
superintendent, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      4.   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      5.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
   (J)   Analytical Requirements: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
   (K)   Sample Collection: Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      1.   Except as indicated in subsections (K)2 and (K)3 of this section,
the user must collect wastewater samples using twenty four (24) hour flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the superintendent. Where time
proportional composite or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a twenty four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
      2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      3.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety
(90) day compliance reports required in subsections (A) and (C) of this section
(40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for
pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by
subsection (D) of this section (40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h)), the industrial user
is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (L)   Date Of Receipt Of Reports: Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States postal
service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
   (M)   Recordkeeping: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
ordinance shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this ordinance and any additional records of information obtained pursuant
to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city of East Moline, or where the user has been specifically notified of
a longer retention period by the superintendent.
   (N)   Certification Statements:
      1.   Certification Of Permit Applications, User Reports And Initial
Monitoring Waiver: The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by user submitting permit applications in accordance with
subsection
8-9-4(F) of this chapter; user submitting baseline monitoring reports under

or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations.
      2.   Annual Certification For Nonsignificant Categorical Industrial
Users: A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial user
by the superintendent pursuant to subsections
8-9-1(D) and
8-9-4(F)3 of this chapter must annually submit the following certification
statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in subsection
8-9-1(D) of this chapter. This certification must accompany an alternative
report required by the superintendent.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the categorical Pretreatment Standards under 40 CFR [applicable
classification], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief that
during the period from         ,          to         ,          [months, days,
year]:
(a) The facility described as             [facility name] met the definition of
a Non-Significant Categorical Industrial User as described in subsection
8-9-1(D) of the city code;
(b) The facility complied with all applicable Pretreatment Standards and
requirements during this reporting period; and (c) the facility never
discharged more than 100 gallons of total categorical wastewater on any given
day during this reporting periods.
This compliance certification is based on the following information.
      3.   Certification Of Pollutants Not Present: Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on subsection (D)2 of this section must certify on each
report with the following statement that there has been no increase in the
pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the user:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing
compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR        [applicable
National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of        [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since
filing of the last periodic report under subsection
8-9-6(D)1 of the city code.
(Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)
8-9-7: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   (A)   Right Of Entry; Inspection And Sampling: The superintendent shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any individual wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the
superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties.
      1.   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      2.   The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      3.   The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated at the city's discretion, to ensure their accuracy.
      4.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      5.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance.
   (B)   Search Warrants: If the superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program of the city of East Moline designed to
verify compliance with this ordinance or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
then the superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Rock
Island circuit court of the county of Rock Island, Rock Island, Illinois.
   (C)   Confidential Information: Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the
superintendent's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the superintendent, that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data"
as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 09-08, 4-20-
2009)
8-9-8: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users
which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term
"significant noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial
users (or any other industrial user that violates subsections (C), (D) or (H)
of this section) and shall mean:
   (A)   "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined herein as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in section
8-9-2 of this chapter;
   (B)   "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined herein as those
in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken
for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by section
8-9-2 of this chapter multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS,
fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (C)   Any other discharge violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by section
8-9-2 of this chapter (daily maximum, long term average, instantaneous limit,
or narrative standard) that the superintendent determines has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (D)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the superintendent's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (E)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   (F)   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (G)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (H)   Any other violation(s) which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the superintendent determines will adversely affect
the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 09-08,
4-20-2009)
8-9-9: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   (A)   Notification Of Violation: When the superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Consent Orders: The superintendent may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
subsections (D) and (E) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (C)   Show Cause Hearing: The superintendent may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and
show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten (10) days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
   (D)   Compliance Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance
within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (E)   Cease And Desist Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (F)   Administrative Fines:
      1.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00). Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day
basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      2.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after seventeen (17)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of zero percent
(0%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      3.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
      4.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (G)   Emergency Suspensions: The superintendent may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      1.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings in subsection (H) of this section are
initiated against the user.
      2.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under subsection (C) or (H) of this section.
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this subsection.
   (H)   Termination Of Discharge: In addition to the provisions in subsection
8-9-5(F) of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
      1.   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      2.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      3.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      4.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      5.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in section
8-9-2 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (C) of this section why
the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user. (Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)
8-9-10: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
   (A)   Injunctive Relief: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the Rock
Island County circuit court, through the city of East Moline's attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on
activities of the user. The superintendent may also seek such other action as
is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for
the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
   (B)   Civil Penalties:
      1.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to
the city of East Moline for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term
average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period
of the violation.
      2.   The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city of East Moline.
      3.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      4.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (C)   Criminal Prosecution:
      1.   A user who wilfully or negligently violates any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for
not more than six (6) months, per violation, or both.
      2.   A user who wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into the
POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00), or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six (6)
months, per violation, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other
cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state
law.
      3.   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation
filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this ordinance, individual
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or
imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
      4.   In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a
fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day,
or imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
   (D)   Remedies Nonexclusive: The remedies provided for in this ordinance are
not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the city of East Moline's
enforcement response plan. However, the superintendent may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the superintendent is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user. (Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)
8-9-11: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
   (A)   Performance Bonds: The superintendent may decline to issue or reissue
a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this ordinance, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city of East Moline,
in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the superintendent to be necessary
to achieve consistent compliance.
   (B)   Water Supply Severance: Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (C)   Public Nuisances: A violation of any provision of this ordinance, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent. Any person(s)
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city of
East Moline, sections
7-1-6 through
7-1-9 of this code, governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city of
East Moline for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said
nuisance.
   (D)   Contractor Listing: Users which have not achieved compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive
a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the city of East
Moline. Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the city of
East Moline held by a user found to be in significant noncompliance with
pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the discretion of
the superintendent. (Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)
8-9-12: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
   (A)   Upset:
      1.   For the purposes of this subsection, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      2.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of subsection (A)3 of this section are met.
      3.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to the
superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days:
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            (3)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      4.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      5.   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      6.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited Discharge Standards: A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in subsection
8-9-2(A)1 of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsections
8-9-2(A)2(c) through (A)2(g), and (A)2(i) through (A)2(r) of this chapter if it
can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge,
alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass-
through or interference and that either:
      1.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through
or interference; or
      2.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city of East Moline was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and
in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
   (C)   Bypass:
      1.   For the purposes of this subsection:
   BYPASS: The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE: Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic
loss caused by delays in production.
      2.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of subsections (C)3 and (C)4 of this section.
      3.   (a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The superintendent may waive the written
report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty four (24) hours.
      4.   (a) Bypass is prohibited, and the superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            (3)   The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C)3
of this section.
         (b)   The superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the superintendent determines that it will
meet the three (3) conditions listed in subsection (C)4(a) of this section.
(Ord. 09-08, 4-20-2009)

carrying culinary oil, grease, or fats shall be separate from those carrying
sanitary waste. Grease interceptors are the only acceptable pretreatment method
for such removal of grease, fats, culinary oils of animal or vegetable origin
or other similar waste. The use of bacterial enzymes or other biological or
chemical additions is not an approved method. Grease interceptors shall be
maintained on a periodic basis, as directed by the health department, plumbing
inspector, or pretreatment coordinator.

8-12-5: PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
   (A)   No person shall release or cause to be released into the storm
drainage system any discharge that is not composed entirely of uncontaminated
storm water, except as allowed in the listed exemptions of this chapter. Common
prohibited storm water contaminants include trash, yard waste, stones, earth,
concrete, wood, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products,
cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, and sediment.
   (B)   Notwithstanding the listed exemptions of this chapter, any discharge
shall be prohibited by this section if the discharge in question has been
determined by the director of engineering to be a source of pollutants to the
storm drainage system.
   (C)   The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drainage system, are prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. It is the intention of the
city council that this section shall apply retroactively.
   (D)   No person shall connect a line conveying sanitary sewage, domestic
sewage or industrial waste, to the storm drainage system, or allow such a
connection to or be made to continue.
   (E)   Surface water shall be allowed to travel its natural or preregulation
course unless changes are allowed by means of a drainage permit or drainage
plans approved by the director of engineering. It shall be unlawful for any
person to force surface water off that person's property and onto a neighboring
property or to prevent surface water which would have entered that person's
property from doing so without approval granted by a drainage permit.
   (F)   No buildings or permanent structures, including impervious surfaces,
may be placed wholly or in part within an easement that has been granted for
access to drainage facilities of any type, including agricultural drainage
conduit, without the written approval of the director of engineering; provided,
however, streets, sidewalks and driveways may be allowed to cross easements by
the shortest possible route, provided that the purpose of the easement is
maintained and all other requirements are met.
   (G)   It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or maintain any
obstruction within a watercourse or drainage facility of any type, except as
may be specifically authorized by this chapter.
   (H)   No person shall interfere with BMPs implemented pursuant to this
chapter.
   (I)   No owner or occupant of property abutting a public right of way, or
any other person acting as agent for either, shall discharge water originating
from sumps, sump pits, sump pumps, footing drains, or any other reservoir
serving as a drain or receptacle for water onto a street, alley, or other
public right of way so as to cause a hazardous accumulation of water or ice
upon said right of way. It should be noted that many areas in and around the
city of East Moline have a high ground water table which may necessitate
routine pumping from a sump pit or other similar dewatering facility. To ensure
sump pump discharge does not create a hazardous condition in a public right of
way, it is recommended that owners and/or developers direct such discharges
toward the rear of structures away from the right of way, assuming that said
discharge can be adequately and safely conveyed by either surface flow or by
connection to a private collector drainpipe that is provided specifically for
this purpose and maintained by a homeowners' association. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-

obtaining the appropriate grading and drainage permit as defined below. The
director of engineering will issue grading and drainage permits.
In order to preclude inappropriate phasing of developments to circumvent the
intent of this ordinance, when a proposed development activity will occur on a
lot or parcel of land that has contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned by the
same property owner, then the criteria as defined in this section will be
applied to the total land area compiled from aggregate ownership parcels.
A grading and drainage permit shall not be required for the following
circumstances:
   (A)   Any construction activity below the minimum thresholds for a class 1
grading and drainage permit.
   (B)   The agricultural use of land, including the implementation of
conservation measures included in a farm conservation plan approved by the
natural resources conservation service, and including the construction of
agricultural structures.

program previously approved by the director of engineering for the area in
which the site is situated.
      4.   All relevant federal, state, and local permits.
      5.   Applicant is successful in the appeals process.
   (C)   Failure of the director of engineering to act on an original or
revised application within sixty (60) days of receipt shall authorize the
applicant to proceed in accordance with the plans as filed and in compliance
with the regulations contained herein, unless such time is extended by
agreement between the director of engineering and the applicant. Pending
preparation and approval of a revised plan, development activities may be
allowed to proceed in accordance with conditions established by the director of
engineering. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-18: OTHER AGENCY PERMITS:
   (A)   The director of engineering shall not issue a grading and drainage
permit unless all required federal, state and drainage district permits have
been obtained by the applicant and copies thereof reviewed by the director of
engineering. The acquisition of these permits shall be the sole responsibility
of the applicant. The granting of a grading and drainage permit under these
regulations shall in no way affect the owner's responsibility to obtain the
approval required by any other statute, ordinance or code, or to meet the
requirements of other city of East Moline ordinances and regulations,
including, but not limited to: building permits; section 404 of the clean
waters act; section 106 of the national historic preservation act; section 10
of the rivers and harbors act; or permitting required by the Illinois
department of natural resources, office of water resources in accordance with

pollution control; and the threatened and endangered species act, 16 USC 1531
et seq.
   (B)   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
"dam" as defined herein, per 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (rules for
construction of dams), shall require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to
permit being issued by the city of East Moline. Any development involving work
in waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams as identified
and regulated by the U.S. army corps of engineers, shall require permits or
sign offs from the corps prior to the issuance of a city of East Moline permit.
(Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-19: PERMIT LIMITATIONS:
   (A)   The issuance of a grading and drainage permit shall constitute an
authorization to do only that work which is described or illustrated on the
application for the permit or on the plans and specifications approved by the
director of engineering.
   (B)   The issuance of a permit or the approval of drawings and
specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, nor an approval of,
any violation of or deviation from the provision of these regulations or any
other ordinance, law, rule, or regulation.
   (C)   The issuance of a permit, based upon drawings and specifications,
shall not prevent the director of engineering from thereafter requiring the
correction of errors in said drawings and specifications or from stopping
unlawful construction operations being carried on thereunder.
   (D)   The grading and drainage permit shall be valid until the completion
date noted in the permit. The director of engineering may grant an extension if
relevant design and construction standards have not changed and if in the
director of engineering's opinion, the work approved under the permit does not
unduly adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the public.
Otherwise, a new permit shall be acquired before work is started or continued.
The director of engineering may require modification of the SWPPP to prevent
any increase in erosion or off site sediment runoff resulting from any
extension. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-20: REVOCATION OF PERMITS:
   (A)   The director of engineering may revoke a permit:
      1.   Where there has been any false or inaccurate statement or
misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application or plans on which
the permit was based.
      2.   When work is performed contrary to the provisions of the application
or plans on which the permit is based.
   (B)   When a permit is revoked, the director of engineering shall inform the
permittee, in writing, of the specific steps the permittee must take in order
to have the permit reissued.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to continue any work authorized by a permit after
revocation of that permit until that permit is reissued or until a new permit
is issued.
   (D)   In cases where the permittee wishes to appeal the decision of the
director of engineering, the appeal process outlined in section
8-12-13 of this chapter will be followed. An appeal shall stay all proceedings
in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the director of engineering
certifies to the storm water board of appeals, after the notice of the appeal
has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a
stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. (Ord. 07-
18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-21: LIABILITY:
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter is intended to relieve the applicant for a
drainage permit of responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise
imposed by law nor shall liability for any such damage be placed in any manner
upon the city.
   (B)   The city of East Moline, its employees, officers, or agents, will not
be made liable for any damage by: 1) the issuance of a drainage permit under
this chapter, 2) compliance with the provisions of that drainage permit or
conditions attached to it by the director of engineering, 3) failure of the
city of East Moline to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions,
4) failure of the city of East Moline officials to recommend denial or to deny
a drainage permit, or 5) exemptions from drainage permit requirements of this
chapter.
   (C)   The city of East Moline will maintain those drainage facilities that
are on public land, public rights of way, and easements, and have been
dedicated and accepted for maintenance or stipulated by agreement for
maintenance by the city of East Moline. All other drainage facilities, when
located on other than public property, shall be the responsibility of the owner
of the property on which they exist or the owner of the drainage facility,
regardless of whether or not dedicated easements exist over said facilities and
the city shall have no responsibility or liability therefor.
The responsible party shall at all times properly operate and maintain all
facilities and systems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances)
which are installed to achieve compliance with conditions of this permit.
Proper operation and maintenance includes effective performance, adequate
funding, adequate operator staffing and training, and appropriate quality
assurance procedures. Abandonment and alteration, either structural or
operational, of all facilities and systems shall occur only following
application and issuance of a permit. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-22: RETENTION OF PLANS:
Plans, specifications, and reports for all site developments shall be retained
by the director of engineering as required by Illinois statute. (Ord. 07-18,
10-15-2007)
8-12-23: POSTCONSTRUCTION RUNOFF CONTROL:
Use of BMPs identified by this ordinance, or the use of any other BMPs not
herein discussed, are strongly encouraged by this ordinance. This list of
definitions is not exclusive and developers are encouraged to utilize whatever
BMPs may be appropriate for a specific site.
   (A)   Preserving Regulatory Floodplains, Flood Prone And Wetland Areas:
      1.   Buffer zones: An area along a shoreline, wetland, or stream where
development is restricted or prohibited. The primary function of aquatic
buffers is to physically protect and separate a stream, lake, or wetland from
future disturbance or encroachment. The three (3) types of buffers are water
pollution hazard setbacks, vegetated buffers, and engineered buffers.
      2.   Conservation easements: Voluntary agreements that allow an
individual or group to set aside private property to limit the type or amount
of development on their property. The conservation easement can cover all or a
portion of a property and can either be permanent or last for a specified time.
The easement is typically described in terms of the resource it is designed to
protect (e.g., agricultural, forest, historic, or open space easements) and
explains and mandates the restrictions on the uses of the particular property.
   (B)   Minimizing Impervious Surfaces On The Property:
      1.   Open Space Design, Conservation Development: A better site design
technique that concentrates dwelling units in a compact area in one portion of
the development site in exchange for providing open space and natural areas
elsewhere on the site. The minimum lot sizes, setbacks and frontage distances
for the residential zone are relaxed in order to create the open space.
      2.   Narrower Streets: In many residential settings, streets can be as
narrow as twenty two (22) to twenty six feet (26') wide without sacrificing
emergency access, on street parking or vehicular and pedestrian safety. Even
narrower access streets or shared driveways can be used when only a handful of
homes need to be served. Use of narrower streets will only be allowed on public
streets by requesting a variance from the city of East Moline subdivision
ordinance.
      3.   Eliminating Curbs And Gutters: Elimination of curbs and gutters
involves the use of grass swales and ditches as an alternative to curbs and
gutters along residential streets. Eliminating curbs and gutters from public
streets will only be allowed by requesting a variance from the city of East
Moline subdivision ordinance.
      4.   Alternative Turnarounds: Alternative turnarounds are designs for end
of street vehicle turnaround that replace cul-de-sacs and reduce the amount of
impervious cover created in residential neighborhoods. Numerous alternatives
create less impervious cover than the traditional forty foot (40') cul-de-sac.
These alternatives include reducing cul-de-sacs to a thirty foot (30') radius
and creating hammerheads, loop roads, and pervious islands in the cul-de-sac
center by requesting a variance from the city of East Moline subdivision
ordinance.
      5.   Alternative Pavers: Alternative pavers are permeable surfaces that
can replace asphalt and concrete and can be used for driveways, parking lots,
and walkways. Commercially available pavers are used which contain void spaces
for grass or clean, washed stone or gravel. Gravel, cobble, or mulch parking
lots are prohibited.
   (C)   Storm Water Wetlands, Gassed Swales And Vegetated Filter Strips:
      1.   Storm Water Wetlands: Storm water wetlands (a.k.a. constructed
wetlands) are structural practices similar to wet ponds that incorporate
wetland plants into the design. Storm water wetlands are designed specifically
for the purpose of treating storm water runoff. A distinction should be made
between using a constructed wetland for storm water management and diverting
storm water into a natural wetland. The latter practice is not recommended
because altering the hydrology of the existing wetland with additional storm
water can degrade the resource and result in plant die off and the destruction
of wildlife habitat.
      2.   Grassed Swales: The term swale (a.k.a. grassed channel, dry swale,
wet swale, biofilter) refers to a series of vegetated, open channel management
practices designed specifically to treat and attenuate storm water runoff for a
specified water quality volume. As storm water runoff flows through these
channels, it is treated through filtering by the vegetation in the channel,
filtering through a subsoil matrix, and/or infiltration into the underlying
soils.
      3.   Vegetated Filter Strips: Vegetated surfaces that are designed to
treat sheet flow from adjacent surfaces. Filter strips function by slowing
runoff velocities and filtering out sediment and other pollutants.
   (D)   Infiltrating Runoff On Site:
      1.   Sand And Organic Filters: Sand filters are usually two (2) chambered
storm water practices; the first is a settling chamber, and the second is a
filter bed filled with sand or another filtering media. As storm water flows
into the first chamber, large particles settle out, and then finer particles
and other pollutants are removed as storm water flows through the filtering
medium. There are several modifications of the basic sand filter design,
including the surface sand filter, underground sand filter, perimeter sand
filter, organic media filter, and multichamber treatment train.
      2.   Infiltration Trenches: An infiltration trench is a rock filled
trench with no outlet that receives storm water runoff. Storm water runoff
passes through some combination of pretreatment measures, such as a swale and
detention basin, and into the trench. There, runoff is stored in the void space
between the stones and infiltrates through the bottom and into the soil matrix.
      3.   Infiltration Basins: Infiltration basin is a shallow impoundment
which is designed to infiltrate storm water into the ground water. Infiltration
basins should only be used on small drainage areas (less than 10 acres), and
where soils are highly permeable.
      4.   Porous Pavements: Porous pavement is a permeable pavement surface
with an underlying stone reservoir to temporarily store surface runoff before
it infiltrates into the subsoil. This porous surface replaces traditional
pavement, allowing parking lot storm water to infiltrate directly and receive
water quality treatment. There are a few porous pavement options, including
porous asphalt, pervious concrete, and grass pavers.
      5.   Bioretention: Bioretention areas are landscaping features adapted to
provide on site treatment of storm water runoff. They are commonly located in
parking lot islands or within small pockets of residential land uses. Surface
runoff is directed into shallow, landscaped depressions. These depressions are
designed to incorporate many of the pollutant removal mechanisms that operate
in forested ecosystems. During storms, runoff ponds above the mulch and soil in
the system. Runoff from larger storms is generally diverted past the facility
to the storm drain system. The remaining runoff filters through the mulch and
prepared soil mix. Typically, the filtered runoff is collected in a perforated
underdrain and returned to the storm drain system.
   (E)   Providing Storm Water Retention Structures:
      1.   On Lot Treatment: On lot treatment is a series of practices that are
designed to collect runoff from individual residential or small commercial
lots. The primary purpose of most on lot practices is to manage rooftop runoff
and, to a lesser extent, driveway and sidewalk runoff. Although there are a
wide variety of on lot treatment options, they can all be classified into one
of three (3) categories: a) practices that collect and infiltrate rooftop
runoff; b) practices that divert runoff or soil moisture to a pervious area;
and c) practices that store runoff for later use.
      2.   Retention Basins: Retention basins are designed to collect and hold
storm water runoff, with no outlet pipes or structures. They are not
necessarily infiltration basins, and are best designed to rely mostly on
evaporation. Retention basins are only feasible when special circumstances of
land and soil type are available.
   (F)   Providing Wet Or Wetland Detention Structures: Wet detention
structures are defined and controlled under section
8-12-25, "Detention System Design Criteria", of this chapter.
   (G)   Providing Dry Detention Structures: Dry detention structures are
defined and controlled under section
8-12-25, "Detention System Design Criteria", of this chapter. Detention basins
shall be designed to remove floatables from storm water runoff by providing
trash grates or special outlet structures which separate floatables.
   (H)   Constructing Storm Sewers:
      1.   Manufactured Products For Storm Water Inlets: A variety of products
for storm water inlets are known as swirl separators, or hydrodynamic
structures. Swirl separators are modifications of the traditional oil grit
separator and include an internal component that creates a swirling motion as
storm water flows through a cylindrical chamber. The concept behind these
designs is that sediments settle out as storm water moves in this swirling
path. Additional compartments or chambers are sometimes present to trap oil and
other floatables. There are several different types of proprietary separators,
each of which incorporates slightly different design variations, such as off
line application.
      2.   Catch Basin Inserts: Catch basin efficiency can be improved using
commercially available inserts, which can be designed to remove oil and grease,
trash, debris, and sediment. Some inserts are designed to drop directly into
existing catch basins, while others may require being installed as part of the
construction of the basin.
      3.   In Line Storage Structures: In line storage refers to a number of
practices designed to use the storage within the storm drain system to detain
flows. Storage is achieved by placing devices in the storm drain system to
restrict the rate of flow. Devices can slow the rate of flow by backing up
flow, as in the case of a dam or weir, or through the use of vortex valves,
devices that reduce flow rates by creating a helical flow path in the
structure.
   (I)   Water Quality And Multiple Uses: The drainage system should be
designed to minimize adverse surface and ground water quality impacts off site
and on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features
to capture storm water runoff pollutants. All flows from the development shall
be routed through the basin (i.e., low flows shall not be bypassed). Detention
of storm water shall be promoted throughout the property's drainage system to
reduce the volume of storm water runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff
pollutants. The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, fishing, trails,
playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-
2007)
8-12-24: HYDROLOGIC DESIGN CRITERIA FOR CLASS 2 PROJECTS:
   (A)   Referenced Standards: Design standards for hydrologic design shall
comply with these regulations and with the applicable provisions of the IDOT
drainage and design manuals. Where the IDOT drainage and design manuals do not
detail requirements, the "Illinois Urban Manual", latest edition, shall be
used. Where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions than those imposed by
the IDOT drainage and design manuals or those required by other provisions of
law or ordinance, the provisions of this ordinance shall prevail.
   (B)   Release Rates: The drainage system for new developments or
redevelopments shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the
total property under development so that in the event of a 100-year rainfall
event in the postdeveloped condition, the release rate is less than or equal to
the discharge from a 5-year rainfall event in the predeveloped condition. Under
no circumstances, with any rainfall event, shall the postdevelopment discharge
exceed the predevelopment discharge. Where a detailed hydrologic or hydraulic
model exists, release rates shall be established and incorporated as part of
this ordinance.
   (C)   Drainage System Design And Evaluation: The following criteria should
be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The design will
provide capacity to pass the 10-year, twenty four (24) hour peak flow in the
minor drainage system and an overload flow path (major drainage system) for
flows in excess of the design capacity. Whenever practicable, the storm water
systems shall not result in the interbasin transfer of drainage unless no other
alternative exists.
The design rainfall recurrence interval shall be set by the design application
as follows:
 
Detention                     100 year
Emergency overflow routing    100 year
Bridges                       100 year
Roadway underpasses           50 year
Swales, ditches, and culverts 25 year
Storm sewers                  10 year
 
   (D)   Design Methodologies: An applicable hydrologic design method may be
selected from the "IDOT Drainage Manual" with the following modifications and
clarifications. Minor conveyance systems for areas up to one hundred (100)
acres, and major conveyance systems up to ten (10) acres may be designed using
the rational method. Design runoff rates may be calculated using a continuous
simulation model or by event hydrographic methods. If event hydrographic
methods are used they must be HEC-HMS, HEC-1, SCS TR20, or SCS TR55. Event
methods must incorporate the following assumptions:
      1.   Antecedent moisture condition 2 (normal moisture).
      2.   Huff or SCS type 2 distribution.
For design events the Illinois state water survey bulletin 70 (northwest)
rainfall data must be used. Storage volumes for detention must be twenty four
(24) hour events. Storm water conveyance capacities must be designed for the
critical duration creating the highest peak. The following table lists data
from bulletin 70:

   (E)   Positive Drainage: All developments must be provided an overland flow
path that will pass the 100-year, twenty four (24) hour flow within designated
drainage easements or the public right of way with a freeboard of at least one
foot (1'). Overland flow paths shall be provided drainage easements unless the
flow is contained in the public right of way.
   (F)   Culvert, Road And Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tail water conditions on the
culvert.
   (G)   Vegetated Filter Strips And Swales: To effectively filter storm water
pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites should be designed to
maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales, shall be designed to
follow criteria in the "Illinois Urban Manual". Whenever practicable, runoff
from impervious surfaces should be directed onto filter strips and swales
comprised of native grasses and forbs before being routed to a storm sewer or
detention basin.
   (H)   Maintenance Considerations: The storm water drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Use of native vegetation is
strongly encouraged to reduce maintenance, increase wildlife habitat, and to
provide other benefits. Where nonnative vegetation is used, turfed side slopes
shall be designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet
basins shall be provided with alternate outflows, which can be used to
completely drain the pool for sediment removal. Pumping may be considered if
drainage by gravity is not feasible. Presedimentation basins shall be included,
where feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Site access for
heavy equipment shall be provided. A maintenance plan for the ongoing
maintenance of all storm water management system components including wetlands
is required prior to plan approval. The plan shall include:
      1.   Maintenance tasks.
      2.   The party responsible for performing the maintenance tasks.
      3.   A description of all permanent public or private access maintenance
easements and overland flow paths, and compensatory storage areas.
      4.   A description of dedicated sources of funding for the required
maintenance.
   (I)   Provisions For Agricultural Drainage:
      1.   Existing easements for any agricultural drainage systems located
underneath areas that will be developed shall be preserved. If no such easement
exists, an easement shall be dedicated for access and maintenance as provided
for in this ordinance.
      2.   All agricultural drainage systems that serve upstream areas outside
of the development and that are located underneath areas that will be developed
shall be replaced with nonperforated conduit to prevent root blockage,
provided, however, that the existing drainage district system may remain in
place with the approval of the appropriate entity.
      3.   Agricultural drainage systems that, due to development, will be
located underneath streets, driveways, and other paved areas as allowed by this
ordinance, shall be replaced with conduits meeting the city of East Moline's
standards as needed to prevent the collapse of the agricultural drainage
conduit.
      4.   Agricultural drainage systems may be relocated within the
development area upon the approval of the director of engineering. Such
relocation shall maintain sufficient slope and capacity to prevent
sedimentation and to prevent an increase in scouring or structural damage to
the conduit. Such relocation shall only be with the consent and approval of the
appropriate entity responsible for the system. If the system is not under the
authority of a drainage district, the director of engineering shall consider
the interests of those landowners who are served by the system.
   (J)   Channel Modifications: Channel modification is acceptable if the
purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality. If the
proposed development activity involves a channel modification, it must be
demonstrated that:
      1.   Water quality and other natural functions would be significantly
improved by the modification or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an
equivalent degree of natural resource values.
      2.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed
in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of
the stream or body of water affected. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)

on a lot in a new subdivision for which detention is otherwise provided.
         (b)   The development is on a lot or parcel in a subdivision for which
detention was provided and approved prior to the effective date of these
regulations.
      2.   The requirement for storm water detention and release rate shall be
waived by the director of engineering when he/she determines it is in the best
interest of the city of East Moline to require a fee in lieu of detention as
described in subsection (O) of this section.
   (D)   Ownership: Detention basins are owned by the property owner (often a
homeowners' association) unless otherwise described by this ordinance or
indicated by the director of engineering. Property developers shall contact the
director of engineering to inquire about the ownership and maintenance
responsibility of existing regional detention basins which may affect the
development.
   (E)   Maintenance And Repair Responsibilities:
      1.   Detention ponds and associated inflow and outflow systems are
maintained by the property owner absent any specific legal agreement to the
contrary.
      2.   Maintenance agreements may be required at the option of the director
of engineering to define parties responsible for the maintenance of commercial
detention basins.
      3.   The detention basin owner shall be responsible for the following
items:
         (a)   An annual report on the detention basin condition, using the
checklist attached to the ordinance codified herein, shall be submitted to the
director of engineering.
         (b)   At five (5) year intervals, the basin shall be inspected by a
professional engineer registered in the state of Illinois. A report of this
inspection shall be submitted to the director of engineering within sixty (60)
days of the inspection. The inspection shall include an evaluation of the
checklist items in the checklist attached to the ordinance codified herein. An
annual report is not required the year the five (5) year report is due.
         (c)   Detention basin owners shall notify subsequent owners of their
maintenance responsibilities and transfer basin maintenance records to the
party with active maintenance responsibility.
         (d)   These requirements shall be effective for all detention basins
existing in the city of East Moline on the adoption date hereof as well as
detention basins constructed after the effective date.
   (F)   General Basin Design Requirements:
      1.   Erosion Control: Temporary and permanent erosion control shall be
required for all detention basins in accordance with this ordinance.
      2.   Verification And Final Approval:
         (a)   Erosion protection shall be inspected throughout the project
duration.
         (b)   Detention basin storage volume shall be verified to the
satisfaction of the director of engineering through as built surveys or other
means.

inspected for completeness of cover.
         (e)   The basin will receive final approval upon fulfillment of
subsections (F)2(b), (F)2(c), and (F)2(d) of this section, and the anniversary
date of maintenance and repair reporting will be recorded as such.
         (f)   All basins must receive final approval within ninety (90) days
of the substantial completion as determined by the director of engineering of
any of the following:
            (1)   The first phase (as shown on approved plans) of construction
of public utilities and roadways in any approved subdivision project. Detention
structures for the ultimate development area must be constructed during the
first phase of the project, and approved at its completion. The detention
structures must then be maintained and repaired in conformance with this
ordinance, during future construction phases.
            (2)   Parking areas, floor slabs and/or other impervious areas (as
shown on approved plans, and not including sidewalks) for work on an individual
lot requiring an individual permit under this ordinance. Phased construction
will be treated as in the above case.
            (3)   Mass earthwork or rough grading, if no other phased
construction is scheduled to be started within one hundred eighty (180) days.
         (g)   Failure to receive final approval as required will be considered
a violation of this ordinance.
      3.   Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes,
infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement shall
follow criteria in the "Illinois Urban Manual" and other relevant permitting.
An appropriate sediment control device shall be provided to remove coarse
sediment from storm water flows before they reach infiltration basins or
trenches. Storm water shall not be allowed to stand more than seventy two (72)
hours over eighty percent (80%) of the dry basin's bottom area for the maximum
design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom of infiltration basins or trenches
shall be a minimum of three feet (3') above the seasonally high ground water
and bedrock level if practicable. Engineering calculations demonstrating
infiltration rates shall be included with the application.
      4.   Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at their design
(full) capacity should be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls
into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. It is desirable for
the side slopes of detention basins and open channels to not be steeper than
three to one (3:1) (horizontal to vertical); certain types of basins have
different requirements as defined by this ordinance. Detention basin side
slopes above normal pool shall be designed with permanent erosion protection
consisting of grass, nongrass vegetation, or other permanent finish. At least
six inches (6") of topsoil must be provided on side slopes above normal pool
elevation whenever nonstructural, permanent erosion control is not being used.
Permanent erosion protection shall be aesthetically suitable to the development
or existing surrounding land use.
      5.   Overflow Structures: All storm water detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity
of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to the 100-year rainfall event inflow rate. Weirs, dams and
specialized outflows shall be designed by a professional engineer registered in
the state of Illinois.
      6.   Detention Basin Outlet Design:
         (a)   Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage
system shall be addressed when designing the outlet.
         (b)   Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to
control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of twelve inches (12"). If
design release rates call for smaller outlets, a design that minimizes the
possibility of clogging shall be used.
      7.   Other Design Requirements:
         (a)   "Bubble up" outlets are prohibited.
         (b)   Pumped outlets and other active control structures are
discouraged and must be preapproved on a case by case basis by the director of
engineering.
         (c)   Temporary erosion techniques shall be used as required to ensure
a full stand of cover vegetation in minimum time.
      8.   Location Requirements:
         (a)   In subdivisions, detention basins and their 100-year design high
water shall be contained within platted lots dedicated for drainage purposes.
In redevelopments, detention basins and their 100-year design high water shall
be contained within a drainage easement.
         (b)   Detention basin lots shall have a minimum of twenty feet (20')
of frontage on a right of way for the purpose of providing unrestricted access
for maintenance. Exceptions may be made for infill development.
         (c)   A twenty foot (20') minimum setback shall be required from all
property lines to the normal pool elevation which is considered to be the
elevation of the water level at the permanent depth of the wet basin pool
rather than the temporary depth during drainage events.
         (d)   Detention basins shall be provided with a minimum of one foot
(1') of freeboard above the 100-year design water elevation.
         (e)   There shall be at least two feet (2') of freeboard between the
100-year design water elevation and all boundaries of the parcel or easement
containing the basin.
      9.   Accommodating Flows From Upstream Tributary Areas: Storm water
runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design
of the property's drainage system. Flows from upstream areas that are not to be
detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site being
developed.
      10.   Upstream Areas Not Meeting Ordinance Requirements: When there are
areas not meeting the storage and release rates of this ordinance, tributary to
the applicant's property, the following steps shall be followed:
         (a)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property using the release rates and procedures described in this ordinance.
         (b)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance, shall be identified.
         (c)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property
area, total storage and release rates needed for the combined properties shall
be computed using the release rates and procedures described in this ordinance.
If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover,
based on local zoning, shall be used for the purposes of computing storage.
         (d)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the city of
East Moline may choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to
accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited
to the storage for his property as computed above. If regional storage is
selected by the city of East Moline, the director of engineering will work with
the applicant to implement the requirements of this ordinance. If regional
storage is rejected by the city of East Moline, the applicant shall bypass all
tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever practicable as
determined by the director of engineering. If the applicant must route upstream
flows through his basin and the upstream areas exceed one square mile in size,
the applicant must meet the provisions of on stream detention in this
ordinance.
      11.   Upstream Areas Meeting Ordinance Requirements: When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this ordinance,
tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed
around the applicant's detention basin if this is the only practicable
alternative as determined by the director of engineering. Storage needed for
the applicant's property shall be computed as described in this ordinance.
However, if the city of East Moline decides to route tributary area flows
through an applicant's basin, the final design storm water releases shall be
based on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas.
It must be shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's
property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property alone.
      12.   Early Completion Of Detention Facilities: Where detention or
retention are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property, they
shall be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program. Any
eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the applicant
on a regular basis and before project completion in order to maintain the
design volume of the facilities.
   (G)   Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as
much as feasible to be available for recreational use.
      1.   Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep, excluding
near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they
shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of the
bottom area to prevent winter kill.
      2.   Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool
elevation shall not be steeper than five to one (5:1) horizontal to vertical.
It is recommended that native aquatic vegetation be established around the
perimeter to provide protection from shoreline erosion. Slopes below a depth of
eight feet (8') are permitted to be two to one (2:1), in accordance with IDOT
standard specifications section 204.
      3.   Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-
year, twenty four (24) hour event as a minimum.
      4.   Inlet And Outlet Orientation: The distance between detention inlets
and outlets shall be maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of
the basin providing that the orientation does not create undue hardship based
on topography or other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use
baffles or berms in the basin bottom to prevent short circuiting. There shall
be no low flow bypass between the inlet and outlet. The minimum flow length
shall be ten feet (10') with a recommended minimum ratio of two to one (2:1)
for width.
      5.   Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least four feet (4') in width, two and one-half (21/2) to three feet
(3') below the normal water depth.
      6.   Aeration: Wet bottom basins shall have a natural or artificial means
of aeration.
      7.   Dewatering: An outlet structure shall be provided to allow
dewatering of the pond for maintenance. Gravity dewatering is strongly
preferred.
      8.   Soil Permeability: Wet bottom basin design shall include an
evaluation of soil permeability. A basin liner shall be included in the design
if needed to ensure water retention to normal pool elevation.
      9.   Detention/Sedimentation: It is encouraged that consideration of
routing runoff from the development through a stilling basin be considered.
   (H)   Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other requirements of
this ordinance, dry basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants,
to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be
available for multiple uses.
      1.   Dry Basin Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty
percent (80%) of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than
seventy two (72) hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year, twenty four
(24) hour event. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the wet portion of the
basin bottom. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to accomplish this
requirement.
      2.   Minimum Bottom Slope: Dry bottom basins shall have two percent (2%)
minimum bottom slopes or underdrain systems as approved by the director of
engineering.
      3.   Low Flow Channel: Dry bottom basins may include a low flow channel
with some form of erosion protection.
      4.   Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize resuspension of pollutants.
      5.   Dry Basin Inlet And Outlet Orientation: Dry basin inlet and outlet
orientation shall be the same as for wet basins.
      6.   Temporary Sediment Trap: A sediment trap shall be constructed at
each major inlet to a dry basin during construction. The temporary sediment
trap should be designed in accordance with criteria in the "Illinois Urban
Manual".
   (I)   Detention On Prime Farmland: The placement of detention basins shall
avoid the utilization of prime farmland. All detention basin construction shall
examine potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address
measures that will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with
other relevant permitting.
   (J)   Detention In Floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the
floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the storm water detention requirements
of this ordinance may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site, provided the following provisions are met as
well as all required state, federal and local permits.
      1.   Detention In Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the
volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin,
including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall
still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The
applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all stream flow and floodplain
backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses
shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain
storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below
the existing 10-year elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing
10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the existing 10-year flood
elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain
freely and openly to the watercourse.
      2.   Detention In Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with subsection (J)3 of this section.
      3.   On Stream Detention: On stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this ordinance with respect to water quality and control of the
5-year and 100-year, twenty four (24) hour events from the property. The volume
of detention shall be provided in addition to the existing stream floodway
storage. Further criteria are presented in subsection (K) of this section. If
on stream detention is used in watersheds larger than one square mile, the
applicant will use hydrographic modeling to demonstrate that the design will
not increase the water level for any properties upstream or downstream of the
property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on stream detention:
         (a)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning;
         (b)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water
quality or stream aquatic habitat;
         (c)   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a presedimentation basin;
         (d)   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands;
         (e)   Shall require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program throughout the upstream watershed which shall include as a
minimum: runoff reduction "best management practices" (BMPs) consistent with
section
8-12-23 of this chapter;
         (f)   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge;
         (g)   Shall not contribute to the duration or flood frequency of any
adjacent land.
   (K)   Drainage Into Wetlands, Rivers, Streams, Lakes, Ponds, And Areas:
Wetlands, rivers, streams, lakes and ponds shall be protected from damaging
modifications and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated
with land developments. In addition to the other requirements of this
ordinance, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose
drainage flows into wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds:
      1.   Detention In Wetlands, Rivers, Streams, Lakes Or Ponds: Existing
wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds shall not be modified for the purposes of
storm water detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modifications
will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial
functions and shall comply with other relevant permitting. Existing storage and
release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds shall be
maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the
requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage.
      2.   Sediment Control: The existing wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds
shall be protected during construction and as further regulated in this
chapter.
      3.   Alteration Of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be
altered to substantially decrease or increase the existing area tributary to
wetlands, rivers, lakes or ponds. Drainage patterns shall not be altered by
development to direct runoff off site to other than natural drainage outlets
existing prior to development.
      4.   Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be
routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture
the 2-year, twenty four (24) hour event and hold it for at least twenty four
(24) hours, before being discharged to the basin. This basin shall be
constructed before property grading begins and shall be maintained throughout
the construction process. In addition, the BMP hierarchy defined in section
8-12-23 of this chapter, should be followed to minimize runoff volumes and
rates being discharged.
      5.   Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet
(25') in width, preferably vegetated with native plant species, shall be
maintained or restored around the periphery of a wetland, river, stream, lake
or pond.
   (L)   Street Detention: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or
major drainage system, ponding depths shall follow the criteria below:
      1.   Principal And Minor Arterials:
         (a)   Flow from a 10-year storm shall not inundate the center twenty
feet (20') of the pavement.
         (b)   Flow from a 50-year storm shall be carried without damage to any
building.
      2.   Collector Streets:
         (a)   Flow from a 10-year storm shall not inundate the center ten feet
(10') of the pavement.
         (b)   Flow from a 50-year storm shall be carried without damage to any
building.
      3.   Local Streets:
         (a)   Flow from a 10-year storm shall not top the curb.
         (b)   Flow from a 50-year storm shall be carried without damage to any
building.
   (M)   Parking Lot Detention: The maximum storm water ponding depth in any
parking area shall not exceed six inches (6").
   (N)   Rooftop Detention: Rooftop storage of excess storm water shall be
designed and constructed to meet with the city of East Moline building code.
   (O)   Fee In Lieu Of Detention:
      1.   For the purpose of satisfying the requirements for storm water
detention or compensatory storage for a development or redevelopment on a
property for which detention or compensatory storage was not previously
provided, a fee in lieu of detention or compensatory storage may be assessed
against the development prior to the issuance of a permit. Fees shall be
calculated to establish the property's fair share of costs to provide detention
or compensatory storage for the watershed or drainage basin in which the
property exists. The cost figures used for detention shall be actual costs for
detention or compensatory storage being provided by contract or estimated costs
for planned detention or compensatory storage facilities approved by the
director of engineering. All revenues received through such fees shall be used
for no purpose other than defraying public costs associated with providing
detention or compensatory storage facilities.
      2.   The city of East Moline also may require a fee for each acre/foot of
detention needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin on site, provided
the property will discharge storm water into existing or proposed detention
facilities with added capacity for the additional runoff.
   (P)   Cooperative Detention: The city of East Moline will consider joint
detention facilities developed through cooperative efforts that comply with all
requirements of this ordinance. (Ord. 07-18, 10-15-2007)
8-12-26: STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWPPP):
   (A)   General:
      1.   The area disturbed shall be assumed to include the entire property
area unless the applicable plans specifically exclude certain areas from
disturbance.
      2.   The owner bears the responsibility for implementation of the SWPPP
and notification of all contractors and utility agencies on the site.
      3.   SWPPPs must be provided for all phases of development, including
sanitary sewer construction, storm drainage system construction, water line,
street and sidewalk construction, general grading and the construction of
individual homes. The class 2 grading and drainage permit holder will not be
required to provide an SWPPP for the activities of utility agencies.
      4.   The regulations for construction or postconstruction management will
be used for all regulated construction sites that are contained in the most
recent edition of the "Illinois Urban Manual".
      5.   The city of East Moline will use the Illinois department of
transportation (IDOT) system of compliance that is outlined in the "Bureau Of
Design And Environment (BDE) Design Manual".
      6.   The subsequent owners of individual lots in a subdivision with an
approved SWPPP bears the responsibility for continued implementation of the
approved SWPPPs for all construction activity within or related to the
individual lot, excluding construction managed by utility agencies.
   (B)   Requirements For Utility Construction:

   (F)   General Erosion And Sediment Control Design Features: The following
principles shall apply to all construction undertaken under the authorization
of a class 2 grading and drainage permit:
      1.   New development or redevelopment shall be designed to create the
least potential for erosion. The disturbance of slopes greater than seven
percent (7%) should be avoided wherever possible. Natural contours should be
followed as closely as possible.
      2.   Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and
wetlands are to be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
      3.   Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond
or wetland. Preventative measures shall reflect the sensitivity of these areas
to erosion and sedimentation.
      4.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      5.   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters
from land undergoing development.
      6.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance must be considered.
      7.   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or
downstream.
      8.   Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and
functional as soon as practical during development. Disturbed areas shall be
stabilized with approved permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days
following the end of active disturbance or redisturbance.
      9.   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
      10.   All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall
be properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site
by either wind or water.
      11.   All construction sites shall provide measures to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
      12.   All temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained to function as intended until the contributing drainage area has
been permanently stabilized at which time they shall be removed within thirty
(30) days after final site stabilization.
   (G)   Materials And Construction Notes:
      1.   Silt fence and coconut fiber shall be installed in accordance with
the material and construction requirements of the "Illinois Urban Manual".
      2.   Erosion control blankets, bales, seeding and riprap shall be
installed in accordance with material and construction requirements of the
"Illinois Urban Manual", latest edition.

8-13-3: Property Subject To Stormwater Utility Service Charge
8-13-4: Billing
8-13-5: Appeals Concerning Fees
8-13-6: Collection; Lien
8-13-1: PURPOSE; INTENT:
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to establish a stormwater utility to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of East Moline
from damage caused by stormwater runoff and floods by reduction, control and
prevention of the discharge of pollutants to the city's municipal separate
storm sewer utility system. The stormwater utility shall be responsible for
collecting revenue to directly support maintenance and repair of the existing
storm drain systems, development of drainage plans, flood control measures, and
water quality programs, and funding of capital improvements. The stormwater
utility shall require that all property owners within the city, all of whom
ultimately benefit from the aforementioned, pay an appropriate share of the
cost of the drainage, detention and flood protection facilities necessary to
manage such stormwater and floods.
The stormwater utility shall function as a self-supported "enterprise fund" in
the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from the city's
general fund for purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to
the utility's operation, maintenance, and capital financing costs.
   (B)   Some specific stormwater management services the city of East Moline
is responsible for include:
      1.   Maintaining the city's levees and flood protection infrastructure.
      2.   Developing, administering, inspecting, and enforcing a federally
mandated stormwater program that is required by USEPA's phase II of the
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) program.
      3.   Preventing harmful pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff
into local streams and rivers as required by USEPA.
      4.   Keeping public streets drained and cleared to make travel safe and
minimize flood hazards.
      5.   Performing necessary maintenance, repairs and replacement of aging
stormwater infrastructure including stormwater inlets, pipes, culverts, and
other structures to safely collect and convey stormwater through all parts of
the city.
      6.   Making repairs to ravines, ditches, open stream channel systems, and
other public drainageways to reduce erosion and loss of property.
      7.   Ongoing inspection and maintenance to mitigate existing and future
problems.
   (C)   It is the intent of the city council in enacting this chapter:
      1.   To promote public health, safety, and welfare by permitting the
movement of emergency vehicles during flooding periods and minimizing flood
losses and the inconvenience and damage to property and infrastructure
resulting from uncontrolled and unplanned stormwater runoff in the city;
      2.   To establish a stormwater utility to coordinate, design, construct,
manage, operate, and maintain the city's stormwater conveyance system and flood
protection infrastructure and to fund the same;
      3.   To provide for and promote compliance by the city with federal and
state laws governing the discharge of pollutants from the municipal storm sewer
system and to provide for and promote compliance with a national pollutant
discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit issued to the city for such
discharge;
      4.   To establish reasonable stormwater fees based on the approximate
contribution of stormwater runoff from each parcel to the city's drainage
facilities which will provide a stable funding source to enable the city of
East Moline to construct, operate, maintain, administer and replace the city of
East Moline stormwater conveyance system, flood protection infrastructure and
for compliance with United States environmental protection agency (USEPA)
stormwater NPDES permit requirements;
      5.   To encourage and facilitate urban water resources management
techniques, including, without limitation, detention of stormwater and
floodwater, reduction of the need to construct storm sewers, reduction of
pollution, and enhancement of the environment;
      6.   To maintain and improve the quality of waterways impacted by the
storm drainage system within the city of East Moline;
      7.   To preserve property values by protecting new and existing buildings
and improvements to buildings from damage due to stormwater and/or floodwater;
      8.   To assure that new developments and redevelopments do not increase
flood or drainage hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible
to erosion;
      9.   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order
to moderate flood and storm water impacts, and to protect water quality;
      10.   To prevent the discharge of contaminated stormwater runoff and
illicit discharges from industrial, commercial, residential, and construction
sites into the storm drainage system within the city of East Moline;
      11.   To promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper
discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil,
petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste,
sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system;
      12.   To encourage recycling of used motor oil and safe disposal of other
hazardous consumer products. (Ord. 09-16, 8-17-2009)
8-13-2: IN GENERAL:
   (A)   All property owners and residents in the city benefit from a
stormwater management program. All property owners receive indirect benefits
from a properly maintained and operated stormwater management system for the
entire city which is on public property. Stormwater management activities with
broad benefits include keeping the public streets drained and cleared so random
flooding does not occur and travel is safe, making necessary stormwater
infrastructure upgrades, reducing erosion and other pollutants that enter
streams and rivers, and collecting and conveying stormwater safely through all
parts of the city. Upgrades and maintenance to the city's flood protection
facilities are also important to the city as a whole. The city as a whole is
also ultimately responsible for compliance with federal, state, and local
regulations for water quality improvements. Even in a case where an individual
property does not drain to the city drainage system, the property still
receives direct benefits, which include protecting the property from upstream
runoff, providing safe streets to travel on during rainfall and flooding,
regional water quality improvements, and other tangible and intangible
benefits.
   (B)   East Moline's public stormwater drainage system conveys rain and
snowmelt runoff from developed properties. Impervious areas on developed
properties increase the amount of runoff, which in turn increases the necessary
size of pipes, structures and ditches. The major contributing factor in water
pollution and erosion is the amount of runoff. Impervious area can be
quantified and is a reasonably objective measure of the amount of stormwater
that leaves a property as runoff.
   (C)   All owners of developed property located within the city of East
Moline shall be charged for and shall pay the city of East Moline, based on the
relative amount of stormwater which is determined to be generated by impervious
developed areas on the owner's real property. The impact of the stormwater
runoff from the aforementioned real property upon the city's stormwater and
flood protection facilities shall be determined on the basis of the rates and
measurements contained and set forth in this section.
   (D)   A stormwater rate study dated April 2009, was prepared by Stanley
Consultants, Inc. (Muscatine, Iowa), and was accepted by the city council by
resolution 09-31 on April 20, 2009.
   (E)   The rate structure utilizes a property's impervious surface area for
assessing the stormwater charge. A unit of impervious surface area on an
average single-family, residential property, or "equivalent residential unit
(ERU)", is the unit used for assessing stormwater charges. One ERU shall equal
two thousand two hundred (2,200) square feet of impervious surface area for the
city of East Moline.
      1.   Three Tiered Rate Structure For Residential And Agricultural Uses:
Single-family homeowners and agricultural customers with a developed property
and having a property gross area less than or equal to two (2) acres will be
charged according to a three (3) tiered rate structure based on the property's
gross area. The following table identifies the criteria for the three (3)
tiered rate structure:
 
Parcel Class Gross Parcel Size                                 Number Of ERUs
Small        Under 11,000 sq. ft. (1/4 acre)                   1 ERU/parcel
Medium       11,000 sq. ft. (1/4 acre) to under 21,800 sq. ft. 1.75 ERUs/parcel
             (1/2 acre)
Large        21,800 sq. ft. (1/2 acre) to 87,120 sq. ft. (2    2.5 ERUs/parcel
             acres)
 
      2.   Stormwater Rates:
         (a)   Commencing on September 20, 2009, to be charged on the October
31, 2009, utility bill, and continuing thereafter, the owners of developed
property shall pay to the city of East Moline a monthly stormwater utility
charge computed in the following manner:
 Utility Rates
 FY 10 FY 11 FY 12
                                                 Utility Rates
                                                 FY 10 FY 11 FY 12
For uses other than single-family residential and            
agricultural:
Stormwater unit rate (per ERU per month)1         $2.32 $2.54 $2.61
Residential and agricultural single-family:
Small parcel                                      2.32  2.54  2.61
Medium parcel                                     4.06  4.45  4.57
Large parcel                                      5.80  6.35  6.53
 
Note:
1.   Charge is unit rate times number of ERUs for measured properties. Actual
impervious area measurements shall be maintained by the city's engineering
department for all residential customers with parcels greater than 2 acres and
nonresidential customers to determine their share of the stormwater management
costs.
         (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, in no
event shall any owner specified herein pay less than the rate required for one
ERU per month.
         (c)   City staff is hereby directed to request the city council to
initiate a review of the stormwater utility service charges and to request the
city council to retain, every three (3) years, an independent third party
professional to perform a cost of service rate analysis, and to recommend any
necessary changes to stormwater utility rates which accurately reflect the cost
to serve customers.
         (d)   As part of the building permit process, property owners shall
coordinate with the city's building inspection and engineering staff to ensure
that, as impervious areas change on the owner's property, due to construction
or demolition, the engineering department maintains up to date records of
impervious areas for use by the finance department in determining proper
stormwater utility billing. (Ord. 09-16, 8-17-2009)
8-13-3: PROPERTY SUBJECT TO STORMWATER UTILITY SERVICE CHARGE:
All developed property located within the city of East Moline, whether publicly
or privately owned and whether subject to or exempt from real property
taxation, shall be subject to the stormwater utility service charges fees
established and set forth under this section, with the following exceptions:
   (A)   Street, highway and railroad right of way;
   (B)   Undeveloped property (i.e., no structures, pavement, or other
impervious area on the lot of record). (Ord. 09-16, 8-17-2009)
8-13-4: BILLING:
The stormwater utility charge shall be computed by the director of engineering
and billed by the director of finance. The stormwater utility charge shall be
combined with the monthly billing for other city of East Moline utility
services or, where multiple water users are located in one building, the
director of finance may bill the property owner, who will then be responsible
for payment, but may allocate the charge among his tenants in an equitable
manner. (Ord. 09-16, 8-17-2009)
8-13-5: APPEALS CONCERNING FEES:
Any property owner aggrieved by the property classification or property type
assigned to the owner's property under this section, or aggrieved by the
computation of the stormwater utility charge affecting the owner's property
under this section, may appeal such actions, determination and/or computations
to the city's director of engineering, or to the director of engineering's
designee. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall state the reason and basis
for the appeal. The director of engineering shall consider the appeal and make
a written determination thereon, which such written determination shall be
provided to the property owner taking or filing the appeal. If the property
owner is not satisfied with the written determination of the director of
engineering, the property owner may then request in writing that the property
owner's appeal be heard and decided by the stormwater board of appeals as
previously provided for under the city of East Moline stormwater control
ordinance. If the property owner is not satisfied with the written
determination of the stormwater board of appeals, the property owner may then
request in writing that the property owner's appeal be heard and decided by the
city council. Such written request for city council review shall be filed with
the city clerk within ten (10) days of the property owner's receipt of the
written determination from the stormwater board of appeals. The decision of the
city council shall be final in such appeals. In case of a successful appeal by
the property owner, said property owner shall be entitled to no more than two
(2) years of refunds or recoveries of fees paid prior to the appeal. (Ord. 09-
16, 8-17-2009)
8-13-6: COLLECTION; LIEN:
The stormwater utility shall be billed as one bill with water and sewerage
charges. Stormwater service charges may be liens upon the real estate of the
property owner, whenever the charges become delinquent, only after the bill
therefor is sent to the owner or owners of record of the real estate. (Ord. 15-

   (B)   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize certain neighborhoods, districts, and corridors;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.

8-14-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 10-31, 10-18-2010)
8-14-10: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the city must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the director of engineering, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of
engineering may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The city, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund,
the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 10-31, 10-18-2010)

may be located within the right of way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right of way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right of way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right of way line and any above
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right of way line or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of city highways may
require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement or
additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.

      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway

by one piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right of way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or city approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated
only if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair and 2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right of way.
      6.   Minimum Cover Of Underground Facilities: Cover shall be provided and

support towing of the vehicle, the administrative hearing officer shall direct

nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under
certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent
areas, particularly adjacent and nearby residential and business areas where
nurseries, schools, nursing homes, churches and similar uses are located.

to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or
downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood or discouraging normal development
of undeveloped areas. These special regulations are itemized in this section. A

      2.   From any public or private school or licensed day care center.
      3.   From any church or religious center.
      4.   From any public park or a City designated pedestrian/bike path.
   (B)   Additional Controls: To prevent such uses from having an adverse
effect upon the adjacent areas in an I-2 District, not more than two (2) such
uses shall be established within one thousand feet (1,000') of each other,
within said I-2 District. Uses subject to these controls hereafter referred to
as "adult regulated uses" are as follows:

file an application for a special use permit. In that event, the applicant
shall file an application for such a permit with the zoning official on a form
he shall prescribe. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or
data prescribed by the Plan Commission and shall include a statement in writing
by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use

application and statement referred to above, the Plan Commission shall hold a
public hearing on the proposed special use. The hearing shall be conducted and
a record of such proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner as the Plan
Commission, by rule, prescribes.
   (B)   Notice Of Hearing: The commission shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing. It shall give at least fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30) days'
notice of the time and place of such hearing by insertion in a daily newspaper
published in East Moline and shall also give notice delivered personally or by
mail at least five (5) days before the time fixed for such hearing to the
applicant or appellant and to the zoning official, and to the respective owners
of record of property adjoining or adjacent to the premises in question, and to
any property owners whose property is situated within two hundred fifty feet
(250') of the subject site, and to any other persons or entities required by
law to be notified and to all persons or entities entitled to object to such
special uses. Any party may appear at such hearing in person or by agent or by
attorney. The commission shall decide the application or appeal within a
reasonable time.
   (C)   Standards: No special use shall be recommended for approval by the
Plan Commission unless such commission shall find:
      1.   That the granting of a special use will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare;
      2.   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already permitted,
not substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
      3.   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
      4.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided;
      5.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
      6.   Restrictions for the use should be consistent with the district in
which the use would normally be located except as may be modified by the Plan
Commission; and
      7.   That the special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the Plan Commission.
   (D)   Conditions And Safeguards: Prior to the granting of any special use,
the Plan Commission shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special
use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the standards specified in the subsection above. In all cases
in which special uses are granted, the Plan Commission shall require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith are being complied with.
   (E)   General Regulation: The Plan Commission shall not authorize a special
use permit unless the Plan Commission specifically finds that the condition or
situation of the special piece of property for which the special use is sought
is not of so typical or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable
the formulation of a general regulation, under an amendment to this title, for
such conditions or stipulations.
   (F)   Time Frame Of Permit: Said special use permit, when granted, shall be
in full force and effect only as long as the applicant of the property affected
retains ownership of said property.
   (G)   Effect Of A Denial Of A Special Use: No application for a special use
that has been denied wholly or in part by the Plan Commission shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial,
except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of conditions found to
be valid by the City Planner.
   (H)   Period During Which The Special Use Shall Commence: The permit for the
construction or operation of the special use shall be issued within one year
after the special use is granted by the Plan Commission. The property owner
shall then complete construction or otherwise commence operation of the special
use within a reasonable time thereafter. If the special use has not been
established within said period, the property owner may submit a request for
extension of the special use to the Plan Commission, which the Plan Commission
may grant upon reasonable terms. If the property owner fails to commence
operation of the special use in the manner set forth above, or obtain an
extension of the special use from the Plan Commission, the special use shall be
null and void.
      1.   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if the
special use applicant makes a specific request in the original application for
special use to have the "one year startup provision" set forth above modified
or waived, then the Plan Commission shall have the power when making its final
decision on the special use to lengthen, shorten, or waive the "one year
startup requirement" for the requested special use.
   (I)   Action By The City Council: If a special use permit requires City
Council approval, as is the case in certain industrial uses that involve Board
of Appeal approval, then the City Council shall not act upon a proposed special
use until the Council has received a written report and recommendation from the
Plan Commission on the proposed special use.
      1.   The concurring vote of five (5) members of the Plan Commission
consisting of nine (9) members is necessary to recommend to the City Council to
approve the petition.
      2.   The City Council may by adoption of an ordinance grant or deny an
application for a special use. The proposed special use ordinance shall not be
approved by the Corporate Authorities, except by a favorable majority vote of
all Alderman of the City Council then holding office. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)

10-24-7: ESTABLISHMENT OF OFF-STREET PARKING:
   (A)   The City Plan Commission, in consultation with other City departments

in the City for the purpose of determining the areas within which there is need
for the establishment of off-street parking facilities to be provided by the
City and to be financed wholly, or in part, by a special assessment district or
by other means. Where such need is found, the Plan Commission shall report its
recommendation for the acquisition of such off-street parking facilities to the
City Council. This report shall include recommendations on the type, size,
location and other pertinent features of the proposed off- street parking
facilities and the areas they are intended to serve.

recommendation of the Plan Commission and after public hearing, may require by
resolution, that a portion, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the off-street
parking facilities required by this chapter shall be provided in connection
with occupancy or use of a building in an area that was included in a special
assessment district for the provision of off-street parking facilities, or in
any other district which the City Council may have determined to be served by a
public off-street parking facility in the following cases:
      1.   In such cases where the use of a building, erected after the levying
of the special assessment in such an area or after the establishment of the
public off-street parking facility, creates a need for an annual or exceptional
amount of off-street parking facilities.
      2.   In such cases where alteration, extension or change in a use of a
building, after the levying of the special assessment in such an area or
establishment of the public off-street parking facility, creates a need for
off-street parking facilities more than thirty percent (30%) in excess of the
requirements of off- street parking facilities for such building or use before
alterations, extensions or changes in use, as computed on the basis of the
requirements in this section.
      3.   In any district, spaces for off-street parking and for loading or
unloading shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of title 8,
chapter 14, "Standards For Construction Of Facilities On Rights-Of-Way", of
this Code. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)

CHAPTER 26
ILLUMINATION STANDARDS
SECTION:
10-26-1: Purpose
10-26-2: Lighting Plan
10-26-3: Illumination Performance Standards
10-26-4: Compliance
10-26-5: Point Of Measurements
10-26-6: PUD Modifications
10-26-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish lighting requirements for personal
safety and crime prevention while regulating any spillover of light and glare
on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses near a light source
to promote personal and traffic safety and to prevent the creation of public
nuisances.
In an effort to encourage the implementation and usage of green and sustainable
infrastructure and equipment, the City of East Moline encourages developers to
utilize, whenever possible, high efficiency lighting such as light emitting
diodes ("LEDs"), compact fluorescent lamps ("CFLs"), etc., in their projects.
(Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)
10-26-2: LIGHTING PLAN:
   (A)   Except for single-family and two-family dwellings, plans for required
parking lot and security lighting shall be approved by the Director of
Engineering prior to approval and issuance of permits. Plans, at appropriate
scale, shall be based on accurate, approved final site plans and shall depict
all exterior lighting as to its location, orientation and configuration. This
must include, but not be limited to:
      1.   Luminaire height;
      2.   Luminaire and standard technical specifications;
      3.   Intensity of illumination shall be measured at the least point of
illumination and the greatest point of illumination when measured from ground
level;
      4.   Type of light source (metal halide, high pressure sodium, etc.);
      5.   Hours of illumination; and
      6.   A photometric plan superimposed on the site plan for each
classification of lighting with points no greater than thirty feet (30') apart.
(Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)
10-26-3: ILLUMINATION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   (A)   The City requires adherence to the following illumination standards:
      1.   Wall Or Roof Lighting: Wall or roof lighting may be used to
illuminate the pedestrian walkways, entrance areas, and yard areas within
thirty feet (30') of the building. No wall or roof lighting shall be used to
illuminate areas for motor vehicle parking or access unless the Director of
Engineering finds the following:
         (a)   That the proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated
purpose in this chapter;
         (b)   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or
restrict public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   That the proposed luminaire has a cutoff angle of less than or
equal to sixty six degrees (66°).
      2.   Freestanding Luminaries: Any open area used for motor vehicle
parking, storage, or access shall be illuminated with freestanding luminaries.
Freestanding luminaries are permitted to be a maximum of thirty feet (30') in
height with a three foot (3') support, for a maximum height from the ground of
thirty three feet (33'). When a luminaire is located within five hundred feet
(500') of a Residential Zoning District, the maximum permitted luminaire height
shall be twenty five feet (25'). All measurements shall be taken from the
average elevation of the finished grade within ten feet (10') of the structure
or fixture to the highest point of the luminaire. All luminaries must have a
total cutoff angle equal to or less than ninety degrees (90°). The use of
exterior lighting with a cutoff angle greater than ninety degrees (90°) shall
be permitted only when the Director of Engineering finds the following:
         (a)   That the lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose in
this chapter;
         (b)   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or
restrict public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   That the proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of
vision creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      3.   Low Pressure Sodium Fixtures: In no instance shall low pressure
sodium fixtures be used to meet the requirements of this chapter unless the
Director of Engineering finds the following:
         (a)   That the proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated
purpose in this section;
         (b)   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or
restrict public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         (c)   That the color distortion effect of low pressure sodium lighting
will not create a hindrance to crime prevention and investigation.
      4.   Intensity Of Lighting: The following shall be adhered to:
         (a)   The amount of illumination attributable to exterior lighting
from a property shall not exceed one foot-candle when measured at any boundary
line with an adjoining property. This provision may be waived by the Director
of Engineering when:
            (1)   The proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated
purpose of this chapter.
            (2)   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance.
            (3)   The proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of
vision creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
         (b)   All parking lot and parking structure lighting located within
three hundred feet (300') of a Residential Zoning District may be illuminated
not more than one hour before the start of business and shall be extinguished
within one hour after the end of business except as approved by the Director of
Engineering after finding the following:
            (1)   The property has been identified as an area where the
incidence or potential for crime warrant additional lighting.
            (2)   Additional lighting is required to increase visibility of a
property which is not readily accessible for police during routine patrol.
            (3)   The use of timers, sensors, or other devices that produce a
reduced lighting level that does not conflict with the stated purpose in this
chapter.
      5.   Glare And Illumination: In all zoning districts, any lighting shall
be arranged to reflect the light away from adjoining property. A person shall
not conduct a use that has a source of illumination that produces glare clearly
visible beyond a property line or creates a sensation of brightness within a
visual field so as to cause annoyance, discomfort, or impairment of vision. The
use of lenses, deflectors, shields, louvers, or prismatic control devices shall
be used to eliminate nuisance and hazardous lighting to facilitate compliance
with this requirement.
      6.   Parking Structures: Luminaries used for illumination of designated
pedestrian walkways in parking structures (parking areas serving more than 2
residential dwellings or any nonresidential land use within a structure with 1
or more levels) shall be of a significantly different color value than
luminaries used for illuminating vehicle parking and drive aisles. (Ord. 18-08,
6-3-2019)
10-26-4: COMPLIANCE:
   (A)   Any new lighting installed after the effective date of this title
shall be in compliance with the requirements of this title. Any lighting in
existence before the effective date of this title that does not comply with
these requirements shall be considered legally nonconforming and may remain,
subject to the following provisions:
      1.   Alterations To Existing Lighting:
         (a)   When poles and support structures are removed and replaced for
reasons other than acts of God or accidents, they must be replaced with poles
and supports that comply with this chapter.
         (b)   When luminaries are replaced, they must be replaced with
luminaries that comply with all provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Removal And Replacement Of Parking Lot Surface: A parking lot or
portion thereof shall be considered "removed and replaced" when any portion of
the existing parking surface material is removed and a new surface is
installed. When less than fifty percent (50%) of the gross area of the parking
lot surface on a particular site is removed and replaced, only the parking area
replaced must be provided with lighting in compliance with this chapter. If
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the parking area on a particular site is
removed and replaced at one time, the entire parking lot on the site where the
construction activity occurs must be in full compliance with this chapter.
      3.   New Parking Lots Or Parking Lot Additions: When a new parking lot or
addition to an existing parking lot is constructed, the new lot or lot addition
must be provided with lighting in compliance with this chapter.
      4.   Renovations: When the cost of renovation of the principal structure
reaches the thresholds detailed in this title, all existing lighting shall be
brought into compliance to the extent required in this chapter.
      5.   New Structures, Additions, Or Replacements: When a site is improved
with new structures, additions to, or replacements of existing structures, the
lighting for the new structure, addition or replacement on the site must be
upgraded with complying lighting. The parking lot lighting must be upgraded
with complying lighting over a portion of the parking area that is equivalent
to the amount of parking that would be required for the new structure, addition
or replacement. In the event that the new structure, addition or replacement is
accompanied by a new or replaced parking area, the amount of upgraded lighting
area shall be that required under this chapter.
      6.   Development Application: When a development application is made for
a site for a nonadministrative permit, the East Moline Plan Commission or East
Moline City Council, may as a condition of approval, require compliance with
any or all of the standards of this chapter; and the extent of compliance
required in such cases may be greater than that otherwise required in this
chapter, if deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health, safety,
or welfare and to achieve the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)
10-26-5: POINT OF MEASUREMENTS:
Any light intensity measurement taken at the property line shall be measured at
the greatest point of illumination of said property line. Any measurements to
determine the minimum and maximum lighting levels internal to a site will be
measured by positioning the light meter horizontally at ground level at the
greatest and least points of artificial illumination. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)
10-26-6: PUD MODIFICATIONS:
   (A)   Modifications to the requirements of this section may be approved as
part of a final development plan for a planned development, as per chapter 27
of this title, pursuant to the provisions provided:
      1.   That any deviations from lighting standards established by this
chapter are clearly delineated in the plan submission reviewed by the East
Moline Plan Commission.
      2.   That any deviations are consistent with the purposes of this
chapter.
      3.   That the minimum light level proposed provides a minimum of seventy
five percent (75%) of the illumination required in this chapter.
      4.   That the height of support poles above grade does not exceed the
maximum permitted by this chapter by more than twenty five percent (25%),
except that no development shall be allowed for increased support pole height
within five hundred feet (500') of a Residential Zoning District.
      5.   That no increase in glare occurs as a result of deviation from the
adopted standards. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)

10-27-2: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is to promote to the
extent possible:
   (A)   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public
by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of this title.
   (B)   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
   (C)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic,
and geologic features.
   (D)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development, design and the construction of aesthetic
amenities.
   (E)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, and other facilities.
   (F)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals,
and welfare.
The PUD District is intended to provide for a development incorporating a
single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a
unit but departs from the normal standards and requirements of other sections
of this title.
The planned unit development may provide amenities not otherwise required by
law and may establish facilities and open space greater than the minimums
required by law. Such development may consist of conventionally subdivided lots
or provide for development by a land use and zoning plan which establishes the
location and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping
with the purpose of the plan.
The foregoing purposes and principals shall not be interpreted to permit the
reduction of standards set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)

conditions as they may deem necessary to insure conformance with the intent of
all comprehensive plan elements, the stated purpose of the Planned Development
District and established City policies.
      6.   Approval Of Preliminary PUD: Approval of a preliminary planned unit
development plan shall not constitute approval of the final plan. Rather it
shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the
preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the final plan which will be
submitted for approval of the City. The final plan shall be approved as the
final land use and zoning plan if it conforms substantially with the
preliminary land use and zoning plan.
The final plan may be considered as a preliminary and final plan and may be
submitted for preliminary and final approval, if all of the land is to be
developed at one time, and if all requirements hereof are met.
   (C)   Approval Of Final Plan: The final planned unit development plan shall
be submitted to the zoning official who shall refer same to the Plan Commission
and City Council. The final PUD plan shall conform to the preliminary PUD plan
as approved or subject to minor changes, and may be submitted in stages with
each stage reflecting the approved preliminary plan; provided, however, that
such stage conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required
procedure for approval of a final plan shall be:
      1.   A final planned unit development plan and other supporting data
required for approval shall be in accord with the provisions of this section.
Final plans must be submitted for approval in accordance with agreed-to
scheduling, but not later than five (5) years from the approval of the
preliminary plan by the City Council. The City Council may grant an extension
in time or the developer may resubmit an application; in the event that same is
not done, the City Council shall initiate such zoning changes as it deems
necessary to preserve the public interest. If construction falls more than two
(2) years behind the schedule filed with the final plan, the plan becomes
subject to revocation. The zoning official shall monitor all pending PUD
projects and inform the City Council of those six (6) months or more behind
schedule.
      2.   After review of the final plan, the Plan Commission shall submit the
planned unit development plan to the City Council with a recommendation for
approval, disapproval, or approval with minor modifications as reviewed at the
public hearing. Any changes or modifications which arise subsequent to the
public hearing shall be specifically noted and referred to the City Council who
shall determine whether the change constitutes a major or minor change and
whether another public hearing is required.
      3.   Following Plan Commission review, the final plan and supporting data
shall be submitted to the City Council for recommendations and approval, and
then City Council for certification that the final plan is in conformity with
these regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plan.
      4.   The City Council shall, within sixty (60) days, approve, disapprove,
or extend the time period for another sixty (60) days in taking action on the
final plan.

10-31-1.2: JURISDICTION:
This chapter shall be applicable within the corporate limits of the City of
East Moline and within all unincorporated territory located within one and one-
half (11/2) miles of said limits, provided such territory is not located within

Every provision of this chapter shall be construed liberally to achieve the
purposes outlined in section
10-31-1.1 of this section

   (A)   More Restrictive Requirements Apply: Whenever the requirements of this
chapter differ from those of any statute, lawfully adopted ordinance or
regulation, easement, covenant, or deed restriction, the more stringent
requirement shall prevail. Thus, in accordance with State law 1 , whenever this
chapter imposes higher standards than the County Subdivision Ordinance, said
higher standards shall supersede the County regulations in the unincorporated
territory located within the City of East Moline's subdivision jurisdiction.
This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, deed
restriction, or any other private agreement or restriction; provided, that,
where the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher
standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, deed restriction, or
other private agreement or restriction, the provisions of this chapter shall
govern. Where the provisions of the easement, covenant, deed restriction, or
private agreement or restriction impose duties and obligations more
restrictive, or higher standards than the requirements of this chapter or the
determinations of the City in approving a subdivision or in enforcing this
chapter, and such private provisions are not inconsistent with this chapter or
determinations thereunder, then such private provisions shall be operative and
supplemental to this chapter and determinations made thereunder. The City does
not purport to enforce any such private provisions not reflected on the plat
and its supporting documents and unless there is expressed in the nature of the
document and the approval process an intent to give the City enforcement rights
over same. (Ord. 91-2, 1-21-1991; amd. Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)

   (A)   Horizontal Curvatures: All changes in horizontal alignment shall be
conducted with a horizontal curve with the following minimum centerline radius,
designated "R":
      1.   For principal, minor and collector streets (design speed = 35 mph),
R shall equal five hundred feet (500');
      2.   For local streets (design speed - 30 mph), R shall equal one hundred
twenty five feet (125'); and
      3.   For alleys, R shall equal one hundred feet (100').
   (B)   Through Traffic Discouraged: Marginal access and local streets shall
be laid out so as to discourage use by through traffic. The rigid rectangular
gridiron street pattern should be avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable
street layout.
   (C)   Limited Access To Arterials: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the Planning Commission may recommend to
the City Council that access to said arterial may be limited by one of the
following means:
      1.   The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial street
and front onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access-restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and generally at right angles to the arterial street; or
      3.   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points.
   (D)   Dead-End Streets:
      1.   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire and police
protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
comports with the Municipal comprehensive plan. If the adjacent property is
owned by the developer (under the same ownership) and undeveloped and the
street must dead-end temporarily, the right- of-way shall be extended to the
property line, and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets
shall be reserved. A temporary turnaround shall be provided at the terminus of
any temporary dead-end street. If the adjacent property is under another
ownership there should be a permanent dead-end.
      2.   Permanent Dead-End Streets: Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length
of seven hundred fifty feet (750'). A cul-de-sac turn- around, having a minimum
right-of-way diameter of ninety eight feet (98'), a minimum pavement return
radius twenty five feet (25'), and a pavement diameter of seventy five feet
(75'), shall be provided at the end of every permanent dead-end street.
   (E)   Alleys: Alleys shall be prohibited in Single-Family Residence
Districts. Alleys may be required in Multiple-Family Districts and in
Commercial/Industrial Districts unless other adequate provisions for service
access are made. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the
terminus of any dead- end alley.
   (F)   Intersections:
      1.   Only Two Streets: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at
any point.
      2.   Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles; in no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less than eighty degrees (80°) or more than one hundred degrees
(100°). An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall
be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at least one
hundred feet (100') therefrom.
      3.   Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on
the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less
than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall not be permitted, except where
the intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either
intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
      4.   Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the
minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) streets shall be fifteen
feet (15') where both streets are marginal access or local and at other
intersections, not less than twenty five feet (25').
      5.   Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade of five-
tenths of one percent (0.5%). In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than
a two percent (2%) slope for a distance of sixty feet (60') from the nearest
right-of-way line of the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach
to an intersection.
      6.   Cross-Slope: The cross-slopes of all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed three percent (3%).
      7.   Adequate Sight Lines: Where any street intersection will involve
earth banks or existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and/or
vegetation (including trees) in connection with the grading of the public
right-of-way to the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance in
accordance with the following chart:
 
30 mph 130 ft. each way from intersection
35 mph 155 ft. each way from intersection
 
For design speeds exceeding thirty five (35) miles per hour (35 mph), sight
distance will be determined based upon AASHTO criteria.
   (G)   Reverse Curves: A tangent at least fifty feet (50') long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on local streets and one hundred feet (100')
long on collector streets.
   (H)   Road Dedications And Reservations And Improvements To Existing
Streets:
      1.   New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half- streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning
Commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right-of-way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
      2.   Existing Roads: Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road
or when the Comprehensive Plan, Official Map, or zoning setback regulations
indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of
some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve
and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or realignment of such
roads as are specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision and to
reserve for public use any portion of the right-of-way determined not to be
specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision.
      3.   Excess Right-Of-Way: Right-of-way in excess of the standards set
forth in the Table of Street Design Specifications shall be required to be
dedicated when:
         (a)   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes; or
         (b)   Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is
needed to construct overpasses, underpasses, and approaches thereto.
      4.   "Specifically And Uniquely Attributable" Defined: For purposes of
this section, the phrase "specifically and uniquely attributable" shall mean as
a minimum that areas currently zoned or to be zoned Single-Family for
residential uses in the Comprehensive Plan shall require marginal access,
local, or collector streets, depending on density; that areas currently zoned
or to be zoned for multi-family residential uses in the Comprehensive Plan
shall require local, boulevard, collector, minor arterial, or principal
arterial streets, depending on density; that areas currently zoned or to be
zoned for commercial uses in the Comprehensive Plan shall require local,
collector, minor arterial, or principal arterial streets, depending on whether
same is a neighborhood, community, or regional area; and that areas currently
zoned or to be zoned for industrial uses in the Comprehensive Plan shall
require collector, minor arterial, or principal arterial streets, depending on
the size of the industrial area. (Ord. 91-2, 1-21-1991; amd. Ord. 18-08, 6-3-

10-31-3.15: DEDICATIONS FOR PUBLIC USE:
The City Council may require the developer to dedicate (i.e., to transfer
without compensation) to the City of East Moline or other appropriate
governmental entity suitable parcel(s) of land within the subdivision for
public purposes provided such facilities are otherwise required by this
chapter. Any such dedicated area shall be shown on the final plat.
   (A)   Reservations For Public Use: Besides requiring the developer to
dedicate parcels for public purposes, the City Council may require that he
reserve land for parks, playgrounds, schools, or other public purposes in
locations designated in the City's comprehensive plan. Since public acquisition
of reserved land requires compensation, it is not essential that the need for
such land be uniquely and specifically attributable to the subdivision 1 .
      1.   Adopted: There is hereby adopted an Official Map dated July 18,
1966, which shall be applicable to all land situated within the City, and shall
also be applicable to contiguous territory within one and one-half (11/2) miles
from the corporate limits of the City and not included within the corporate
limits of any other municipality. The Official Map shall be filed in the Office
of the City Clerk and is made part of this chapter by reference.
      2.   Planned Public Improvements To Be Shown On Map: The Official Map may
show indication of sites for planned public facilities. Public facility sites
which may be indicated on the Official Map may include but are not limited to:
sites for new trafficways or widening of existing trafficways; school sites;
recreational sites; public building sites; and sites for future storm drainage,
electrical or other public service or utility easements.
      3.   Availability Of Sites For Planned Public Improvements:
         (a)   Whenever the Official Map indicates the necessity for providing
a site for a planned public facility, the Council may require that the site for
the public use be designated on the subdivision plat before granting approval
to such plat; and, furthermore, that the site be held for that specific public
use for a period of one year from the date of approval of the final plat. When
such designation has been required, the Council shall notify the responsible
public agency in writing of the designation within ten (10) days.
         (b)   Whenever a site for public use, shown on the Official Map, has
been required to be indicated on a subdivision plat, the responsible agency
having jurisdiction of such use shall acquire the land so designated by
purchase or commence proceedings to acquire the land by condemnation within one
year from date of final approval of the plat; and, if it does not do so within
such period of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners
in any other manner consistent with this chapter, this title, or any other
provision of this Code or other ordinance of the City.
      4.   Amendments Or Additions To The Official Map: Amendments to the
Official Map, including the indication of additional public sites to be shown
on the map, shall be considered amendments to this chapter and therefore shall
be as specified in this chapter for amendments to this chapter. Any public
agency requesting the establishment of the Official Map of a future public site
or easement which is not included in the Comprehensive Plan, shall indicate to
the Plan Commission the need for the site in the particular location specified.
The Plan Commission, before making a favorable recommendation for the inclusion
on the Official Map of such site by the Council, shall find that this public
site location is determined to be necessary to provide public service
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of the community and shall so indicate
in its minutes. (Ord. 91-2, 1-21-1991; amd. Ord. 18-08, 6-3-2019)
