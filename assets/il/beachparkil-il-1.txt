EXHIBIT A
 
13.08.170: DELINQUENT PAYMENT:
    A.   1. Notice to Owner: Whenever a bill for sewer service, when provided
without Village water, is over $100.00 and remains unpaid 30 days after it has
become due, the Village Administrator shall direct the superintendent of public
works to notify the owner of record and the tenant, if applicable, that if the
account balance is not paid in full within 30 days of notice to pay in full,
the Village will start the disconnect proceedings.
        2.   Payment Of Services: Said rates or charges for service, as
established by the Village, shall be payable quarterly. If there is a tenant
who is the payer of the account, the owner of the property shall still be
liable to pay for the service to such premises in the event the tenant does not
pay. The service is furnished to the premises by the Village or its authorized
agent only upon the condition that the owner of the premises is liable therefor
to the Village.
        3.   Notice Of Disconnection: Notice of disconnection shall be given to
the account holder and owner of the premises at least 14 days prior to the
disconnection by either certified mail or personal service. The notice shall
include the right for the owner to request a hearing by the Village
Administrator and shall contain compliance dates regarding the aforementioned
hearing, due date for full payment and the scheduled disconnect date. Any
account not paid in accordance with the notice shall have the service property
posted with a placard indicating the scheduled disconnection date and posting
notice, along with a copy of the original notice, not less than two days prior
to the planned disconnection date. If a user account goes unpaid for 90 days
after the initial invoice date, a fee shall be added to the account for the
disconnection and the Public Works Department will disconnect the sanitary
sewer at the main. Any costs incurred by the Village after the user account is
in arrears shall be paid by the owner of the premises. Any owner, who requests
reconnection to the Village's sanitary sewer system after a disconnection,
shall pay to the Village all of the Village's costs incurred for the
disconnection and reconnection including, but not limited to, an inspection
fee, as established by the Village from time to time as defined by the Village
Fee Schedule.
        4.   Condemnation: Property subject to a disconnection for unpaid sewer
charges shall be subject to condemnation for uninhabitable premises. The
Village will institute condemnation proceedings in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which a sewer has been
disconnected.
        5.   Lien: In addition, the Village may file a sworn and certified
notice of lien claim with the Lake County Recorder of Deeds. This notice of
lien claim shall include a description or permanent index number of the real
estate sufficient for the identification thereof, the amount of money due for
such services, including costs of disconnection, legal expenses, penalties,
interest and carrying charges, if any, and the date when such amount became
delinquent. The Village may, in addition to or instead of mailing to the owner,
mail notice of the delinquency or lien to the person or entity at the address
disclosed on the tax assessment records as the person or entity to whom was
mailed the most recent ascertainable real estate tax bill for the subject
premises. The failure of the Village to record the lien, or to mail the notice
of delinquency or lien to the owner of the subject premises, or the failure of
the owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the right of the Village to
foreclose the lien or otherwise collect the amounts then due to the fullest
extent authorized by law. The remedies available to the Village, whether in
foreclosure, collection or otherwise, shall be cumulative and not exclusive.
In addition to the rates and charges stated above, whenever the Village
prepares and records a notice of lien for delinquencies as provided above, the
costs of preparation of such notice, filing and releasing such lien shall be
paid in full prior to the release of such lien.
    B.   Whenever a bill for Village sanitary sewer system service remains
unpaid 30 days after a lien is filed, the person whose name appears on the bill
and the property owner shall be found in violation of an offense against the
Village. Each such person is guilty of a separate offense for each and every
day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of the
ordinances of the Village is committed, continued or permitted by any such
person, and such person is punishable accordingly. Each person shall be subject
to a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense plus
any and all costs involved to prosecute, terminate service or to collect on
unpaid balances.

CHAPTER 2.43
CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT
 
2.43.010: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a fair and efficient system of
enforcement of Village ordinances as may be allowed by law and directed by
ordinance, through the administrative adjudication of violations of such
Village ordinances and by establishing a schedule of fines and penalties, and
authority and procedures for collection of unpaid fines and penalties.
2.43.020: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the words described below shall have the
meanings ascribed to them herein unless the context in which such terms are
used requires otherwise:
Code means any municipal ordinance, law, rule, regulation or code set forth in
Titles 3 through 10, inclusive, except such ordinances for which the potential
penalty described therein includes a period of incarceration.
Owner means (1) for the purpose of a violation relating to real property, the
person to whom the Lake County Collector sent the last ascertainable tax bill
or the listed owner according to Lake County; and (2) for the purpose of a
violation relating to motor vehicles, the person to whom the motor vehicle is
registered, as provided by the records of the Secretary of State of Illinois.
Any person so described herein may present evidence to overcome the presumption
that such person is the owner of the property and/or motor vehicle for which
the person received a notice of violation.
Hearing Officer means a person appointed by the Village Administrator to
preside over administrative hearings, as set forth in this chapter.
2.43.030: NON-EXCLUSIVITY:
The provisions of this chapter shall not preclude the Village from using other
methods or proceedings to enforce the Village Code, including, but not limited
to, the institution of any action in the Circuit Court of Lake County,
Illinois, or any administrative proceeding.
2.43.040: CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT; ESTABLISHMENT; JURISDICTION:
There is hereby created within the Village of Beach Park a Code Hearing
Department, which is authorized to provide for and operate a "system of
administrative adjudication," as more fully described herein, which shall have
jurisdiction over the adjudication and enforcement of any violation of the
Village Code.
2.43.050: CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT; ORGANIZATION:
The Code Hearing Department shall be comprised of a Hearing Officer, a Code
Administrator, and any other duly appointed person or persons deemed necessary
for the efficient administration of the Code Hearing Department, with the
following powers and authority:
A.   Hearing Officer: All adjudicatory hearings shall be presided over by a
Hearing Officer. Prior to conducting administrative adjudication hearings, the
Hearing Officer shall have successfully completed a formal training program
which includes the following:
1.   Instruction on the rules of procedure of the administrative adjudication
hearings that they will conduct and preside over;
2.   Orientation to each subject area of the Code for which they may adjudicate
a violation;
3.   Observation of administrative adjudication hearings; and
4.   Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence and
issuing final orders.
In addition, a Hearing Officer must be an attorney licensed to practice law in
the State of Illinois for at least three years. A Hearing Officer may not be an
inspector or law enforcement officer employed by the Village.
The Hearing Officer is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to:
1.   Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the existence of an
ordinance violation;
2.   Issue subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give relevant testimony
or tangible items at an administrative adjudication hearing, upon the request

hearings, including all exhibits and evidence introduced at the hearing;
4.   Issue a determination, based on the evidence presented at the
administrative adjudication hearing, of whether a Code violation occurred or
exists. The Hearing Officer’s determination shall be in writing and shall
include written findings of fact and law, a decision, and an order including
the fine, penalty or other action with which the defendant must comply; and
5.   Impose penalties consistent with the applicable Code and assess costs upon
finding a party liable for the charged violation, except, however, that in no
event shall the Hearing Officer have authority (i) to impose a penalty of
incarceration, or (ii) impose a fine in excess of $50,000.00. The maximum
monetary fine under this item 5. shall be exclusive of costs of enforcement or
costs incurred by the Village to secure compliance with the Code and shall not
be applicable to cases to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and
collected by the Village.
B.   Code Administrator: The Code Administrator shall either be and employee of
the Village of Beach Park appointed by the Village Administrator, of an
independent contractor or agency contracted by the Village to perform such

2.   Adopt, distribute and process all notices as may be required under this
chapter or as may reasonably be required to carry out the purpose of this
chapter;
3.   Collect moneys paid as fines and/or penalties assessed after a final
determination of liability;

pursuant to this chapter, and any factual reports verifying the final
determination of any violation liability which were issued in accordance with
this chapter or the laws of the State of Illinois, including 625 ILCS 5/11-
208.3, as from time to time amended.
5.   Certify reports to the Secretary of State concerning initiation of
suspension of driving privileges in accordance with the provisions of this

6.   Promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary for the efficient
operation and maintenance of the system of administrative adjudication hereby
established; and
7.   Collect unpaid fines and penalties through private collection agencies
that may be retained by the Village or by requesting the Village Prosecutor to
act on behalf of the Village in filing complaints in the Lake County Circuit
Court, seeking judgments for unpaid fines or penalties and pursuing all post-
judgment remedies available under current law.
C.   Automation: The Code Administrator is hereby further authorized, empowered
and permitted to operate and maintain a computer program for the system of
administrative adjudication hereby established, on a day-to-day basis,
including, but not limited to:
1.   Inputting of violation notice information;
2.   Establishing hearing dates and notice dates;
3.   Recording fine and penalty assessment and payments;
4.   Issuing payment receipts;

liability. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the Code
Administrator from including one or more of the above notices in the same
notice report; and
6.   Keeping accurate records of appearances and non-appearances at
administrative adjudication hearing, pleas entered and fines and other
penalties assessed and paid.

Lake County, Illinois; and
3.   Perform such other duties or acts as may be reasonably required and as
directed by the Hearing Officer or the Code Administrator.
2.43.060: COMPENSATION OF CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL:
Authorization for compensation for each of the above-stated positions shall be
made by the Village Board through the annual budget or appropriation process.
Compensation shall be determined by the Village Administrator within an
approved budget or appropriation limitations.
2.43.070: COMMENCEMENT OF HEARINGS:
A.   A proceeding before a Hearing Officer shall be instituted upon the filing
with the Code Administrator of a written sworn pleading, complaint or citation
by any authorized official of the Village, including police officers, code
enforcement officers, and such other employees as authorized.
B.   Defendants shall be served with a copy of the written sworn pleading,
complaint or citation along with a notice of hearing in a manner reasonably
calculated to give them actual notice of the proceeding instituted against
them, by one of the following means:
1.   Personal service upon a party or its authorized agent;
2.   Service by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last
known address;
3.   Service by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the party's last known
address; or
4.   If the party's last known address cannot be ascertained after a diligent
search, by posting a copy of the sworn pleading, complaint or citation in a
conspicuous place upon the property or motor vehicle where the violation is
found when the party is the owner of the property or motor vehicle.
5.   Any notice presented by first class or certified mail, or by posting,
shall be deemed served three days after the deposit of such notice in the U.S.
Mail or the posting of such notice.
C.   Notices of hearing shall include:
1.   The type and nature of the ordinance violation to be adjudicated,
including a citation to the appropriate section of the Code;
2.   The date and time the violation was observed.
3.   The date and time of the administrative adjudication hearing;
4.   The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be
held;
5.   The penalties for failure to appear at the hearing; and
6.   The name(s) of witness(es) to the violation.
D.   Administrative adjudication hearings shall be scheduled and docketed by
the Code Administrator no less than 15 and no more than 45 days after the
notice of hearing is served on the defendant.
2.43.080: HEARING PROCEDURES:
A.   Parties shall be provided with an opportunity for a hearing before or
during which they may exercise any or all of the following rights:
1.   Be represented by counsel, although defendants shall not be entitled to
have an attorney appointed to represent them;
2.   Present and cross-examine witnesses;
3.   Request the Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas to direct the attendance
and testimony of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant tangible
evidence.
B.   Rules of evidence shall not govern. The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in an administrative adjudication hearing authorized
under this chapter. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is
the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of
their affairs.
C.   Standard of proof. Administrative adjudication hearings are civil in
nature. The Village shall bear the standard of proof to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the occurrence or existence of a violation of the
Code. A sworn, written pleading, complaint or citation shall constitute prima
facie evidence of the violation.
D.   Defenses. It shall be a defense to a Code violation charged under this
chapter if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent or representative proves
to the Hearing Officer’s satisfaction that:
1.   The Code violation alleged in the notice did not in fact exist at the time
of the citation, pleading or complaint;
2.   The Code violation has been caused by the current property occupants and
that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to maintain the dwelling free
of such violations, the current occupants continue to cause the violations; or
3.   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the owner or
his agent to all or a part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting the
Code violation(s).
4.   The Code violation alleged in the notice occurred before the owner became
of owner of the real or personal property. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, any existing order to correct a Code violation and/or sanctions
imposed by the Village as a result of a finding of a Code violation under this
chapter shall attached to the property as well as to the owner of the property,
so that a finding of a Code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by
conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent
transferee or owner of the property takes the same subject to the findings,
decision and order of a Hearing Officer under this chapter.
E.   Continuances. No continuances shall be authorized by a Hearing Officer for
any administrative adjudication hearing commenced under this chapter except in
cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the
defendant or owner. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance.
Any continuance authorized by a Hearing Officer shall not exceed 60 days.
F.   Judicial review. Any final decision by a Hearing Officer that a Code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law, 735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq., or as hereinafter amended.
Any person filing for judicial review under the Administrative Review Law shall
be subject to the assessment of costs for the preparation and certification of
the record of proceedings before the Hearing Officer. Such cost shall be
assessed as $100.00 for the first page of the transcript and $25.00 for each
page thereafter. Any failure to pay such fee shall subject the party seeking
review to the provisions of 735 ILCS 5/3-109, including dismissal of the
complaint on motion of the Village.
2.43.090: ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
A.   Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction or cost imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the
failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law are a debt due and owing the Village of Beach Park and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
B.   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of an
ordinance violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
C.   In any case in which a defendant has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering that defendant to correct an ordinance violation or imposing any fine
or other sanction as a result of an ordinance violation, any expenses incurred
by the Village to enforce the judgment entered against that defendant,
including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, and costs related
to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due and owing the
Village of Beach Park and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
Prior to any expenses being fixed by the Hearing Officer pursuant to this
subsection C., the Code Administrator shall serve a notice to the defendant
that states that defendant shall appear at a hearing before the Hearing Officer
to determine whether the defendant has failed to comply with the judgment. The
notice shall set forth the date for such hearing, which shall not be less than
seven days from the date service is effective, as provided in section 2-10-7.
D.   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/12-101 et seq.), or by the Uniform
Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq.), a lien shall be imposed on the real
estate or personal property, or both, of the defendant in the amount of any
debt due and owing the Village under this chapter. The lien may be enforced in
the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.
E.   The Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set
a new hearing date, upon a petition filed by the defendant within 30 days after
the issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing Officer determines that
the defendant's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause, or at any
time if the defendant establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the
Village did not provide proper service of process. In addition, for the purpose
of motor vehicle violations, the grounds for the petition may include: (1) the
person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the
parking violation notice was first issued; or (2) the person having already
paid the fine or penalty for the parking violation in question.
If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this subsection, the Hearing Officer
shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has been
recorded for any debt due and owing the Village as a result of the vacated
default judgment. The petitioner shall appear with appropriate evidence, so
that if the petition is granted, he is prepared to proceed immediately with a
hearing on the merits.
2.43.100: PARKING, STANDING OR COMPLIANCE NOTICE VIOLATIONS:
  A.   1. Parking, Standing or Compliance Notice Warning Violation: A warning
violation notice may be issued at the discretion of the enforcing body. Warning
tickets are strongly encouraged for first time offenses. The warning ticket
shall specify the date, time and place of the violation and the particular
regulation violated.
       2.   A Parking, Standing or Compliance Notice Violation: The notice
violation shall include:
          a.   The date, time and place of the violation;
          b.   The particular regulation violated;
          c.   The fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment,
when so provided by ordinance;
          d.   The vehicle make and state registration number;
          e.   The identification number of the person issuing the notice;
          f.   State that payment of the indicated fine, and of any applicable
penalty for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of the
violation; and
          g.   Contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which
the violation may be contested on its merits.
 
B.   1. Service Of Parking, Standing, Or Compliance Violation Notice: Service
of the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may be achieved by
affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked
vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he/she is
present. A person authorized by this chapter to issue and serve parking,
standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness
of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his/her name to the
notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a
computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic
compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced
by the device while it was under his/her control. The original or a facsimile
of the violation notice shall be retained by the traffic compliance
administrator, and there shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of
business. A parking, standing, or compliance violation notice issued, signed
and served in accordance with this section, or a copy of the notice, shall be
prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the
facts shown on the notice. The notice or copy shall be admissible in any
subsequent administrative adjudication or legal proceedings.
       2.   Service Of Additional Notices: Service of additional notices may be
sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the
registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the secretary of state,
or, under section 11-1306 of the Illinois vehicle code, to the lessee of the
cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at
the time of lease. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of
deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following
sequence and shall include, but not be limited to, the information specified
herein.
          a.   A second notice of violation shall:
             (1)   Specify the date and location of the violation cited in the
parking, standing, or compliance violation notice;
             (2)   Specify the particular regulation violated;
             (3)   Specify the vehicle make and state registration number;
             (4)   Specify the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for
late payment when so provided by ordinance;
             (5)   Specify the availability of a hearing in which the violation
may be contested on its merits;
             (6)   Specify the time and manner in which the hearing may be had;
             (7)   State that failure either to pay the indicated fine and any
applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and
manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability
for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated;
             (8)   State that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of
violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to
exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid
fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the Village of Beach Park.
          b.   A notice of final determination of parking, standing, or
compliance violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final
determination of parking, standing, or compliance violation liability and the
conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this section. The notice
shall:
             (1)   State that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and
owing the municipality;
             (2)   Contain warnings that failure to pay any fine or penalty due
and owing the municipality within the time specified may result in the
municipality's filing a petition in the circuit court to have the unpaid fine
or penalty rendered a judgment as provided by this section.
 
C.   An opportunity for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle cited
in the parking, standing or compliance violation notice in which the owner may
contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or
technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under
section 11-1306 of the Illinois vehicle code, to the lessee of a vehicle cited
in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing
of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded,
and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance
administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena
both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant
books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this subsection may be
represented by counsel at their expense.
D.   A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure
to pay the fine or penalty after a Hearing Officer's determination of violation
liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review
procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing
to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior
mailed notice, the Hearing Officer's determination of violation liability shall
become final:
 
       1.   Upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination;
or
       2.   Upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a
filing having been made.
A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing or liability may
be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty and shall be filed within
30 days of the finding of liability and ruled upon by the compliance
administrator within 30 days thereafter. The grounds for such a petition are
limited to: a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, b) the person having
already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question and c) excusable
failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. After the
determination of violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just
cause, the person owing the unpaid fine or penalty shall be provided with a
hearing on the merits for the violation.
E.   If the alleged violator does not reside within the state of Illinois, he
or she may contest the violation in writing. In such circumstances, the Hearing
Officer must receive a request in writing from the nonresident to contest the
violation seven days prior to the initial hearing. If the Hearing Officer
receives such a written request, the nonresident may submit his or her
position, in writing, as to why the issuance of the violation was improper.

building code violation charged if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent
or representative proves to the hearing officer's satisfaction that:
      1.   The building code violation alleged in the notice does not in fact
exist, or at the time of the hearing, the violation has been remedied or
removed;
      2.   The building code violation has been caused by the current property
occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to maintain the
dwelling free of such violations, the current occupants continue to cause the
violations;
      3.   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
owner or his agent to all or part of the dwelling for the purpose of correcting
the building code violation.
   D.   Sanctions Applicable To Owner; Property: The order to correct a
building code violation and the sanction imposed by the village as the result
of a finding of a building code violation under this chapter shall attach to
the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a
building code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or
transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner
of property takes subject to the findings, decision and order of a hearing
officer under this chapter. (Ord. 2005-O-41 § 1: Ord. 2023-O-2 § 1)

the violation may be contested on its merits.
   B.   1. Service Of Parking, Standing, Or Compliance Violation Notice:
Service of the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may be
achieved by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully
parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he/she
is present. A person authorized by this chapter to issue and serve parking,
standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness
of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his/her name to the
notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a
computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic
compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced
by the device while it was under his/her control. The original or a facsimile
of the violation notice shall be retained by the traffic compliance
administrator, and there shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of
business. A parking, standing, or compliance violation notice issued, signed
and served in accordance with this section, or a copy of the notice, shall be
prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the
facts shown on the notice. The notice or copy shall be admissible in any
subsequent administrative adjudication or legal proceedings.
      2.   Service Of Additional Notices: Service of additional notices may be
sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the
registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the secretary of state,
or, under section 11-1306 of the Illinois vehicle code, to the lessee of the
cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at
the time of lease. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of
deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following
sequence and shall include, but not be limited to, the information specified
herein.
         a.   A second notice of violation shall:
            (1)   Specify the date and location of the violation cited in the
parking, standing, or compliance violation notice;
            (2)   Specify the particular regulation violated;
            (3)   Specify the vehicle make and state registration number;
            (4)   Specify the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for
late payment when so provided by ordinance;
            (5)   Specify the availability of a hearing in which the violation
may be contested on its merits;
            (6)   Specify the time and manner in which the hearing may be had;
            (7)   State that failure either to pay the indicated fine and any
applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and
manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability
for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated;
            (8)   State that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of
violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to
exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid
fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the village of Beach Park.
         b.   A notice of final determination of parking, standing, or
compliance violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final
determination of parking, standing, or compliance violation liability and the
conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this section. The notice
shall:
            (1)   State that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing
the municipality;
            (2)   Contain warnings that failure to pay any fine or penalty due
and owing the municipality within the time specified may result in the
municipality's filing a petition in the circuit court to have the unpaid fine
or penalty rendered a judgment as provided by this section, or may result in
suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines or
penalties for ten (10) or more parking violations under section 6-306.5 of the
Illinois vehicle code.
         c.   A notice of impending driver's license suspension shall:
            (1)   Be sent to the person liable for any fine or penalty that
remains due and owing on ten (10) or more parking violations;
            (2)   State that failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within
forty five (45) days of the notice's date will result in the municipality
notifying the secretary of state that the person is eligible for initiation of
suspension proceedings under section 6-306.5 of the Illinois vehicle code;
            (3)   State that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an
original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped
envelope to the municipality along with a request for the copy;
            (4)   Be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid,
to the address recorded with the secretary of state.
   C.   An opportunity for a hearing for the registered owner of the vehicle
cited in the parking, standing or compliance violation notice in which the
owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal
or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under
section 11-1306 of the Illinois vehicle code, to the lessee of a vehicle cited
in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing
of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded,
and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance
administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena
both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant
books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this subsection may be
represented by counsel at their expense.
   D.   A final determination of violation liability shall occur following
failure to pay the fine or penalty after a hearing officer's determination of
violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any
administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to
appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner
specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination of
violation liability shall become final:
      1.   Upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination; or
      2.   Upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a
filing having been made.
A petition to set aside a determination of parking, standing or liability may
be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty and shall be filed within
thirty (30) days of the finding of liability and ruled upon by the compliance
administrator within thirty (30) days thereafter. The grounds for such a
petition are limited to: a) the person not having been the owner or lessee of
the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, b) the person
having already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question and c)
excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. After the
determination of violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just
cause, the person owing the unpaid fine or penalty shall be provided with a
hearing on the merits for the violation.
   E.   If the alleged violator does not reside within the state of Illinois,
he or she may contest the violation in writing. In such circumstances, the
hearing officer must receive a request in writing from the nonresident to
contest the violation seven (7) days prior to the initial hearing. If the
hearing officer receives such a written request, the nonresident may submit his
or her position, in writing, as to why the issuance of the violation was
improper. (Ord. 2008-O-34 § 1: Ord. 2005-O-41 § 1)

approved amount in the budget for the specific fund, operation, project, or
department in question is not exceeded.

holding office, the annual budget for the village may be revised by deleting,

CHAPTER 3.12
DEVELOPMENT FEES AND COSTS
SECTION:
3.12.010: Professional Fees And Other Costs
3.12.010: PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER COSTS:
   A.   Any person or other legal entity seeking village's approval or
consideration of any matter shall be responsible for any professional fees or
other costs incurred by the village in reviewing the requested action or matter
and in acting upon the requested approval or consideration, including, but not
limited to, engineering fees, planning fees, attorney fees and other fees
incurred by the village.
   B.   Whenever any person or other entity is required by village ordinance or
rule, state or federal law, to submit plans, specifications or other documents
to the village engineer, attorney, consultant or other employee of the village,
for his review, comments and approval or disapproval, such person or entity
shall be responsible for the fees charged to the village in connection
therewith.
   C.   Whenever any person or other entity shall, of his or its own volition,
submit plans, specifications or other documents to the village engineer,
attorney, consultant or other employee of the village for his review, approval,
disapproval or comments upon said plans, specifications or other documents, the
person or entity submitting the same shall be responsible for the fees charged
by such employee in connection therewith.
   D.   The term "review" shall include, but not be limited to: conducting
hearings and meetings; processing, review, and preparation of documents;
evaluation of drawings for code compliance; legal, technical and professional
review and consultation; field inspections and preparations; and similar
consideration and review of proposed actions which involve the earthmoving of
land, construction or alteration of buildings, provision of utilities or other
public services, and uses and appearances of property. Said fees do not include
building permit fees, which are governed by chapter
15.08 of this code.
   E.   Any and all professional fees or other costs incurred are nonrefundable
once the review process has been started or completed.
   F.   In the event the professional fees or other costs are paid by check,
and the check is returned to the village by the financial institution due to
insufficient funds, the village shall suspend the review process. A cashier's
check that includes the required fees, a thirty dollar ($30.00) returned check
service charge, and any other costs that the village may incur thereby, shall
be deposited with the village before the village resumes the review process.
   G.   Development proceedings initiated by the village (i.e., text amendments
to the zoning ordinance) are exempt from such fees.
   H.   In the event the village board denies approval of any and all portions
of the petition, a petitioner shall remain liable for all fees and costs which
the village has incurred relative to the petition.
   I.   Any professional fees incurred as a direct or indirect result of the
petitioner, owner, or their agent, requesting a professional opinion or
otherwise requesting relief or assistance from the village, whether or not
related to real property, shall be reimbursed in accordance with this section.
The village, in its sole discretion, may determine whether a professional
opinion is necessary.
   J.   Upon the failure of the owner or petitioner to reimburse the village in
accordance with this section, the village shall send notice to the owner or
petitioner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the professional
or other fees are in arrears. No action on any request made by the owner or
petitioner will be acted upon by the village board or any other official,
quasi-official, or deliberative individual or body thereunder; and such request
shall remain in abeyance until all outstanding fees are paid in full. Until
such fees are paid in full, the village shall place a stop work order on the
project. Furthermore, if all outstanding fees are not paid in full pursuant to
this chapter, within seven (7) business days after the notice was mailed, the
application shall be considered withdrawn by the owner or petitioner. Interest
in the amount of one and one-half percent (11/2%) per month shall accrue on all
sums outstanding for thirty (30) days or more. Upon failure to reimburse the
village in accordance with this section, the village may, in its discretion,
elect to place a lien on any real property associated with petitioner's
request. Such lien shall be in an amount equal to the outstanding amount owed
to the village.
   K.   Should the village board, village staff, or the owner or petitioner
desire professional services, the village board and the designated village
staff members are authorized to assign requests for professional services to
the village staff or to consultants as the village board deems appropriate.
   L.   When any professional services contemplated by this section are
rendered by the village staff, then in such case the party making the request
shall reimburse the village for its costs incurred in providing said
professional services. Said reimbursement shall be at the rate of thirty
dollars ($30.00) per hour.
   M.   The remedies available to the village as set forth in this section are
nonexclusive and nothing herein shall be construed to limit or waive the
village's right to proceed against any or all parties in a court of law of
competent jurisdiction.
   N.   At the time the petitioner requests action from the village he will be
required to enter into an agreement with the village that contains the
parameters of this section.
   O.   If it is determined that there are outstanding professional fees or
costs not paid at the time an occupancy permit is granted, the village may
apply the funds deposited for a construction bond to any outstanding fees.

The term "cash bond" means and shall refer to any escrow, performance
guarantee, performance bond, completion guarantee, completion bond, or any
other financial security held by the village as provided below for purposes of
securing performance of any obligation or requirement of any ordinance,
regulation or administrative procedure of the village. (Ord. 1992-O-93 § 1)
3.15.020: WHEN REQUIRED:
Whenever any ordinance, regulation or administrative procedure of the village
requires that an escrow, performance guarantee, performance bond, completion
guarantee, completion bond, or any other financial security be given to the
village for the future performance of improvements to land, such as, but not
limited to, subdivision improvements, roadway construction, sewer excavation
and culvert, ditch, swale, or drainageway construction, the person or entity
required to provide such security may do so by way of posting a cash bond as
provided below. (Ord. 1992-O-93 § 1)
3.15.030: POSTING CASH BOND; AMOUNT:
A cash bond may be posted in lieu of a letter of credit as required by any
ordinance, regulation or administrative procedure of the village. Unless
otherwise provided for in the ordinance, regulation or administrative
procedure, the amount to be posted shall be equal to one hundred thirty percent
(130%) of the estimated cost of the improvement to land, as estimated by an
engineer employed by the person or entity required to provide such security,
and approved by the village attorney. This amount shall include the village
costs of administering the completion of the improvements to land in the event
of default. The cash bond shall be made payable to the village of Beach Park in
the form of a cashier's check, bank draft, certified check, or bank money
order. A certificate of deposit or other instrument which cannot be negotiated
by the village shall not be accepted. The deposit of a cash bond with the
village shall bear no interest to the depositor. The village may draw upon the
cash bond at any time during the time the bond is posted when such drawing is
authorized by village ordinance or regulation. (Ord. 1992-O-93 § 1)
3.15.040: RELEASE OF BOND:
Whenever a cash bond is held by the village as security for any improvement,
release of such bond shall only be made upon application for such release by
the depositor of the bond. The application for release shall be reviewed by the
village treasurer, who shall certify that the proper village authorities have

      1.   The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in
the village intrastate telecommunications by a person at the rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer by such person. To prevent actual multimunicipal

subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in
another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax
enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount
of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not previously
allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax. However, such tax is not
imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not,
under the constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject
of taxation by municipalities of the state of Illinois.
      2.   The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in
the village interstate telecommunications by a person at the rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at

multimunicipal taxation of such act or privilege that is subject to taxation
under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a
tax in another state or municipality in Illinois on such event or events, shall
be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in the state of Illinois. However, such tax is not imposed
on the act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the
constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation
by municipalities of the state of Illinois.
   B.   Collection Of Tax: The taxes authorized by this chapter shall be
collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in
the state of Illinois and making or effectuating the sale at retail and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the village. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to this chapter and any such tax collected by such retailer shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the village. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use.
Retailers filing tax returns pursuant to this chapter shall, at the time of
filing such return, pay to the village the amount of the tax imposed by this
chapter, less a commission of 1.75 percent of the tax collected and remitted
with the return. Such commission is allowed to reimburse the retailer for the
expenses incurred in keeping records, billing the customer, preparing and
filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon
request. No commission may be claimed by a retailer for tax not timely remitted
to the village.
   C.   Tax Returns:
      1.   On or before the last day of October 1995, each retailer shall make
a return to the village treasurer, for the months of July, August and September

         b.   The retailer's address for its principal place of business.

retailer shall make a like return to the village treasurer for the
corresponding three (3) month period. The retailer making the return provided
for in this section, shall, at the time of making such return, pay to the
village treasurer, the amount of tax imposed by this chapter; provided, that in
connection with any return the retailer may, if he so elects, report and pay an
amount based upon his total billings of business subject to the tax during the
period for which the return is due (exclusive of any amounts previously billed)
with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon any differences between
such billings and the taxable gross receipts. (Ord. 2014-O-37: Ord. 1995-O-25 §
1: Ord. 1995-O-11 § 1)
3.24.030: OVERPAYMENT OF TAX:
If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under
the provisions of this chapter, whether as the result of a mistake of fact or

administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting forth the
basis of the taxpayer's request for a hearing. The written protest and petition
for hearing must be filed with the local tax administrator within forty five

(45) day period. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 9)
3.30.100: HEARING:

regarding any appeal.

absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation
shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted shall not
exceed fourteen (14) days.
   C.   At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall hear
testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit or
assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

3.30.110: INTEREST AND PENALTIES:
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The village provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be five
percent (5%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was
required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a
failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 2000-O-
23 § 11)
3.30.120: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 12)
3.30.130: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working dates to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 13)
3.30.140: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of
the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
Village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 14)
3.30.150: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 15)
3.30.160: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered Tax Ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a Tax Ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all Tax
Ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's Office. (Ord. 2000-O-23 § 16)
3.30.170: LIENS:
The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the Village expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
2000-O-23 § 17)

persons filing returns under this section and the number of rooms covered in
said return, or from publishing or making available reasonable statistics
concerning the operation of the tax wherein the contents of returns are grouped
into aggregates in such a way that the information contained in any individual

3.32.010: PURPOSE OF ELECTRICITY AGGREGATION PROGRAM AND SERVICES:
This plan of operation and governance has been developed in compliance with 20
Illinois Compiled Statutes 3855/1-92 regarding governmental aggregation of
electric service. The statute defines two (2) types of aggregation programs
that may be enacted by a governmental entity: opt in aggregation and opt out
aggregation. The village of Beach Park ("village") will administer an opt out
aggregation program that will automatically include all eligible electric
accounts receiving a lower rate than the prevailing ComEd rate from an
alternative retail electric supplier ("supplier"). Those customers will be
given prior notice entitling them to affirmatively elect not to be part of the
program.
The village passed the necessary resolution to place the issue of opt out
governmental aggregation of electricity on the April 9, 2013, ballot. The
village will follow the plan of operation and governance ("plan") as outlined
below. This plan was adopted after two (2) public hearings were held in
accordance with 20 Illinois Compiled Statutes 3855/1-92.
The village's aggregation program ("program") seeks to aggregate the retail
electric loads of eligible customers located within the village to negotiate
the best rates for the generation supply of electric power. With a village
population of approximately thirteen thousand five hundred (13,500) the program
has the potential to combine residential accounts and small commercial accounts
into a buying group that will be attractive to an alternative retail electric
supplier ("supplier"). Participation in the program is voluntary. Any
individual customer ("member") has the opportunity to decline to be a member of
the program and return to the local utility (ComEd) standard offer of service
or to enter into a power supply contract with any alternative retail electric
supplier.
Residential and small commercial electric customers often lack the ability to
effectively negotiate electric supply services. The village's program provides
them an opportunity to benefit from professional representation and bargaining
power achieved through an aggregation program.
The program is designed to reduce the amount members pay for electric energy
and to gain other favorable terms of service. The village will not buy and
resell the power to the program members. Instead, the village will
competitively bid and negotiate a contract with a supplier to provide firm,
full requirements generation service to the members of the program. (Ord. 2013-
O-07)
3.32.020: BIDDING/CONTRACT PROCEDURES:
The village may elect to hold an individual bid or participate in a group bid
with other municipalities. The bidding process, whether by the village or in
concert with other municipalities, must be conducted in compliance with all
applicable village codes concerning the bidding process. The village reserves
the right to find other partners, to which to aggregate with. The village may,
but is not required to, retain the services of a consultant, broker, or other
expert in the field of electrical aggregation to assist in the preparation of
the bidding documents and in managing the bidding process. The village will
retain the full and absolute right to accept, accept with conditions, or reject
any bid. If this bidding process does not result in the identification of an
acceptable bidder, the village will conclude the bidding process and not
proceed with the aggregation program at this time.
By majority vote of the corporate authorities, the village may select an
alternative retail electric supplier to provide electric power to the program
according to the terms of a written power supply agreement entered into by and
between the supplier and the village. By majority vote of the corporate
authorities, the village may determine not to enter into a power supply
agreement with any supplier and in such event eligible customers shall continue
to purchase electric power through ComEd. If the corporate authorities enter
into a power supply agreement with a supplier, ComEd will continue to provide
and service delivery of the electricity purchased from the supplier, including,
but not limited to: metering, repairs and emergency service, as well as,
billing for these services, to be provided by ComEd.
The program may be terminated upon the termination or expiration of the power
supply agreement without any extension, renewal, or subsequent power supply
agreement being negotiated. Each individual member receiving electric supply
service under the program will receive notification forty five (45) to ninety
(90) days prior to termination of the program. In the event of termination,
members in the program would either return to ComEd supply service or choose
another supplier on their own. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.030: DETERMINATION OF RATES AND OTHER CHARGES:
   A.   Rates: The village will solicit bids from alternative retail electric
suppliers certified by the Illinois commerce commission to provide electricity
to aggregation programs. The bid documents shall require the suppliers to offer
a generation charge for firm, full requirements supply. The prices to be
charged to members in the program will be those of the supplier determined to
be the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. Members will be notified of the
rates and terms of the program through a direct mailing sent to each eligible
resident and business within the village limits.
   B.   Charges: Neither the village nor the selected supplier will impose any
terms, conditions, fees, or charges on any member served by the program unless
the particular term, condition, fee, or charge is clearly disclosed to the
member at the time the member chose not to opt out of the program.
ComEd will continue to bill for late payments, delivery charges and monthly
service fees, etc. These charges apply whether or not a member switches to the
program's supplier. Switching generation suppliers will not result in any new
charges billed to the member.
   C.   Switching Fees: Should ComEd assess a switching fee for members
voluntarily remaining in the aggregation program, the bid will be written to
require the selected supplier to pay the switching fee without assessing a fee
to the members.
   D.   Early Termination Fee: Members may terminate their agreement without
penalty if they relocate outside of the village. Members that leave the program
for other reasons may be assessed an early termination fee by the supplier. The
village will negotiate with the supplier to ensure that any early termination
fee assessed is reasonable and clearly stated in the opt out disclosure notice.
(Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.040: DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBLE CUSTOMER POOL:
Under the opt out aggregation provisions, all eligible electric consumers
within the village will be automatically included in the program. However, such
customers will be given prior notice entitling them to affirmatively elect not
to be part of the program.
Prior to mailing opt out notices, a thorough review will be performed to see
that all ineligible customers are excluded. The review process will include the
efforts of numerous parties and utilize a number of resources:
   A.   ComEd will query their customer database using best efforts to capture
all accounts within the village limits.
   B.   The supplier, with assistance from the village, using available village
resources and publicly available material shall screen out customers who are
not located within the village limits. Those resources may include any or all
of the following: property records, water and/or sewer records, fire and/or
police department address records, 911 address records, street listings,
village maps, internet maps, county parcel mapping databases, and geographical
information systems (GIS).
   C.   Ineligible accounts will be screened out based on codes provided in the
ComEd data.
   D.   The data shall be reviewed to see that all zip codes have been
included, all streets included, all customer classes, all customer rate
schedules, and finally that an expected total for a community of this
population was turned over.
   E.   Any suspected omissions will be reported to ComEd along with a request
to furnish that data. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.050: OPT OUT PROCESS:
The village is using an opt out form of governmental aggregation pursuant to 20
Illinois Compiled Statutes 3855/1-92. Any such person that opts out of the
aggregation program pursuant to stated procedure will default to the standard
service offer provided by ComEd until the person chooses an alternative
supplier.
When a successful supply offer is found the village shall order the eligible
customer list from ComEd. ComEd shall turn over the list to the village upon
request. Once the list is obtained, it will be shared with the selected
supplier and they will have thirty (30) days from the village's receipt of the
data to mail the opt out notices to all eligible members receiving an offer.
The selected supplier will be required to pay for printing and mailing of opt
out disclosure notices. The notices will be mailed to the owner or occupant
residing at the electric account mailing address shown on ComEd's customer
list. The selected supplier and the village will agree upon the format of the
opt out notice prior to mailing it to eligible members. A village official will
sign the notice and it will contain the village's name and logo on the outside
to clearly indicate to the recipient that it is a notice from the village.
Prior to mailing opt out notices, a thorough review will be performed to see
that all eligible members receiving an offer are sent the notice. The review
process will include the efforts of numerous parties and utilize a number of
resources as specified in section
3.32.040 of this chapter.
Following acceptance of an offer by the village, the supplier will mail opt out
notices to eligible members receiving an offer. Members will have at least
twenty one (21) days from the postmark date on the notice to postmark the
return opt out card if they do not wish to participate in the village's
program. The supplier may offer additional means of opting out, such as, a toll
free phone number, website, e-mail address, or fax number. The selected
supplier will not enroll those accounts opting out from the program.
In the event that an eligible member is inadvertently not sent an opt out
notice and is omitted from the program, the supplier shall, upon request,
enroll the eligible member at the group rate for the remaining term.
All members of the program will also be given an opportunity to opt out without
penalty at least once every three (3) years.
Procedure steps:
   A.   The selected supplier and the village will agree upon the format of the
opt out notice prior to mailing it to eligible members;
   B.   The selected supplier will distribute an opt out form to all eligible
members via first class U.S. mail;
   C.   Recipients will have at least twenty one (21) days from the postmark on
the notice to notify the selected supplier if they do not want to be part of
the program;
   D.   Members will be able to opt out by returning an opt out card via U.S.
mail to the selected supplier. The supplier may offer additional means of
opting out, such as a toll free phone number, website, e-mail address, or fax
number;
   E.   Additionally, members who do not opt out per subsection D of this
section will receive written notification from ComEd stating that they are
about to be switched. That notice will inform them that they have seven (7)
days to rescind the contract by contacting ComEd; and
   F.   The selected supplier will not enroll those accounts opting out from
the program.
The opt out notice will clearly notify the program members of the rates to be
charged for electricity and other terms of the contract with the selected
supplier. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.060: CUSTOMER CLASSES INCLUDED:
All eligible members are included in the program but the selected supplier's
bid will determine which groups receive an offer and opt out notice. It is
envisioned that most residential and small commercial customers supplied by
ComEd within the village limits are likely to receive an offer. The following
eligibility requirements apply:
   A.   Customers must not have opted out of the program.
   B.   Customers must not be supplied generation service from another
supplier.
   C.   Commercial customers must have a peak demand of less than or equal to
one hundred (100) kilowatts.
Customers receiving power from ComEd under particular tariffs as they may be
approved and/or amended by the Illinois commerce commission from time to time
may not be eligible to enroll in the aggregation program.
Utility rules approved by the Illinois commerce commission (ICC) or other
regulatory agencies may determine eligibility to enroll in the aggregation
program.
Eligibility may be limited by a supplier's offer. For example, a fixed rate
might not be offered to an account if they would not save when compared to the
prevailing ComEd rate. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.070: BILLING PROCEDURES:
The village will utilize the coordinated billing services of ComEd and the
selected supplier. Most customers are expected to receive a single bill from
ComEd that itemizes among other things, the cost of generation provided by the
supplier. In some instances, particularly for commercial accounts, the supplier
may request that dual billing be used. In this case the supplier would issue a
bill for their supply service and ComEd would issue a bill for their delivery
services. A single bill may also be issued by the supplier at the sole
discretion of the village.
Members are required to remit and comply with the payment terms of ComEd and/or
the supplier if dual billing or single billing by the supplier is used. This
program will not be responsible for late or no payment on the part of any of
its members. Furthermore, slow or no payment on the part of some members will
not adversely impact the rates charged to other members. The selected supplier
shall not charge more than one percent (1%) per month for overdue balances owed
the selected supplier. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.080: CREDIT/DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS:
Collection and credit procedures remain the responsibility of ComEd, the
selected supplier, and the individual member. Members are required to remit and
comply with the payment terms of ComEd and/or the supplier. This program will
not be responsible for late or no payment on the part of any of its members.
The village will have no separate credit or deposit policy. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.090: PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
Members have multiple means of addressing complaints. As a general rule,
concerns regarding service reliability should be directed to ComEd, billing
questions should be directed to ComEd or the selected supplier, and any
unresolved disputes should be directed to the ICC. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.100: MOVING INTO THE VILLAGE:
Residents and businesses that move into the village will not be automatically
included in the village's program. The village cannot guarantee the rates,
terms, and conditions to members enrolling after the twenty one (21) day opt
out period of the initial enrollees. Members wishing to opt into the program
may contact the supplier to obtain enrollment information. There is, however,
no guarantee that customers opting in at a later date will receive the same
price, terms, and conditions as did the initial participants. The selected
supplier's decision whether or not to extend an offer will be based, in part,
on the market prices at the time of request. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.110: MOVING WITHIN THE VILLAGE AND MAINTAINING THE SAME ACCOUNT NUMBER:
The selected supplier shall continue service at the same rate and under the
same terms and conditions for any member who relocates within the village prior
to the expiration of the contract term, providing that the member notifies the
supplier of their desire to do so with thirty (30) days' notice. Moving within
the village may cause the member to be served for a brief period of time by
ComEd. The supplier shall have the right to bill the participant for any
associated switching fee imposed by ComEd. Members may also opt out without
penalty under these circumstances. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.120: JOINING THE AGGREGATION GROUP AFTER OPTING OUT:
Members who have left the aggregation group and wish to rejoin at a later date
are treated in the same manner as new residents moving into the village. These
customers may contact the supplier at any time to obtain enrollment
information. There is, however, no guarantee that customers opting in at a
later date will receive the same price, terms and conditions as did the initial
participants. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.130: RELIABILITY OF POWER SUPPLY:
The program will only affect the generation source of power. ComEd will
continue to deliver power through their transmission and distribution systems.
Responsibility for maintaining system reliability continues to rest with ComEd.
If members have service reliability problems, they should contact ComEd for
repairs. The ICC has established "minimum reliability standards" for all
utilities operating distribution systems in Illinois. Customer outages,
duration of outages, interruptions, etc., are monitored to ensure reliability
remains at satisfactory levels.
In addition to maintaining the "wires" system, ComEd is required to be the
"provider of last resort". This means, should the selected supplier fail for
any reason to deliver any or all of the electricity needed to serve the
member's needs, ComEd will immediately provide for the shortfall. ComEd would
then bill the supplier for the power provided on their behalf. The members
would incur no additional cost. (Ord. 2013-O-07)
3.32.140: SUPPLIER QUALIFICATION SELECTION CRITERIA:
   A.   Only suppliers meeting strict criteria will be considered. Suppliers
will need to:
      1.   Be certified by the Illinois commerce commission.
      2.   Be registered with ComEd to do business in their service territory.
Both the certification and registration ensure that suppliers possess the
managerial, technical, and financial competence to perform the services they
offer.
      3.   Agree to hold harmless the village from any financial obligations
arising from the program.
      4.   Agree to notify the village and negotiate with the village at least
sixty (60) days in advance of attempting to terminate the agreement for any
reasons other than: a) the scheduled end date or b) force majeure.
      5.   Demonstrate its creditworthiness by possessing an investment grade
long term bond rating from at least two (2) major rating agencies.
   B.   Should the supplier be unable to demonstrate its creditworthiness, the
supplier will be required to provide:
      1.   A letter of credit; or
      2.   A parental guarantee from a company that is deemed creditworthy; or
      3.   A surety bond.
   C.   Details of the credit type and amount will be subject to negotiation.
   D.   Pursuant to 20 Illinois Compiled Statutes 3855/1-92, supplier shall:
      1.   Provide for universal access to all applicable residential customers
and equitable treatment of applicable residential customers.
      2.   Describe demand management and energy efficiency services to be
provided to each class of customers.
      3.   Meet any requirements established by law concerning aggregated

be made part of the record, the objector must provide the village clerk with
the objector's name and address.
   G.   Benchmark Analysis: If a cable operator submits its current basic cable

cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the
rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the internal

determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   B.   Expedited Determination And Public Hearing:
      1.   If the village board is able to expeditiously determine that the

village board shall:
         a.   Hold a public hearing at which interest persons may express their
views.
         b.   Act to approve the rate increase within thirty (30) days from the
date the cable operator filed its request with the village.

rates will go into effect.
   C.   Extended Review Period:
      1.   If the village board is unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost of service showing, the
village board shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:

that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and

a cost of service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the

portion of the increase.
   G.   Price Cap Analysis: If a cable operator presents its request for a rate
increase as being in compliance with the FCC price cap, the village board shall
review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard
form authorized by the FCC. Based on the village board findings, the basic
cable rates shall be established as follows:
      1.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      2.   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the village board shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   H.   Cost Of Service Showings: If a cable operator submits a cost of service
showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the
village board will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for cost
of service review. The village board may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost of
service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the
cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.

person requesting the village clerk to record the objection or may be submitted
in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.

exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost of service showing, and the village board
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      2.   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the village board's decision
resolution.
   K.   Appeal: The village board's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance

5.10.040: CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION:
   A.   Village May Require:
      1.   In those cases where the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the village
board may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to that
submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      2.   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the village board may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accordance with the
standard.
   B.   Request For Confidentiality:
      1.   A cable operator submitting information to the village board may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      2.   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      3.   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      4.   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
subsection, shall not be considered.
   C.   Village Board Action: Requests which comply with the requirements of
subsection B of this section, will be acted upon by the village board. The
village board will grant the request if the cable operator presents by a
preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with
applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be
placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public
inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the
village board denies the request, the village board shall take one of the
following actions:
      1.   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the village, the cable operator may request that the village
return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the village will
comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest
so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection.
      2.   If the information was required to be submitted by the village
board, the information will be made available for public inspection.
   D.   Appeal: If the village board denies the request for confidentiality,
the cable operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five
(5) working days of the village board's decision, and the release of the
information will stayed pending review. (Ord. 1994-O-16 § 4)
5.10.050: AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS:
   A.   Annual Inflation Adjustment: In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index.
   B.   Other External Costs:
      1.   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the
GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
state and local taxes applicable to the provisions of cable television service,
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      2.   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   C.   Notification And Review: The cable operator shall notify the village at
least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic
adjustment items. The village shall review the increase to determine whether
the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the village makes no
objection within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the increase, the
increase may go into effect. (Ord. 1994-O-16 § 5)
5.10.060: ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Refunds: The village may order the cable operator to refund to
subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following
circumstances:

Should the licensee fail to maintain a valid and current state issued
pawnbroker license or where the mayor has sufficient evidence demonstrating
probable cause to believe that the licensee has violated the provisions of this
code or the laws of the United States or the state of Illinois, and that said
violation will immediately threaten the public health, safety or welfare, the
mayor may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such
conclusion, and without prior notice or hearing, order the licensed premises
closed and the license summarily suspended pending a public hearing and
determination on suspension or revocation. Such hearing shall be commenced not
more than seven (7) days following entry of such an order, unless the licensee
shall agree to a longer period of time. The procedures for such a hearing or
any appeal with respect thereto shall be as otherwise provided in this chapter.
Upon entry of an order of summary suspension, the licensee shall be served with
a copy of the order and notice of violation and a hearing in the manner
provided by this chapter. (Ord. 2012-O-06)

Except as provided in section
5.35.240 of this chapter, prior to suspension or revocation of a license under
this chapter, the licensee shall be notified in writing of the nature of the
violation(s) and an opportunity for a hearing will be provided if a written
request for a hearing is filed with the finance director by the holder of the
license within ten (10) days. If a written request is filed within ten (10)
days, a hearing date shall be set within ten (10) days of receipt of the
request. If no written request for a hearing is filed within ten (10) days, the
suspension or revocation shall be sustained. (Ord. 2012-O-06)
5.35.260: HEARINGS:
As provided in this chapter, a hearing shall be conducted by the mayor or his
designee affording the licensee an opportunity to appear and defend the
charges. The finance director shall make a final decision in writing, including
the reasons for such decision, and shall serve such decision on the licensee
within ten (10) days after the conclusion of the hearing. The mayor shall
promulgate such rules of procedure for the hearing as the mayor deems
appropriate for the fair and efficient conduct of the hearing. The strict rules
of evidence followed by the trial courts of this state shall not be applicable
to the hearing. Discovery is not available in these proceedings as they are
administrative in nature. (Ord. 2012-O-06)
5.35.270: APPEALS:
Any person aggrieved by the action or decision of the mayor to deny, suspend or
revoke a license applied for or issued under the provisions of this chapter
shall have the right to appeal such action to the circuit court in accordance
with the administrative review law of the state of Illinois. (Ord. 2012-O-06)
5.35.280: PENALTY FOR VIOLATION:

during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this chapter is
committed, continued or permitted by any such person, and he shall be punished
accordingly. Each day, or portion thereof, that a violation exists constitutes
a distinct and separate offense under the terms of this chapter. The corporate
authority may take whatever action it deems appropriate to enforce the terms of
this chapter, including an action for injunction. All attorney fees and costs
incurred by the village in enforcing the terms of this chapter shall be paid by
the violator.
   C.   The levy and/or payment of any penalty or fine provided in this chapter
shall not be deemed a waiver of the authority of the village to suspend, revoke
or to refuse to renew a license or to seek injunctive relief to enjoin
violations of this chapter or other applicable provisions of law, the penalties
for violation hereof being deemed cumulative and not exclusive. (Ord. 2012-O-

valid and continued until the sooner of any of the following occurs:

certificate is transferred or conveyed so that fifty percent (50%) or more of

inspection of the property covered by the certificate if the village has
probable cause to believe that a violation of this section has or is taking

prevent the village from seeking a lawful administrative search warrant at any
time circumstances exist which would support the issuance of such a warrant.

exceed sixty (60) days from date of issue, may be granted when, in the
reasonable opinion of the code official, none of the violations, if known,
threaten life safety or health, and when the person(s) responsible for
correcting the violation(s) shall deposit with the code official, a cash bond
or a cashier's check payable to the village of Beach Park in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00). The cash bond or check shall be accompanied by a
letter from the new owner and occupant authorizing the code official after
sixty (60) days to enter the premises between the hours of eight o'clock (8:00)
A.M. and five o'clock (5:00) P.M. on any working day, or a convenient,
acceptable and reasonable time to the code official, for the purpose of
verifying compliance with respect to any outstanding violations. If the code
official determines the unit is fully compliant with the provisions of this
section a final certificate of compliance will be issued and the five hundred
dollar ($500.00) cash bond or cashier's check will be returned to the

with the provisions of this section, the temporary certificate of compliance
will be revoked, the unit must be vacated immediately, if occupied, and the

(36) months, determined at the time of original issuance and each subsequent
renewal. A thirty-six (36) month certificate is intended for properties with an
exemplary record of code compliance at inspections. A thirty-six (36) month
certificate does not exempt the unit from complaint based inspections. The
annual registration fee applies to all certificates. The determination of the
effective period will be made as follows:
      1.   A property that is in compliance with relevant property maintenance,
building and life safety codes at the time of the inspection shall be issued a
thirty-six (36) month certificate.
      2.   A property that has minor violations and no more than two major
(life safety) violations, all of which are corrected by the reinspection date
(30 days), shall be issued a thirty-six (36) month certificate.
      3.   A property that has three or more major life safety violations, or a
property with violations that have not been addressed by the reinspection date
(30 days) shall be issued a twelve (12) month license. (Ord. 2023-O-9)

5.36.060: INSPECTION PROGRAM:
   A.   Inspection Required. At the time of the receipt of a duly completed
initial application or renewal application and the required verification, and
the application fee having been paid, the code official, or his designee and
the applicant and tenant, shall schedule an inspection of the subject premises;
provided however, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the
code official from scheduling and/or lawfully seeking an inspection of any
dwelling unit where a certificate of compliance has expired and a renewal
certificate has not been issued or when the code official has reasonable belief
that a violation of the property maintenance code or other applicable building
or zoning codes have been violated.
   B.   The code official or his designee shall inspect all dwelling units
occupied, or held, or offered for letting or occupancy, or for which title is
to be transferred or conveyed within the village according to the schedule of
inspections established by the code official, unless a violation is reasonably
suspected, in which case the code official may make other and more frequent
inspections to seek compliance with the property maintenance code or other
applicable village codes and pursuant to any other applicable title of this
code.
   C.   The code official shall maintain a village-wide plan of all dwelling
units occupied or held or offered for occupancy which, to the code official's
best knowledge and belief, is based on the applications for certificate of
compliance, their renewal, or any other reasonable information available, and
establishing a schedule of inspections that will ensure that all such dwelling
units and associated premises shall be inspected at least once; provided,
however, upon probable cause that a violation exists, where required,
additional inspections may be made to take steps needed to bring the subject
building, dwelling unit and/or associated premises into compliance with the
property maintenance code and health and safety codes and ordinances.
   D.   Where the inspection is pursuant to an initial application or a renewal
application, the code official shall endeavor to schedule the inspection with
the applicant or the applicant's agent at a time and on a date during normal
village business hours, which is convenient to the code official and the
applicant or agent and the tenant, if any. In all other cases, the inspection
shall be made on a date and at a time which the code official may reasonably
and lawfully establish.
   E.   In the event the applicant, owner or tenant of the premises to be
inspected refuses entry to the premises to the code official or his designee,
or in the event the owner or his agent are uncooperative in scheduling the
inspection, the code official or his designee may seek the appropriate search
warrant from the circuit court of the 19th judicial circuit, Lake County,
Illinois, for an administrative inspection. There shall be no issuance of a
certificate, renewal certificate or temporary certificate until such inspection
has been made.
   F.   Inspection of the premises shall be conducted with the consent and
cooperation of the owner(s) or the designated agent and tenant. A consent may
be verbal from the tenant and owner or on a form provided by the village to be
signed and returned by the owner(s) or the designated agent and the tenant
prior to the inspection. The owner, applicant or tenant, as such parties may be
applicable, shall return the signed consent form to the village within fourteen
(14) calendar days of the village tender of a consent form, or at the time of
the scheduled inspection. Verbal consent will be indicated on the inspection
form and written consent will be attached to the report. Failure to return the
written consent form or provide verbal consent may result in the village
seeking an administrative search warrant from the 19th judicial circuit court
to enforce these regulations. In the event the village does not obtain an
administrative search warrant within ninety (90) days of failure to return
written consent form in the allowed fourteen (14) days of its tender, the
village may issue a temporary certificate of compliance until such
administrative search warrant is obtained. This issuance of temporary
certificate of compliance does not in any way imply that this property or
rental unit is in compliance with applicable codes and ordinances of the
village.
   G.   The inspections provided for in this section shall be of the
mechanical, sanitary, safety and structural components and characteristics of
the subject premises, including, but not limited to, interior and exterior
walls, walks and driveways, rooms, roofs and other areas open to plain view
from the ground or from the air, and all internal common areas, such as
vestibules, halls, stairways and basement areas, including furnace and other
utility areas and components, and all other areas within the structure which
pertain to each of the construction elements and room configurations of the
structure being inspected, or in which the owner has an equal right to
authorize entry. All sales contracts for real estate or other arrangements for
the transfer or conveyance of any dwelling unit, residential rental property
leases, licenses or the letting arrangements entered into or renewed after the
effective date of this section shall be subject to the provisions of this
section.
   H.   Each inspection shall be made by the code official or his designee and
shall be for the purpose for determining compliance with the provisions of this
section, the property maintenance code and health and safety regulations of the
village and all other applicable zoning, building and structural codes.
   I.   Any violations found as a result of the inspection shall be set forth
in a written notice to the owner(s) or owner's agent as designated on the
application form. A copy of such notice of violation may, but need not be, left
with the occupier or occupiers of the rental property. Notice of violations
shall be sent to the owner at the address stated on the application or to the
person designated on the application form as the owner's agent, within a
reasonable amount of time. In the absence of a person designated to receive
notice, the notice shall be sent by U.S. mail, postage prepaid, to the last
taxpayer of record shown on the records of the Lake County treasurer as
responsible for the ad valorem real estate taxes for the property in violation.
Such mailing is deemed to be service of such notice.
   J.   Reinspections shall be made as often as reasonably necessary to ensure
corrective action to cure any violations of the relevant ordinances or
regulations and to bring the building, dwelling unit and premises into
compliance. The inspections shall be scheduled with the village. The village
may schedule the inspections if owner or owner's agent or tenant is or are
unresponsive and if necessary, the appropriate administrative search warrant
may be sought for these purposes based upon probable cause or causes noted as
violations. The village at its discretion may accept photographs in lieu of an
inspection to document that minor violations have been addressed. (Ord. 2023-O-
9)

      1.   Any person, firm or entity violating the provisions of this section
shall be subject to a fine not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00)

question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine
that the property had become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite
of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the nuisance activity
leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. (Ord.

residents of the village, the village may apply to the court for such interim
relief. In such an event, the village need not comply with the notification
process set forth in section
8.12.330 of this article; however, the village shall make a diligent effort to
notify the person in charge prior to any emergency court hearing.
   B.   In the event the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property", as defined in section
8.12.310 of this article, the court may order the remedy set forth in section
8.12.350 of this article. Additionally, the court may assess a civil fine, as
provided in section

knowledge of the nuisance activities at the subject property and permitted the
nuisance activities to occur and/or continue.
   C.   The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy, in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event the village is authorized to secure the
property, all costs incurred by the village to effect a closure shall be
assessed as a lien against the property. As used herein, "costs" means those
expenses actually incurred by the village for physically securing the property.
   D.   The village shall prepare a statement of the costs and shall thereafter
submit said statement to the court for its review. If there is no objection to
the statement, the court may order that a lien in said amount may be recorded

the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 2000-O-22 §
1)
12.04.040: ROADWAY REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Frontage On Improved Roads: No subdivision plat shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on or can be provided
access to the following:
      1.   An existing major arterial, collector or local road.
      2.   A private road approved by the village board.
      3.   A road shown upon a plat previously approved and recorded in the
office of the county recorder.
   B.   Minimum Length Of Road Construction: The minimum length of road that is
required to be constructed where a temporary cul-de- sac has been approved
shall be one-half (1/2) of the minimum lot width as provided under the
applicable zoning standards.
   C.   Improvement Of Existing Adjacent Roads: Whenever land adjacent to an
existing road is subdivided and the existing road is not improved to a standard
as high as that required for the proposed subdivision road, the subdivider may
be required to improve the existing road if it is used for access to the
subdivision. Any improvement of an existing road shall be subject to the
approval of the public authority having jurisdiction, and if a village road is
involved, shall be improved according to the requirements of this section.
      1.   The building department shall not issue a building permit for any
proposed improvement unless said improvement has access to a "road" (as defined
herein).
      2.   Should a building permit be denied solely because of issues related
to road access or related improvements, exceptions may be permitted if approved
by the village board. The board may grant an exception to the above upon
positive findings that the applicant has met one or more of the following:
         a.   Applicant has developed a road program either solely or in
conjunction with other property owners to improve the road to a standard found
acceptable by the village based on recommendations of the village engineer;
         b.   Applicant provides the village with suitable assurance that the

improvements in conjunction with a financing mechanism such as recapture,
special service area, special assessments or other means found acceptable by
the village attorney and the village board;
         d.   Other means found acceptable by the village.
   D.   Improvement Of Access Road To Proposed Subdivision: Where a subdivision
does not front a road, and the access road does not lie within the subdivision,

contains an existing or proposed collector road or major arterial, all
requirements of the maintaining agency shall be met. In addition, access to
such collector road or major arterial shall be limited by one of the following
means:
      1.   All access to lots in the proposed subdivision shall be from local
roads within said subdivision.
      2.   Subdividing the lots so they will back onto the collector road or
major arterial and front onto a parallel local road. No access shall be
provided from said collector road or major arterial, and screening may be
required in a landscape buffer easement along the rear property line of such
lots.
      3.   A marginal access road may be built which is separated from the
collector road or major arterial by a planting or grass strip and provides
access thereto at suitable points.
      4.   The number of local roads entering a collector road or major
arterial shall be not more than one per quarter mile wherever possible.

   A.   Arrangement: The arrangement of roads shall provide for the
continuation of roads between and to adjacent properties when such continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire protection and
for the efficient provision of utilities. The rigid rectangular road pattern
need not necessarily be proposed. The use of curvilinear roads, cul- de-sac or
U-shaped roads shall be utilized where such will result in a more desirable
layout.
   B.   Topography: Roads shall be related appropriately to topography, soils
and drainage. They shall be arranged so as to obtain as many building sites as
possible at or above the grades of the roads. A combination of steep grades or
curves shall be avoided.

projected that the development will generate sufficient traffic, within the
first twelve (12) months of the development's completion to meet the traffic
warrants established by the traffic control manual. Channelization and lane
additions shall be provided by the subdivider when traffic signals are
required. These may also be required if the development will generate
sufficient traffic within the first twelve (12) months of the development's
completion to meet the warrants of the maintaining agency.
   G.   Responsibility Of Developers: If there is more than one development
being proposed, each developer shall be responsible for his/her proportionate
share of the costs of improvements. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.060: RIGHT OF WAY AND PAVEMENT WIDTHS:
   A.   Rights Of Way To Be Dedicated: Every right of way established for
subdivision or development purposes is to be separate and distinct from the
lots or parcels adjoining such right of way and not included within the
dimension or areas of such lot or parcels. All rights of way shall be dedicated
to the public by the subdivider.
   B.   Minimums: The minimum right of way widths for local roads shall be
sixty six feet (66'). Minimum pavement width for residential local roads shall
be twenty two feet (22'). Major arterial and collector roads shall have a right
of way width of one hundred twenty (120) to one hundred fifty feet (150') and
pavement width of thirty feet (30'). No dedication of right of way shall exceed

uniform width of the North Avenue right of way lying northerly of Yorkhouse
Road and lying southerly of Beach Road shall be a minimum of forty feet (40')
in width on each side of the centerline. Where new development requires access
to North Avenue at this location, then the village shall seek and receive
appropriate right of way dedication to comply with this provision. (Ord. 2000-
O-22 § 1)
12.04.070: PAVEMENT STRUCTURE:
Table 12.04.070, section
12.04.560 of this chapter, gives the minimum thickness for the pavement
structure in all developments. In all cases, topsoil shall be placed to the
edge of the bituminous surface or back of curb and seeded unless aggregate
shoulders are specified. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.080: CUL-DE-SAC:
   A.   General: A cul-de-sac shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead
end road. The length of such a road shall be measured from the centerline of
the road of origin to the centerline of the terminus. The center of the cul-de-
sac shall not be more than fifty feet (50') from the centerline of the cul- de-
sac road. Where circumstances warrant, a "T" turnaround may be approved by the
village.
   B.   Temporary Cul-De-Sac: A temporary cul-de-sac (standard or T) shall be
provided if requested by the village. The right of way lines shall be extended
to the boundary line of the proposed development if the adjacent property is
undeveloped. A notation shall be placed on the subdivision plat to the effect
that the temporary cul-de-sac shall be removed upon the extension of the road.

improvements required by the village. It shall maintain the same for the
periods specified by the village. Prior to the construction of any temporary
facility or improvement, the subdivider or developer shall file with the
village a separate suitable performance guarantee for temporary facilities. The
performance guarantee shall ensure that the temporary facilities shall be
properly constructed, maintained and removed. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.200: COMPLETION ASSURANCE; PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE:
   A.   General: A performance guarantee shall be provided in the form of a
cash bond, or irrevocable letter of credit. The village treasurer shall be and
is authorized to act for the village in all matters relating to the performance
guarantee unless otherwise provided for herein. The village may also require
restricted covenants as an additional performance guarantee where a cash bond,
or irrevocable letter of credit is posted, and is deemed inadequate to protect
the public interest. All reductions, releases and extensions of the performance
guarantee shall be recommended by the village engineer and shall be approved by
the village board.
      1.   Cash Bond: A cash bond may be posted by the subdivider in lieu of a
letter of credit provided for herein. The amount to be posted shall be equal to
one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the estimated cost of construction of the
improvements. This amount shall include the village costs of administering the
completion of improvements in the event the subdivider or developer defaults.
The cash bond shall be made payable to the village clerk prior to final action
on the plat or building permit. The type of cash bond provided may be a
cashiers check, bank draft, certified check or bank money order. A certificate
of deposit shall not be accepted. With the approval of the village engineer the
time of performance may be extended for not more than one year.
      2.   Irrevocable Letter Of Credit:
         a.   An irrevocable letter of credit will be acceptable; provided,
that the subdivider or developer obtains an approval of such letter of credit
from the village attorney; and provided, that the installation and construction
of the improvement is in strict conformance with the provisions of this chapter
within two (2) years from the date of final plat approval or issuance of the
building permit. All letters of credit shall be equal to one hundred thirty
percent (130%) of the estimated cost. This amount shall include the village
cost of administering the completion of improvements in the event the
subdivider defaults.
         b.   All letters of credit shall be posted for a period of two (2)
years from the date of final plat or building permit approval. However, when a
final plat is approved between and inclusive of December 1 and March 31, said
letter of credit shall be posted due to expire on April 1 following the two (2)
year period. The village engineer, for a good cause, with the approval of the
surety may extend the time of performance for not more than one year. Such
letters shall be submitted to the village clerk who shall provide a copy to the
village engineer.
   B.   Default: If the subdivider or permittee fails to perform the work with
sufficient workmen and equipment or with sufficient materials to ensure
completion of said work within the specified time, or performs the work
unsuitably, as determined by the village engineer, or neglects or refuses
materials or performs anew such work as shall be rejected as defective and
unsuitable or discontinues the execution of the work, or for any other cause
whatsoever does not carry on the work in any approved manner, the village
attorney shall give notice by registered mail to the subdivider or permittee
and his surety, of such delinquency, said notice to specify the corrective
measures required. After said notice, the village treasurer shall draft upon
the performance guarantee to have the work completed in accordance with the
terms of the performance guarantee. The village engineer may then take over the
work including any or all materials or equipment on the ground as may be
suitable and acceptable and may complete the work with his own forces or use
any such other materials as, in his opinion, shall be required for the
completion of the work in an acceptable manner. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.210: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE; REDUCTION, RELEASE OR EXTENSION:
No more than two (2) reductions in the performance guarantee shall be permitted
to any subdivider or permittee before the final release of the performance
guarantee. A fee shall be charged for a reduction in the amount of the
performance guarantee. The first reduction in the performance guarantee shall
not be permitted until such time as a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of the
required improvements have been completed. The second reduction in the
performance guarantee shall not be permitted until such time as a minimum of
seventy percent (70%) of the required improvements have been completed. All
requests for a reduction of the performance guarantee shall be in writing from
the subdivider or permittee and shall be accompanied by a letter from the
requestor's engineer stating the revised estimate of cost for the remainder of
all improvements. No performance guarantee shall be reduced below twenty five
percent (25%) of the principal amount. A request for renewal of a performance
guarantee which is approaching expiration shall be in writing from the
developer and submitted to the village engineer. Release of the performance
guarantee shall not be considered unless all required improvements have been
completed and a maintenance agreement is deposited with the village. The
reduction, release or extension of all performance guarantees shall be approved
by the village board. At the time of request for a release or reduction of a
performance guarantee, an inspection of the improvements of the subdivision
shall be made. The inspections shall be conducted by the village engineer and
any other affected agency. Any other official having jurisdiction shall also be
requested to be present. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.220: MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE:
   A.   Improvements: A maintenance guarantee shall be submitted by the
subdivider or permittee to the village engineer upon satisfactory completion of
all improvements and prior to the release of the original performance
guarantee. The term of the maintenance guarantee shall be for one, two (2) or
three (3) years following the completion of the improvements. All failures
which occur within the one, two (2) or three (3) year period shall be corrected
by the subdivider or developer and restored to satisfactory working condition,
subject to the approval of the village engineer. The term and amount of the
maintenance guarantee shall be determined by the village engineer. This
requirement may be waived if, upon review, a maintenance guarantee is deemed
unnecessary. Generally, the maintenance guarantee shall be in the amount equal
to ten percent (10%) of the original amount of the performance guarantee.
   B.   Default: If the subdivider or developer fails to restore to a
satisfactory condition the pavement or other improvements within the specified
time, or shall perform the work unsuitably as determined by the village
engineer, or for any other cause whatsoever, shall not carry on the restoration
in a suitable manner, the village attorney shall give notice by registered mail
to the subdivider or developer and his surety. Such notice shall specify the
corrective measures involved. If the subdivider or permittee, within a period
of ten (10) days after such notice, does not proceed in accordance therewith,
the village shall draft upon the surety in order to complete the restoration
work in accordance with the terms of the maintenance guarantee. (Ord. 2000-O-22
§ 1)
12.04.230: WAIVER OF SECURITY PROVISIONS:

the road right of way;
then the village board may waive the security provisions of sections
12.04.170 through
12.04.220 of this chapter and substitute therefor such reasonable restrictions
and conditions that it deems necessary for the safe and proper modification of
the existing roadway. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.240: ROAD VACATION; AUTHORITY TO VACATE:
Whenever the corporate authorities of the village determine that the public
interest will be served by vacating any road or alley, or part thereof, which
is under the jurisdiction of the village, such road or alley or part thereof
may be vacated as provided in this chapter. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.250: CHAPTER PROVISIONS NOT TO LIMIT AUTHORITY TO VACATE:
Nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way be deemed to limit the right
or authority of the village to vacate any plat or part thereof or any right of
way easement or part thereof. The village retains all powers and authority
granted to it under 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-91-1, as amended from
time to time. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)

stating the assessed valuation of all properties surrounding the plat or public
right of way to be vacated shall be furnished. Each party to a petition for
vacation of a plat, road or alley shall expressly agree, in that petition, to
pay to the village treasurer within thirty (30) days after the village board
grants any such vacation, his or her proportionate share of the total fees and
costs noted in the current fee schedule adopted by the village board, in
consideration of the conveyance of public property involved in the vacation. In
the case of the vacation of a plat that does not involve the conveyance of any
public property, no fee shall be charged.
   B.   The appropriate number of copies of a certified plat or applicable part
thereof bearing the certificate of a surveyor shall be furnished. The plat
shall show the portion to be vacated outlined or shaded so that it may be

(Ord. 2007-O-83 § 3)
12.04.290: VACATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   The village staff shall cause to be presented to the village board of
trustees the vacation request and staff's recommendation for approval, approval
in part, or denial of said vacation request. Staff's recommendation is to be
based on a summary of comments from the superintendent of public works,
engineer and a representative from building and zoning per the criteria
established in the Beach Park road vacation engineering study dated March 2005,
as prepared by RHMG Engineers, Inc. Prior to the recommendation being presented
to the village board of trustees, the petitioner(s) shall pay the petition
filing fee as provided in the fee schedule of the village, as amended.
   B.   The village board of trustees shall vote on the recommendation of
vacation. An affirmative vote of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the members of
the village board is required to grant a vacation.
   C.   Upon the affirmative vote of the village board of trustees to vacate
village property, the approved vacation will be conveyed by quitclaim deed of
vacation upon full payment to the village for the vacated property. Except in
special cases, as determined by the village board of trustees, payment for
vacated property shall be based on the "fair market" value of the property, as
determined in subsection D of this section. In village board of trustees
approved special cases, the village board may establish a vacation cost
different from the "fair market" value.
   D.   Except for the special cases noted in subsection C of this section, the
village board of trustees shall not grant a vacation of a public street until
and unless the petitioner(s) has tendered to the village the full fair market
value for the right of way real estate to be vacated. For purposes of this
section, "fair market value" means the average of assessed values of adjoining
properties, per acre, multiplied by the area of the street to be vacated
(expressed "per acre" and for fractions thereof), multiplied by a factor of
three (3) with the result divided by the number of adjoining property owners in
proportion to the frontage each property owner owns to the total vacated
parcel. The following example illustrates the method to be used to calculate
street vacation cost. It has been assumed that the vacation will be divided
amongst four (4) property owners. The same methodology would apply for more or
less adjoining property owners.
First half of right of way for owners 1 and 2.
Owner 1: Lot size 108' x 135' = 14,580 square feet
   Assessed value $6,401.00
Owner 2: Lot size 120' x 135' = 16,200 square feet
   Assessed value $7,106.00
   Value per square foot:
Owner 1: $6,401.00/14,580 = $0.44/square foot
   $0.44/square foot x 3 = $1.32/square foot
Owner 2: $7,106.00/16,200 = $0.44/square foot
   $0.44/square foot x 3 = $1.32/square foot
   Value of right of way:
   Right of way 60' wide x 135' long.
   60' x 135' = 8,100 square feet x $1.32/square foot = $10,692.00
Cost per linear foot:
   Adjoining properties: 108' + 120' = 228'
   $10,692.00/228' = $46.90/foot
Owners' cost:
   Owner 1: 108' x $46.90 = $5,065.00
   Owner 2: 120' x $46.90 = $5,628.00
The second half of the right of way would be calculated in the same manner for
owners 3 and 4. (Ord. 2014-O-36: Ord. 2012-O-20)
12.04.300: RECORDATION:
   A.   Following the village board of trustees' approval of the vacation, the
village clerk shall determine, from the recorder of deeds, the cost required to
record all documents and shall notify the petitioner and/or his attorney.
   B.   Upon receipt of the required fees, the hearing officer shall submit the
deed of vacation for signature of the village president, attested by the
village clerk.
   C.   Following execution of the deed of vacation, the village clerk shall
cause the signed deed of vacation, the originals of the petition, plat of
vacation and tax statement to be recorded with the recorder of deeds. (Ord.
2007-O-83 § 5)
12.04.310: INDEMNIFICATION:
The petitioner shall indemnify and hold harmless the village for damages
resulting to any person as a result of such vacation. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.320: PUBLIC UTILITY RIGHTS:
The vacation of any plat or part thereof or a right of way easement or a part
thereof shall not be deemed to be a vacation of the rights of any public
utility where such public utility has installed or has plans to install its
facilities therein. In all vacated roads, alleys or parts thereof, there shall
remain a utility easement, whether present or not. However, the petitioner
always has the right to request to the village board of trustees that the
vacated property be released from the required utility easement. (Ord. 2007-O-
83 § 6)
12.04.330: RESERVED:
(Ord. 2007-O-83 § 6)

generated by any proposed development along the roadway to be connected to the
village road).
   D.   An irrevocable letter of credit in the name of the village in an amount
equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the estimated costs
(estimated by the village engineer) of completion of the work on the village
right of way and ditch lines. Such security shall be posted for a minimum of
one year, but may be reduced by the village as work progresses.
   E.   A maintenance bond in an amount sufficient to adequately guarantee the
work on the public right of way within the village for a period of one year
from date of completion of the work. Prior to issuance of the permit, such
completion date shall be determined and used for purposes of the duration of
the bond. The village engineer shall determine the reasonable amount of the
bond in light of the nature and extent of the work performed.
   F.   The name and address and telephone number of the applicant and the
person or firm performing or to perform the work (if known). (Ord. 2000-O-22 §
1)
12.04.360: PROMULGATION OF RULES AND REGULATIONS:
The public works committee of the village board may promulgate such other
reasonable rules and regulations pertaining to such permits in order to guide
the village in reviewing such applications so as to prevent:
   A.   Excessive additional traffic and noise on neighborhood streets which
are not designed for the additional traffic to be generated by the proposed
connections.
   B.   Hazards to health, safety and welfare of the citizens on and along the
connecting roadways.
   C.   Lessening of property values of those properties along the local
roadways within the village.
   D.   A disturbance of the neighborhood character along the local roadways
within the village. (Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.370: EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as the granting of a right in any
person or firm to connect a roadway to a roadway under the exclusive
jurisdiction of the village. The village board, in its sole discretion, shall
determine the granting or denial of a permit. No permit shall be issued to a
person who has failed to pay any fine, penalty or debt owing to the Village
(“Village Debt”). A person whose permit application is rejected based on a
Village Debt may appeal the decision, which appeal must be in writing and filed
with the Village Clerk within ten (10) days following the decision. The written
appeal must include the basis for contesting the Village Debt and other
information that will help the applicant’s case. Within the body of the written
appeal, the Applicant may also request a hearing to contest the Village Debt.
The Village Administrator will set a hearing date within ten (10) days of the
receipt of the written request for hearing and will rule on any appeals that
are timely filed. If a timely written appeal is not filed, the Village Debt
will be considered final. (Ord. 2019-O-24 § 11: Ord. 2000-O-22 § 1)
12.04.380: APPLICATION FEE:
All applications and data submitted therewith shall include a nonrefundable

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights of way and the village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased storm water runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights of way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   E.   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   F.   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)

be accompanied by a fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). In the event a
utility company has obtained a village permit pursuant to this chapter, the fee
will be waived. (Ord. 2008-O-38 § 1: Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.050: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
   A.   Village Review Of Permit Applications: Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the engineer or
superintendent within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does
not conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the engineer or superintendent shall reject such application
in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the engineer or superintendent is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the
superintendent shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the engineer or superintendent, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   B.   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications
Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the telephone company act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the village not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The engineer or
superintendent shall specify the portion of the right of way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event the engineer or superintendent fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter, although in all other appropriate respects, the
telecommunications retailer shall be bound by the provisions of this chapter.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to section
13.02.040 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection A of this
section.
   C.   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Holders Of State
Authorization Under The Cable And Video Competition Law Of 2007: Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state issued authorization under the cable
and video competition law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days
after submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village,
provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
   D.   No permit shall be issued to a person who has failed to pay any fine,
penalty or debt owing to the Village (“Village Debt”). A person whose permit
application is rejected based on a Village Debt may appeal the decision, which
appeal must be in writing and filed with the Village Clerk within ten (10) days
following the decision. The written appeal must include the basis for
contesting the Village Debt and other information that will help the
applicant’s case. Within the body of the written appeal, the Applicant may also
request a hearing to contest the Village Debt. The Village Administrator will
set a hearing date within ten (10) days of the receipt of the written request
for hearing and will rule on any appeals that are timely filed. If a timely
written appeal is not filed, the Village Debt will be considered final. (Ord.
2019-O-24 § 13: Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.060: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights of way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
   B.   Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: At the election of the village, no
construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior
to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who
will perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The
preconstruction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by
the village with such village representatives in attendance as the village
deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work
under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas
where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of
other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid
disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a village permit
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. (Ord.
2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.070: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section
13.02.210 of this chapter. If the village denies the request, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.080: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license or similar agreement, each utility occupying right of way or
constructing any facility in the right of way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed below:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C" and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
required policies to the village within ten (10) days following receipt of a
written request from the village.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
         It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt
by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested,
of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel
or not to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting
the requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private
self-insurer" under the workers' compensation act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state of Illinois.
(All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.) (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.090: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.100: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the engineer or superintendent, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the engineer or
superintendent may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2008-O-16 §
3)
13.02.110: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:
   A.   Village Right To Revoke Permit: The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      1.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      2.   Noncompliance with this chapter;
      3.   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      4.   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   B.   Notice Of Revocation Or Suspension: The village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this section.

Suspension: Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      1.   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      2.   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      3.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights of way and restore the rights of way
to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such removal to
the village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this subsection.
   D.   Stop Work Order: In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within this section.
   E.   Failure Or Refusal Of The Permittee To Comply: If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of this section, the village or its designee may,
at the option of the village: 1) correct the deficiencies; 2) upon not less
than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities
or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days' notice to the
permittee of failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the village. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the
village for all costs of removal. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)

and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right of way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village's right
of way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 2008-O-16
§ 3)

to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No Interference With Village Facilities: No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the engineer or superintendent determines that the
proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
      2.   Minimum Interference And Impact: The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right of way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right of
way.
      3.   No Interference With Travel: No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right of way.
      4.   No Limitations On Visibility: No utility facility shall be placed in

practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right of way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right of way line and any above
grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right of way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts, Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.
      4.   Overhead Power Or Communication Facility: An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:

         b.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      6.   Markers: The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right of way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
   D.   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights Of Way: The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights of way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   E.   Freestanding Facilities:
      1.   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right of way.
      2.   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right of way to be screened from view in a manner appropriate for the
surrounding environment, and the village may require the facility's owner to
maintain such screening.
   F.   Facilities Installed Aboveground: Aboveground facilities may be
installed only if:
      1.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      2.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in

foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right of way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.

electric utility shall conduct all tree trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right of way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   B.   Other Utilities; Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right of way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   D.   Chemical Use:

village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights of way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village initiated or mandated improvement in or upon, or the operations
of the village in or upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights of way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
police department shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the village a

as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision
of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a
variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The engineer or superintendent shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The engineer or superintendent may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are not
practical in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the engineer or superintendent may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the engineer
or superintendent under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The village
board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.220: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 2008-O-16 § 3)
13.02.230: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, properties which are
subject to special assessment no. 1 as finally confirmed by order of the
Circuit Court of Lake County, entered January 4, 1995 (hereinafter called
"assessed property"), in case number 3 TX 2, shall not pay the connection
charges provided that the connection is made prior to May 1, 2018. Effective
May 1, 2018, the properties in SAA 1 not connected to the Village's water
system will be subject to the connection fee as well as all the other
applicable fees designated in the fee schedule. (Ord. 2017-O-9)
13.04.130: "OWNED AND IMPROVED AS ONE PARCEL"; DIVISION OR TRANSFER:
A connection fee shall be charged in accordance with the applicable fee as
provided in the fee schedule of the Village, as amended, if property identified
on the assessment roll as "owned and improved as one parcel" is either divided,
conveyed or transferred so that one or more of such conveyed parcels will
result in parcels no longer being owned and improved as one parcel. In this
event, the resulting parcel(s) shall be subject to the applicable connection
fee as provided in the fee schedule of the Village, as amended, if such
resulting parcel(s) show no assessment in the assessment roll, but for the
"owned and improved as one parcel" designation in such roll. An example for
application of this section is as follows:
Example: "A" owns two (2) contiguous lots called Lot 1 and Lot 2. A's single-
family residence is on Lot 1. Lot 2 is vacant and is an extension of A's side
yard. The assessment roll discloses that Lots 1 and 2 are "owned and improved
as one parcel" and assesses Lot 1 in the amount of four thousand two hundred
dollars ($4,200.00) and Lot 2 as "0". "A" sells Lot 2 to "B" who intends to
build a house on Lot 2.
Situation 1. If "B" pays the four thousand two hundred dollars ($4,200.00)
assessment for "A" on Lot 1, "A" will be subject to a connection fee if "A"
connects to the water system, and "B" will be credited for payment of the
connection charge. When "B" connects to the water system for Lot 2, no
connection fee will be due from "B"; or
Situation 2. If "B" does not pay the full assessment for Lot 1, then when "B"
connects to the water system for Lot 2, "B" will pay the connection fee.
In situation number 1 above, "B" will be shown on the Village records as having
prepaid the connection fee for Lot 2, and the assessment shall remain on Lot 1
owned by "A". (Ord. 2015-O-4)
13.04.140: WATER CONNECTION APPLICATIONS AND PERMITS:
   A.   It is unlawful for anyone to connect to or cause a connection to the

using suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by the customary
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite sample
or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always,
BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24 hour composite samples,
whereas pHs are determined from period grab samples.)
   H.   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing
any special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
permitted by the village for treatment subject to payment therefor by the

as a source of potable water. Building sewers located within fifty feet (50')
of a well must be constructed of cast iron soil pipe with leaded or mechanical
joints or transite pipe with compression joints, either of which must meet ASTM
standards for water main construction.
   L.   If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be
of cast iron soil pipe; except, that nonmetallic material may be accepted if
laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the inspector.
   M.   The size and slope of the building sewers shall be subject to the
approval of the village, but in no event shall the diameter be less than six
inches (6"), except for cast iron soil pipe which may be four inches (4"). The
slope of such pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch (1/8") per foot.
   N.   No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet (3')
of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be
sufficient to afford protection from the frost. The building sewer shall be
laid at a uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes
in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings.
   O.   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewerage carried by such drains
shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building
sewer. No water operated sewage ejector shall be used.
   P.   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall
be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the inspector. Pipe laying and
backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specifications; except,
that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by the
inspector.
   Q.   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight and
rootproof. Leaded cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or
hemp and filled with molten lead, federal specifications QQ-L-156, not less
than one inch (1") deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight. No
paint, varnish, or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material
until after the joint has been tested and approved. All joints between
vitrified clay pipe and cast iron pipe shall be made by packing a closely
twisted jute or oakum gasket, of suitable size, to fill partly the annular
space between the pipes. The remaining space shall be filled and firmly
compacted with mortar, and the entire connection shall be encased in concrete.
Approved reducing adapters will be used. Only joints and seals for concrete,
cement or clay pipe, such as "O" ring and "M" ring or equal shall be approved
by the inspector.
   R.   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If
the public sewer is twelve inches (12") or less in diameter, and no properly
located "Y" branch is available, a neat round hole may be cored in the public
sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at
an angle of about forty five degrees (45°). A forty five degree (45°) elbow may
be used to make such a connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend
past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at
the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the
invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the
connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special
fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the inspector.
   S.   A granular bedding (sand or gravel) for the building sewer shall be
used to a minimum depth of four inches (4") under the pipe when required by the
inspector. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the village
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall be made only under the direction and supervision of
the inspector.
   T.   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village.
   U.   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, footing drains, or
other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building
drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer. (Ord. 2015-O-5)
13.08.080: PERMITS AND FEES:
   A.   Application For Permit; Sanitary District Approval Required: Prior
approval of the North Shore sanitary district, evidenced by a signed permit
from the North Shore sanitary district or the county public works, whichever is
applicable, must be obtained before an application for a building sewer permit
is filed with the village. The owner or his agent shall make application on a
special form furnished by the village. The permit application shall be
supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered
pertinent in the judgment of the village.
   B.   Reason For Fees: For all connections to the village sewerage system,
and except as limited or modified by special rules or regulations applicable to
various properties, the applicable standard sewer connection and permit fees
hereinafter provided for are to provide a reasonable contribution toward that
proportionate part of the overall cost of installing, operating, maintaining,
repairing, replacing and expanding the village sewerage system. The special
rules or regulations applicable to the various properties limiting or modifying
the fees may include, but are not limited to, those pertaining to special
service areas, other special connection fees, recapture fees, required
extensions or special agreement.
   C.   Connection And Inspection Fees: Subject to such applicable exceptions
and/or qualifications, the established connection and inspection fees are as
provided in the fee schedule of the village, as amended:

amended. Similarly, for each sanitary sewer connection made to the village
sewer system from a commercial or industrial building, or other nonresidential
structure, the basic connection charge hereunder shall be determined on a
population equivalent (PE) basis of sewer use for each facility connected,
using one hundred (100) gallons per PE per day as the criteria and based upon a
charge per PE and as set forth in the sanitary sewer connection fee as provided
in the fee schedule of the village, as amended.
   F.   Permit To Connect To Interceptor Or Trunk Line: In the event that it
becomes necessary for a new user to connect directly to any county or North
Shore sanitary district interceptor or trunk line located or constructed within
the limits of the village, a permit shall be obtained from the North Shore
sanitary district and an inspection fee, as provided in the fee schedule of the
village, as amended, shall be payable to the village for each village
inspection of the connection.

estate tax bill for the subject premises. The failure of the village to record
the lien, or to mail the notice of delinquency or lien to the owner of the
subject premises, or the failure of the owner to receive such notice, shall not
affect the right of the village to foreclose the lien or otherwise collect the
amounts then due to the fullest extent authorized by law. The remedies
available to the village, whether in foreclosure, collection or otherwise,
shall be cumulative and not exclusive.
         a.   In addition to the rates and charges stated above, whenever the

the bill for village system service has remained unpaid thirty (30) days after
it has been rendered, is greater than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and the
service has been terminated.
   C.   Whenever a bill for village system service remains unpaid thirty (30)
days after it is due, the person whose name appears on the bill shall be found
in violation of an offense against the village. Each such person is guilty of a
separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any
violation of any provision of the ordinances of the village is committed,
continued or permitted by any such person, and such person is punishable
accordingly. Each person shall be subject to a fine of not less than fifty
dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each
offense plus any and all costs involved to prosecute, terminate service or to
collect on unpaid balances. (Ord. 2015-O-5)

of the special service areas for each municipal utility the revenues from which
secure, in whole or in part, the debt service on such bonds, and to then divide
the result by the number of parcels established on the special tax roll for
each of the special service areas in order to reach a "per zoning lot" or "per
parcel" payoff amount.
      3.   The budget officer shall file with the village clerk the annual
calculation of the payoff amount along with a list of the respective lots or
parcels and their permanent index numbers (PINs) as such lots, parcels and PINs
may appear on the special tax roll for each special service area.

subsection B of this section.
      3.   In the event the property to be connected is to be or is used for
other than single-family home purposes, the special connection charge shall be
determined by multiplying the payoff amount by the number of zoning lot
"single-family home equivalents" for such typical sewer use. (Ord. 2015-O-5)

13.12.070: DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS:
   A.   Prohibition Of Illegal Discharges: No person shall throw, drain or
otherwise discharge, cause or allow others under its control to throw, drain or
otherwise discharge into the MS4 any materials, pollutants or waters containing
any pollutants, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm water drainage system is
prohibited except as described as follows:
      1.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing, landscape irrigation,
diverted stream flows, rising ground water, uncontaminated ground water
infiltration, uncontaminated pumped ground water, discharges from potable water
sources, foundation drains, air conditioning condensation, irrigation water,

      2.   Discharges or flow from firefighting, and other discharges specified
in writing by the AEA as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      3.   Discharges associated with dye testing; however, this activity
requires a verbal notification to the AEA prior to the time of the test.
The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstorm water discharge permitted under
an NPDES permit, waiver or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and
administered under the authority of the USEPA, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver or order and all
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for the discharge to the storm water drainage system.
   B.   Prohibition Of Illicit Connections: The construction, use, maintenance
or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm water drainage
system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation,
illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      1.   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage or any other nonstorm water discharge
to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
      2.   Improper connections in violation of this chapter must be
disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved on site wastewater
management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the AEA.
      3.   Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps
or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system shall be
located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written
notice of violation from the AEA requiring that such locating be completed.
Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of
the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be
identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall
location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer
system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations
are to be documented and provided to the AEA. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.080: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain, as practicable, that part of the
watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and
other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall
maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a
watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function or physical integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.090: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
   A.   Any person subject to an NPDES construction site activities permit or
NPDES industrial activities permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with an NPDES construction site activities permit
or NPDES industrial activities permit may be required, in a form acceptable to
the AEA, prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
   B.   The operator of a facility, including construction sites, required to
have an NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial
activity shall submit a copy of the NOI to the AEA at the same time the
operator submits the original NOI to the EPA as applicable.
   C.   The copy of the NOI to discharge storm water may be delivered to the
AEA either in person or by mailing it to:
      Notice of Intent to Discharge Stormwater
      Village of Beach Park
      11270 W. Wadsworth Road
      Beach Park, IL 60099
   D.   A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is
discharging storm water associated with industrial activity without having
submitted a copy of the NOI to do so to the AEA. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.100: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   A.   Right Of Entry; Inspection And Sampling: The AEA shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often
as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.
      1.   If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
AEA.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the AEA ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, examination and copying
of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      3.   The AEA shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility
such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the AEA to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.
      4.   The AEA has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      5.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the AEA and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the AEA access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the AEA reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   B.   Search Warrants: If the AEA has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the AEA may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.110: REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BMPs:
Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of
a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of an SWMP as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2008-O-27
§ 1)
13.12.120: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or any person responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation, has information regarding any known or suspected
release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
in pollutants entering storm water, the storm water drainage system or waters
of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the AEA
in person, by phone or by facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village within two (2) business days of the phone
call or personal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least five (5) years. Failure to provide notification of a release of
hazardous materials is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.130: VIOLATIONS, ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES:
   A.   Violations: It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. Any
person who has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter
may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be
restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. In
the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or
public safety, the AEA is authorized to enter upon the subject private
property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary
to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The AEA is authorized to
seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section
13.12.170 of this chapter.
   B.   Warning Notice: When the AEA finds that any person has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued
hereunder, the AEA may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease.
Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this
subsection shall limit the authority of the AEA to take any action, including
emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
warning notice.
   C.   Notice Of Violation:
      1.   Whenever the AEA finds that a person has violated a prohibition or
failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the AEA may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person. The notice of violation
shall contain:
         a.   The name and address of the alleged violator;
         b.   The address, when available, or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
         c.   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
         d.   A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
         e.   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
         f.   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed
to the AEA by filing a written notice of appeal within ten (10) days of service
of the violation; and
         g.   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore
compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and such expense shall be
charged to the violator.
      2.   Such notice may require, without limitation:
         a.   The performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;
         b.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
         c.   That violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease
and desist;
         d.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
         e.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
         f.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   D.   Compensatory Action: In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and
remedies authorized by this chapter, the AEA may impose upon a violator
alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at
compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   E.   Emergency Cease And Desist Orders: When the AEA finds that any person
has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, or any
order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to
recur, and that the person's violation(s) has/have caused or contributed to an
actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or water of the United States which
reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the AEA may issue an order
to the violator directing it to immediately cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all the requirements of this chapter and any
other applicable laws or regulations; and
      2.   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this section
shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event a discharger fails to immediately voluntarily comply with the
emergency order, the AEA may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to
persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of the
facility's water supply, sewer connection or other municipal utility services.
The AEA may allow the person to resume its discharge when it has been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the AEA that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless further terminated proceedings are initiated against the
discharge pursuant to this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or
in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement describing the cause of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the AEA within thirty
(30) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency cease and
desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the violator. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.140: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The AEA
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to
the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4 or to waters of the United States.
If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the AEA may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage
to the MS4 or waters of the United States and to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
AEA will notify a violator, in writing, of the proposed termination of its MS4
access. The violator may petition the AEA for a reconsideration and hearing.
   C.   Violation: A person is in violation of this chapter if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without
the prior written approval of the AEA. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.150: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
AEA. The notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) days from the date
of the notice of violation. The notice of appeal shall clearly and specifically
state what portion or portions of the decision the appellant is appealing from.
Failure to appeal with the required written specificity shall be deemed a
waiver of those portions of the decision not specified.
The strict rules of evidence in effect in the circuit court shall not apply to
the hearing. Hearing on the appeal before a hearing officer of the AEA, or
other designated administrative body, shall take place within twenty (20) days
from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the
designated hearing officer shall be final from and after its issuance and the
mailing or delivering a copy thereof to the appellant. An appeal hereunder or
pursuant to the administrative review act shall not toll the effects of a
continuing violation under the penalties provided herein. An appeal to the AEA,
to be heard by the village, shall stay the enforcement of the order and penalty
provided for in this chapter. An appeal pursuant to the administrative review
act shall not stay the enforcement of any order and penalty provided herein.
(Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.160: ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five (5) days
of the decision of the designated hearing officer, then the AEA reserves the
right to enter upon the subject private property and take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the AEA or designee to enter upon the premises for the
purposes set forth above.
The AEA may extend the period for corrective action upon a showing of good
cause for extension of the corrective action period. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.170: COST OF ABATING THE VIOLATION:
Within ten (10) days after abatement of the violation by the AEA, the owner of
the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including, but not
limited to, administrative, court, attorney and engineering costs. The property
owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment
within ten (10) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as
determined by the decision of the designated management agency or by the
expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a
special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable
to the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not
more than twelve (12) equal monthly payments. Interest at the rate of prime
plus two percent (2%) per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on
the first day following discovery of the violation. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.180: VIOLATIONS DEEMED A PUBLIC NUISANCE:
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter is a threat to public health, safety and welfare, and is declared and
deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin or otherwise compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken. (Ord. 2008-O-27 § 1)
13.12.190: REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE:
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the

   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30)
days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial
shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees,
and recommencement of the Village's review period.
   The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted
with the revised application.
   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies

      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice
of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar

      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village
may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.

collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance
with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
   The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Pole Zones: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable
codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in the Village of Beach Park Zoning Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee for an application to
collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or
wireless support structure, and for each small wireless facility addressed in a
consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on

   B.   Issuance and Effect of Stop Work Order. The building official, or his
or her authorized designee, may issue a stop work order either orally or in
writing. If the stop work order is first issued orally, then it must be
followed with a written stop work order within 48 hours after such oral order.
After a stop work order has been issued, whether orally or in writing, all work
or action subject to such order must be stopped immediately. The stop work
order may be given to the permittee, to his or her agent, or to the person
doing the work. A copy of the stop work order will be posted on the premises.
   C.   Unlawful Continuance. It is unlawful for any person to do any work or
to take any action in violation of a stop work order. Any person, other than
the building official or his or her authorized designee, who removes a posted
stop work order or who continues any work in or about the building, structure,
or premises after a stop work order has been issued and posted, is guilty of a
violation of this section and is subject to prosecution and fines as provided
in this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the
permittee, after approval of the building official, may do such work as is
necessary to protect the public health and safety and to correct the safety
hazards, code violations, or other defects complained of in the stop work

been issued, that such other action has been taken or is forthcoming to resolve
the original complaints, and that proper cash bonds or other guarantees have
been filed with the Village. After payment of any required fees or fines,
written release of the stop work order will be given to all parties who had
previously received the original stop work order. The stop work order then will
be removed by the building official and the work may proceed. (Ord. 2023-O-8)
15.01.130: CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY:
   A.   Permission. The building official, at his or her discretion and only
after a specific request from the permittee, may give permission to the owner
or his designee to place inventory, fixtures, racking, material, stock, other
types of inventory, or the like in a business, office, or industrial building.
This permission may be granted only if the placement of the materials will not
limit the completion of construction or inspections and provided the fire
suppression and alarm systems have been installed, tested, and accepted by the
Village fire department for granting of such permission. This permission does
not allow occupation of the building or area to conduct business of any kind
under any circumstances.
   B.   Fees. A fee shall be charged for each original certificate and copy
thereof as provided in the Village’s Schedule of Fees. If a new Certificate of

Subsection
15.01.190 of this chapter, Subsection
8.12.200(B) of this code and 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-20-7. Upon
failure to comply with the notice of violation, any duly authorized employee of
the Village or contractor hired by the Village shall be authorized to enter
upon the property in violation and cut and destroy the weeds growing thereon,
and the costs of such removal shall be paid by the owner or agent responsible
for the property.
   A.   Definition; Removal Required. Any structure or premises that is, or
hereafter becomes, unsanitary, deficient in exit facilities, a fire hazard,
deficient in structural stability; or an attractive nuisance, or that is
otherwise dangerous to human life, safety, or the public welfare (such
conditions hereinafter collectively referred to as unsafe) is deemed an unsafe
structure or premises. Every unsafe structure must be taken down and removed,
in whole or in part, or made safe and secure, as the building official deems
necessary or as provided in this title. A vacant structure with unguarded or
open doors, windows, or other openings and accessible to the general public and
animal intrusion is an attractive nuisance, a fire hazard, and unsafe within
the meaning of this section.
   B.   Examination of Unsafe Structures and Premises. The building official
will examine every structure and premises reported as unsafe and will prepare a
report of his or her findings.
   C.   Notice of Unsafe Conditions. If an unsafe condition is found in a
structure or premises, then the building official will serve written notice on
the owner, the owner’s agent, or the person in control of the structure or
premises, describing the unsafe conditions found and specifying the required
repairs, improvements, or actions to be taken to render the structure or
premises safe or secured, or requiring the unsafe structure or portion thereof
to be demolished, or such other action as is necessary to remove the hazard
within a stipulated time. Such notice must require the person thus notified to
declare, to the building official, his or her acceptance or rejection of the
terms of the notice.
   D.   Restoration Of Unsafe Structure. An unsafe structure may be restored to
a safe condition. If the cost of the repairs or reconstruction necessary to put
the structure into a safe condition is estimated by the building official to
exceed 50% of the fair market value of the structure in its un-restored
condition, then the structure must be made to comply in all respects with the
provisions of this title, the Beach Park Zoning Regulations, and all other
applicable codes and ordinances for the construction of a new structure,
including without limitation the installation of fire and life safety systems
required pursuant to this title.
   E.   Posting Unsafe Notice. If the owner, owner’s agent, or person in
control of the unsafe structure or premises cannot be found, then the notice of
unsafe condition will be sent by registered or certified mail to the last known
address of one of those persons and a copy of such notice will be posted in a
conspicuous place on the structure or premises.
   F.   Disregard Of Unsafe Notice. After refusal or neglect of the person
served with a notice of unsafe condition to comply with the requirements of the
notice to abate the unsafe condition, the Village may institute the appropriate
legal action to compel compliance with the order. (Ord. 2023-O-8)
15.01.150: EMERGENCY MEASURES:
   A.   Vacating Structures. When, in the opinion of the building official or
fire official, there is an immediate danger of failure or collapse of a
structure or any part thereof that would endanger life, or when any building or
structure has collapsed and life is endangered by the continued occupation of
the structure, the building official may order and require the occupants
thereof to vacate the structure forthwith. In that case, the building official
will cause to be posted, at each entrance to such structure, a notice reading
DANGER and stating that the structure is unsafe and its use or occupancy has
been prohibited. It is unlawful thereafter for any person to enter such
structure except for the purpose of making required repairs or demolishing the
structure.
   B.   Temporary Safeguards. When, in the opinion of the building official or
fire official, there is an immediate danger to life, property, or the safety of
the general public by a collapse or failure of a structure or by other unsafe
conditions on or in the structure or premises, the building official
immediately may cause the necessary work to be done to render such structure or
premises or parts thereof temporarily safe or inaccessible to the general
public.
   C.   Closing of Streets and Buildings. When necessary for public safety, the

title; or
   C.   In violation of any applicable ordinance, statute, or law of the
Village or any other agency having legal jurisdiction over the performance of
the work being done.
The notice of violation, or order to comply, will direct the discontinuance of
the illegal action or condition and the abatement of the violations, and will
provide a time period for discontinuance or abatement which is appropriate for
the condition. (Ord. 2023-O-8)
15.01.190: PROSECUTION OF VIOLATIONS:
If a notice of violation or order to comply is not complied with promptly, then
the building official will issue a stop work order as provided for in Section

correct violations, whether related to a formal stop work order or other
official notice of the Village, then the Village will institute the appropriate
proceedings at law or in equity to restrain, correct, or abate such violations

Chapter 2.43 (Code Hearings) or through the Lake County Circuit Court. (Ord.
2023-O-8)
15.01.200: PENALTIES AND VILLAGE ABATEMENT:
   A.   General Penalty. Any person, firm, corporation, or entity which
violates any of the provisions of this title or other applicable codes or
ordinances of the Village, or who disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to
comply with, or who resists the enforcement of, any of the provisions of this
title, applicable Village codes and ordinances, the approved plans and
documents of the building permit, or any certificate or other permit issued
under the provisions of this title, shall be guilty of an offense and punished
by a fine of not less than $50 or more than $750 for each provision of this
title violated. Each day on which such violation continues shall be considered
a separate offense.
   B.   Special Penalty for No Permit. In addition to every other penalty
provided by law, any person, firm, corporation, or entity that undertakes any
work for which a permit is required by this title without first having secured
a permit authorizing such work may be fined a sum of money at least equal to
two times the full amount of the building or other permit for such work. Such
fine is in addition to the required fee.
   C.   Stop Work Orders. Any person who shall continue any work after having

Each day on which such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense.

15.01.210: INTERPRETATIONS AND APPEALS:
   A.   Authority of the Building Official. The building official may render
interpretations of the provisions of this title and of any rule, regulation, or
condition issued or imposed pursuant to it.
   B.   Purpose Of Interpretations. The interpretation authority established by
this section is intended to recognize that the provisions of this title cannot
possibly address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied.
Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed by an interpretation of
the specific provisions of this title in light of the general and specific
purposes for which those provisions have been enacted. Because the
interpretation authority herein established is an administrative rather than a
legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or to change the essential
content of this title, but rather is intended only to allow authoritative
application of that content to specific cases.
   C.   Procedure. Any person who seeks an interpretation must file a written
application therefor with the Village's Community Development Department
stating specifically the title provisions at issue and the facts and
circumstances related to such person’s request for an interpretation. The
building official will make a decision in writing on such interpretation and
provide that written decision to the applicant within 30 days after the
application is filed. Any failure of the building official to act within 30
days, or within such further time to which the applicant may agree, will be
deemed to be a decision denying the application rendered on the day immediately
after that 30-day period.
   D.   Appeals.
      1.   Right to Appeal. A decision by the building official on an
interpretation under this section, or on the application of a provision of this
title, may be appealed to the Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee by the
filing of a written application for an appeal with the Village Administrator.
      2.   Scheduling. Within 10 days after an appeal has been filed pursuant
to this section, the building official must set a date and time for a meeting
before the Village Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee. The meeting must
take place within 30 days after the appeal has been filed.
      3.   Postponement. The appellant has the right to request one
postponement of the meeting. If a request is made, then the building official
must set the meeting for a date no more than 30 days after the first-
established date.
      4.   Meeting Procedures. The Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee may
adopt procedures governing the procedure for its meetings. Those procedures
must be consistent with the following standards:
         a.   The procedures need not require compliance with strict rules of
evidence, but must mandate that only relevant information be received.
         b.   Meetings must be open to the public. There is no requirement that
members of the public be allowed to speak at a meeting.
         c.   The appellant, the appellant’s representative, the Village, and
any person whose interests are directly affected must be given an opportunity
to be heard and may submit documents in support of their position.
         d.   At a meeting, the Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee may
receive testimony and review documents and other relevant materials.
         e.   The building official and Village Administrator may participate
fully in all proceedings, but do not vote on any decision.
      5.   Decisions. The Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee must vote on
the appeal and prepare a written recommendation within 15 days after the
conclusion of the meeting on appeal. The recommendation must be transmitted
promptly to the appellant and scheduled for consideration by the Board of
Trustees within 30 days. The Board of Trustees shall consider the
recommendation of the Building, Planning, and Zoning Committee. The Board of
Trustees shall take action on the recommendation at the next available
regularly scheduled Board Meeting. (Ord. 2023-O-8)
15.01.220: FEES:
   A.   General. No permit to begin work for new construction, alterations,
replacement, removal, demolition, relocation, or other building construction
operations or work requiring a building permit will be issued until after the
fees required for that permit, as prescribed in Title 3 of the Municipal Code,
have been paid in full to the Village and any other fees or debt owed to the
Village have been paid in full. In addition, no amendment to a permit for which
an additional fee must be paid as prescribed in this chapter will be approved
until after the additional fee has been paid in full to the Village.
   B.   Basis of Fees. The permit fee shall be as provided in the Fee Schedule
of the Village, as amended. The total construction cost of the project shall
include the value of all work performed, materials used and site improvements
made in conjunction with the permit and shall be subject to review and
adjustment by the code official if the costs submitted on the permit
application do not reflect the actual costs. Fees to be established in the
Village Fee Schedule include:
      1.   General permit fee (based on the value of the work and inspection
fees with a minimum permit fee amount regardless of valuation).
      2.   New construction (residential, non-residential).
      3.   Minor permits (equipment replacement, fixture replacement).
      4.   Exterior work (windows, doors, roof, siding).
      5.   Remodeling.
      6.   Accessory structure.
      7.   Fences.
      8.   Driveways (new construction, replacement, resurfacing).
      9.   Demolition permits (residential structure, accessory structure,
partial, non residential).
   C.   Work Without a Permit. The fee for work without a permit shall be as
listed in the Village’s Schedule of Fees, unless specific fees are described in
the relevant section of the building code. The Village may waive such fees for
emergency repair work provided that the permit is applied for in a timely
manner during regular business hours.
   D.   Additional Fees. The payment of the fees for the construction,
alteration, replacement, removal, demolition, relocation or other building
construction operations and for all other work done in connection with or
concurrently with the work contemplated by a building permit does not relieve
the applicant or holder of the permit from the obligation to pay all other fees
prescribed by law or ordinance. These fees may include:
      1.   Permit renewal fees.
      2.   Stop Work Order fees.
      3.   Work without a permit fee.
      4.   Utility fees.
      5.   License and registration fees.
   E.   Reinspection Fee: There shall be no charge for the initial inspection
for each phase of a project. For each subsequent reinspection required due to
failure of the initial inspection, the work not being ready, or inability to

a reinspection fee for each subsequent reinspection shall be charged as
provided in the Fee Schedule of the Village, as amended. Said fee must be paid
before any reinspection will be scheduled.
   F.   Miscellaneous Inspection Fees:
      1.   Miscellaneous inspections shall be charged as provided in the Fee
Schedule of the Village, as amended. This fee shall be paid before any
inspection can be made.
      2.   If it is necessary for the village to utilize an outside consultant
to perform a necessary inspection, the permittee shall be responsible for
payment of said fee prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. If an
escrow deposit has been made for payment of professional fees, this amount may
be deducted from the deposit.
   G.   After Hours, Saturday, Sunday or Holiday Inspection Fee: In the event
that a permittee requests an inspection after normal operating hours the
following procedure shall be followed:
      1.   Any person who requests an inspection to occur after normal
operating hours, on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday shall submit a written
request for such inspection and pay the additional fee as provided in the Fee
Schedule of the Village, as amended, on or before twelve o'clock (12:00) noon
of the regularly scheduled workday preceding the date requested.
      2.   The code official shall determine if Village personnel can be
provided and shall notify the person requesting such inspection whether or not
such inspection can be provided.
      3.   The fee for said inspection shall be calculated by multiplying the
hourly wage of the assigned inspector by a factor of two (2), plus the amount,
if any, of additional costs incurred by the Village for any employee benefits
to be paid as a result of such employee being employed for such additional
time.
      4.   In the event the time spent by such inspector exceeds the additional
inspection fee so prepaid, such additional amount shall be paid to the Village
before an occupancy permit for the inspected premises is issued.
   H.   Plan Review Fee:
      1.   When the total construction cost exceeds one thousand dollars
($1,000.00), the plans shall be reviewed by a qualified plan review service
unless the code official shall determine that said plans are of such a
character that the Village can adequately review for life safety, fire
protection, smoke removal and other aspects. The actual cost of this consultant
review will be paid by the building permit applicant in addition to all other
related building permit fees.
      2.   The plan review fee shall be paid at the time of building permit
application submittal. No review will be conducted until this fee is received.
      3.   All plan review fees charged by the Village include the cost of one
review and one rereview. Should more than two (2) reviews be required due to an
inadequacy of the plans and specifications submitted for review, the fees for
such additional reviews will be computed in accordance with the schedule
outlined in this section.
      4.   The plan review fee shall be based on a percentage of the building
permit fee as set forth and as provided in the Fee Schedule of the Village, as
amended.
      5.   The basic plan review fees shall contain the following elements and
the plan review fees for each of these elements shall be as provided in the Fee
Schedule of the Village, as amended:
         a.   Building code plan review:
         b.   New residential construction.
         c.   Residential alterations, additions and accessory structures.
         d.   New commercial and industrial construction.
         e.   Commercial and industrial alterations.
         f.   Mechanical Code plan review.
         g.   Plumbing Code plan review.
         h.   Electrical Code plan review.
   I.   Deposits and Bonds
      1.   Deposit or Bond Required. Every applicant must post with the
Village, at the time of issuance of a permit, all performance sureties as
required by the Municipal Code. For projects that do not have a specific bond
requirement, the bond amount shall be not less than the minimum construction
bond as listed in the Village’s Fee Schedule. The Village may waive the cash
deposit requirement if it is determined that the work is either unlikely to
impact the public right-of-way, or the scope of work is such that Village
abatement in the event of failure to complete the project is unlikely.
      2.   Village Right to Draw on Deposit. The Village has the right at all
times, at its option, to draw on the site/performance cash deposit to reimburse
the Village for the costs, including without limitation legal fees and
administrative expenses, actually incurred and reasonably estimated to be
incurred by the Village in exercising any of its rights under this title in the
event (1) the applicant undertakes any work in violation of any provision of
this title or of any permit issued or plan approved pursuant to this title or
(2) the applicant fails or refuses to complete the work authorized by any
permit issued under this title in accordance with all plans approved in
connection with said permit.
      3.   Replacement of Deposit. If the Village draws on the site/performance
cash deposit, then the applicant must replenish the deposit to the full amount
required by this section within five days after demand therefor is made to the
applicant in writing by the Village. Any failure of the applicant to fully
replenish the deposit will result in cancellation of the related permit, which
permit will not be reissued thereafter except after the filing of a new
application and paying the required fees therefor.
      4.   Return of Unused Deposit. The Village will promptly return any
unused portion of the site/performance cash deposit to the applicant, without
interest, as follows:
         a.   For all work other than a temporary sign, after proper completion
of all work.
         b.   For a temporary sign, after removal of such sign, but only if
that removal occurs within 48 hours after the permit for the temporary sign has
expired. If removal occurs later than 48 hours after the permit expired, then
the site/performance cash deposit is forfeited to the Village.
      5.   Forfeiture of Deposit. A site/performance cash deposit posted
pursuant to subsection 1 of this section shall be forfeited to the Village in
full (1) if the permittee does not request a final inspection prior to the
expiration of the permit for which the deposit was made, or (2) if the
permittee does not cure all defects in the performance of the work pursuant to
the permit for which the deposit was posted within 30 days after the specified
date for completion; or (3) if the permittee occupies the building or any
portion of the building without written permission or Certificate of Occupancy.

any street right of way, sidewalk, alley, ditch, culvert or drainageway on
public or private property, then he shall file with the village clerk, on a
form acceptable to the village, evidence that he carries public liability and
property damage insurance in the amount as provided in the fee schedule of the

commissions, officers, agents and employees, as additional insured to cover
claims which may arise out of performance of the work by the applicant or his
agents or contractors. All such insurance shall be continuing until terminated
by notice in writing to the village, given thirty (30) days in advance, and in
no event shall such insurance terminate prior to completion of the work.
   B.   Before issuance of a permit, the applicant shall be required to post a
refundable cash bond or other security with the village in a form satisfactory
to the village, such security to be to the benefit of the village. Such
security shall be the higher of one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the
determined cost of construction or as provided in the fee schedule of the
village, as amended and shall be sufficient to cover the total cost of the
improvements. Such security shall be conditioned upon the faithful observance
of the provisions of this chapter and any plans accompanying the permit. (Ord.
2014-O-36)
15.28.060: INSPECTION:
   A.   After all sections of this chapter have been fully complied with, and
restoration completed, a request for inspection and refund of bond money shall
be made in writing on a form provided by the village. Final inspections shall
be commenced by the village within three (3) working days of receipt of the
written request. The village engineer may be used for consultation on
inspections made by the village.

of the construction, they shall forthwith submit, in writing, to the village
clerk, their approval and direction to cause a refund of the cash bond.
   D.   Unsatisfactory installations shall be corrected within thirty (30) days
of any written notice from the village. If unsatisfactory installations have
not been corrected within thirty (30) days of written notice, the board of
trustees of the village may cause the replacement or completion of unfinished
or unsatisfactory work to be done, and cause the repair of any damage done to
public property by the contractor in performance of the work for which the
permit was issued, and such cost shall be deducted from the cash bond or other
security on deposit with the village, and the balance thereof shall be
returned, upon application of the depositor, and after inspection and approval
of the work by the village officers charged with such duty. (Ord. 1990-O-58 §
3)

than twelve inches (12") internal diameter. The culvert shall extend a minimum
of four feet (4') for each foot of depth on each side of the completed driveway
and there shall be adequate side slope between the edge of the driveway and the
end of the culvert pipe to prevent the entrance or obstruction of or by dirt or
fill material. This requirement may be waived in instances where a concrete,
stone or wood retaining wall is approved by the village.
   B.   Culvert pipes shall be bedded in gravel. Where the invert elevation of
the culvert pipe is three feet (3') or more, the side slope protection shall be
of bituminous material or concrete. Pipe culverts shall consist of the

   A.   Installation of ditches and swales shall be in conformance with the
site development drawing. Bottoms and side slopes shall be graded, seeded,
sodded or any other approved means of erosion protection, as approved by the
village, shall be utilized. When, in the opinion and sole discretion of the
village, it appears desirable that any rear, side or cross yard drainage
ditches or swales should be located within a lawfully dedicated easement for
such purpose, then such easement shall be furnished by the owner by a proper
written grant of easement, approved by the village attorney.
   B.   All ditches and swales, whether located in private or public property,
shall be graded with due regard to the existing surrounding terrain so as to
follow its grade to permit the normal flow of water and to assure the best
possible drainage. It shall be the obligation of the owner of the property to
remove all obstructions and debris from a ditch located on owner's property and
to keep the same at all times clean and free flowing.
   C.   In the event the owner of the property does not remove all obstructions
and debris from any ditch located on his property or keep it clean at all times
and free flowing, then the village shall have the right to clear said ditch and
charge the owner for the cost thereof. The village shall have the right to file
a lien against the property in the event owner does not pay the costs incurred
by the village within thirty (30) days from the date the village sends the
owner a statement for the cost of said work. (Ord. 1990-O-58 § 5)

15.28.100: HEDGES AND TREES:
Where any hedges or trees have been planted along the margin of a highway in
the culvert or right of way, the village may contract with the owner for their
destruction, and they shall be destroyed. The planting of such hedges or trees
hereafter on the margin of highway is declared to be a public nuisance and in
violation of this chapter. The cost incurred by the village shall be assessed

saturate, wash or damage the same, or by plowing in or across or on the slopes
of the side gutters or ditches, or by placing any material in such ditches, or
in any way interfering with the free flow of water therein, or leaving the
cuttings of any hedge thereon. The placing of culverts or the change of
drainage flow within the public highway right of way shall be unlawful without
first obtaining written approval and a permit from the village building
inspector. (Ord. 1990-O-58 § 7)
15.28.130: DEPOSIT OF DEBRIS ON HIGHWAY UNLAWFUL:
It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to deposit in or on the

provisions, and no excavation of land or construction of any public or private
improvements shall take place or be commenced except in conformity with this
title.
   D.   A division, conveyance, sale, or exchange of land pursuant to any of

accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm, or corporation, or
as waiving any right of the village under any section or provision existing at
the time of adopting of the ordinance set out in this title, or as vacating, or
annulling any rights obtained by any person, firm, or corporation, by lawful
action of the village, except as shall be expressly provided for in this title.
(Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.04.080: VACATION OF PLATS:
   A.   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by all of the owners of
lots in such plat by a written instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall
be attached, declaring the same to be vacated.
      1.   In order to be of force and effect, any such instrument must first
be approved by the president and the board of trustees of the village, except
as shall be expressly provided for in this title.
      2.   Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and
recorded in like manner as plats of subdivision; and being duly recorded and
filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the
plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the streets, alleys, and
public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such plat, except

The village board shall consider the certified assessed value of the subject

   D.   The administrative officers of the village shall recommend disapproval
of any petition for vacation that fails to meet the following standards:
      1.   No vacation shall be approved which creates a condition which would
not be permitted under the standards of design set forth herein unless such
vacation will, at the same time, correct a more serious condition which exists
contrary to the standards of this title.
      2.   No vacation shall be approved which will result in a violation of
the village zoning ordinance or other applicable ordinances or regulations,
unless such vacation will, at the same time, correct a more serious condition
which exists contrary to such ordinances or regulations.
   E.   A certified statement of the assessed valuation of all properties
surrounding any public right of way to be vacated shall accompany the sketch
and preliminary plat of vacation. Final petitions for vacation shall include
the following items:
      1.   Three (3) copies of the original plat certified by the Lake County

to be vacated outlined in a heavy line and hatched.
      2.   The following deeds, petitions and certificates:

public utility where said public utility has installed its facilities therein.
All such vacations shall be made upon the express condition that the abutting
property owner(s) grant to all public utilities, their successors and assigns,
the right of way or easement to operate, maintain, renew, and reconstruct their
facilities, over, or under the public right of way or easement vacated and such
condition shall be noted in the deed or plat of vacation and in the ordinance
or resolution of vacation.
   H.   The village may require the petitioner to furnish a bond or other
security in an amount determined by the village sufficient to protect the
village and to indemnify it for any suit which may be filed for damages
sustained as a result of such vacation.

in any way to limit the right and authority of the village to vacate any plat
or part thereof, or any right of way or easement or part thereof where it finds
that such vacation will serve the public interest.
   J.   It shall not be necessary to vacate a plat or part thereof in order to
proceed with a resubdivision of said plat or part thereof. Resubdivision
according to the procedure and standards for subdivision required by this title
shall automatically constitute vacation of a prior plat or part thereof;
provided, that monetary remuneration shall be paid to the village in
consideration of any excess public property vacated over that dedicated in the
subdivision.
   K.   Bonded contracts for the improvements of platted streets or alleys
shall be automatically canceled upon vacation of such platted streets or

16.12.040: Appeals
16.12.050: Amendments
16.12.010: APPROVAL; REQUIRED FINDINGS:
Where the president and board of trustees find that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with this title and/or
the purposes of this title may be served to greater extent by an alternative
proposal, it may approve variances to this title so that substantial justice
may be done and the public interest secured; provided, that such variances
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this title;
and further provided, the president and board of trustees shall not approve
variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it
in each specific case that:
   A.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and the proposed
variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the petitioner, but will
alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship which will result if the
strict letter of the regulations of this title were carried out and which
particular hardship or practical difficulty is not generally applicable to
other property within the same zoning district. The loss of lots, or a
reduction in the size or number of buildings that will fit on a lot, in and of
themselves is not a hardship.
   B.   The alleged hardship has not been created by any person presently
having a proprietary interest in the subject property.
   C.   The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood.
   D.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the public
streets, increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety.
   E.   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character or
appearance of that neighborhood.
   F.   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent of this
title.
   G.   The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of the zoning
ordinance, official comprehensive plan, or official map of the village. (Ord.
2004-O-14 § 1)

state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by
the applicant. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.12.030: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:
In approving variances, the president and board of trustees may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially, the objectives of
the standards or requirements of this title. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)

      2.   Grading of all lots within the village shall be accomplished in such
a manner as to prevent ponding in excess of eighteen inches (18") in the event
of a complete failure of the storm sewer system. Parking lots shall be graded
such that no ponding in excess of eight inches (8") occurs in the event of a
complete failure of the storm sewer.
      3.   Grading shall be completed on each lot such that overland water flow
is directed away from all sides of the foundation. Unless otherwise approved by
the village engineer, all grades on a lot shall be a minimum of two percent
(2%) and a maximum of ten percent (10%). If steeper slopes are approved,
sodding, retaining walls or other special treatments may be required to protect
the slopes.
      4.   No grading shall be allowed within ten feet (10') of the exterior
existing property line. Maximum berm or embankment slope shall be four
horizontal to one vertical (4:1) (unless approved by the village engineer with
appropriate stabilization measures), and shall not exceed a maximum height of
six feet (6'). Maximum height restrictions also apply to total retaining wall
height, and cumulative embankment, berm and retaining wall height. If retaining
walls are to be utilized, the maximum height of each retaining wall shall be
three feet (3'). If retaining walls are to be utilized in series, retaining
walls shall be separated by a minimum eight foot (8') wide safety shelf. Berm
and embankment heights over six feet (6') shall require the submission of cross
sections drawn to scale indicating line of sight from adjoining properties,
proposed structures in the vicinity of the embankment and proposed mitigating
landscape features for village board approval.
      5.   Grading plans shall be submitted for all developments; except, that
a single-family residence which results in a hydrologic disturbance of less
than five hundred (500) square feet and which is deemed by the village to
provide no impact to overland storm water flows, depressional storage, defined
or potential wetlands or floodplains does not have to provide a grading plan.
The grading plan shall indicate existing grades within a minimum of one hundred
feet (100') of the development. Prior to final approval and acceptance of
public improvements, an as built grading plan shall be submitted. In cases
where individual lot grading is not completed at the time of final acceptance
or where public improvements are not required, grading plans for the lots shall
be submitted and approved prior to building permits being issued and the as
built grading plans shall be submitted prior to occupancy permits being issued.
   B.   Erosion And Sedimentation Control:
      1.   All developments shall include a plan for soil erosion and
sedimentation control. Soil erosion and sedimentation control shall be in
conformance with this title, the Beach Park watershed development ordinance
(chapter
15.32 of this code), and the NPDES storm water discharge permit.
      2.   Except as provided herein, no plat of subdivision or development
plan shall be approved unless the plat or plan and accompanying materials
indicate measures to be taken to control erosion and sedimentation will be
adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm
event of a ten (10) year frequency or less, and that the following principles
shall be applicable to all development activities in the area to be subdivided:
         a.   Development plans shall consider the topography and soil of the
site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible
and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.
         b.   Natural vegetation shall be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses shall be left
undisturbed wherever possible.
         c.   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
         d.   Erosion control and sedimentation control measures shall be
installed and maintained for any land undergoing development in accordance with
the procedures and standards for urban soil erosion and sedimentation control
in Illinois.
         e.   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways shall be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion, and shall be
protected against erosion and sedimentation during development.
         f.   Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon as
practical during development.
      3.   The erosion and sedimentation control plan shall include the
following information:
         a.   A vicinity map, in sufficient detail to enable easy location in
the field of the site for which plat approval is sought. The vicinity map shall
include the site boundary lines, site acreage, legend, and scale.
         b.   A plan of the site showing:
            (1)   The existing topography of the site and adjacent land within
approximately one hundred feet (100') of the boundaries, drawn at no greater
than two foot (2') contour intervals and clearly portraying the conformation
and drainage pattern of the area.
            (2)   The location of existing buildings, structures, utilities,
water bodies, floodplains, drainage facilities, vegetative cover, paved areas
and other significant natural or manmade features on the site and adjacent land
within approximately one hundred feet (100') of the boundary.
            (3)   A general description of the predominant soil types on the
site, their location, and their limitations for the proposed use.
            (4)   The proposed use of the site, including present development
and planned utilization; areas of excavation, grading and filling; proposed
contours; finished grades and street profiles; provisions for storm drainage
with a drainage area map and computations; and areas and acreages proposed to
be paved, covered, sodded or seeded, stabilized with vegetation or left
undisturbed.

methods of the construction work and shall bear full responsibility for
insuring that the water distribution system meets the requirements of the
village.
            (2)   The village engineer will inspect the water distribution
system during construction as it deems necessary. The village engineer shall
not be responsible to direct the work of the developer but shall be responsible
only to assess the acceptability of the improvement as constructed. In no case
shall the village engineer be responsible for day to day quality control of the
construction.
         b.   Testing:
            (1)   The completed water mains and appurtenances of the water
distribution system shall be tested to the satisfaction of the village
engineer.
            (2)   All newly laid water mains shall be subjected to a minimum
hydrostatic pressure of 150 psi maintained for not less than two (2) hours.
Each valved section of pipe shall be filled with water and the specified test
pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe. Hydrants
included in the test section shall be tested with the auxiliary valve open and
the hydrant closed. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall
be expelled from the pipe. All leaks shall be repaired until tight. Any cracked
or defective pipes, fittings, valves, or hydrants discovered shall be replaced
and the test repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. No visible
leakage is allowed regardless of the results of the pressure and leakage tests.
            (3)   The test pressure shall be maintained for the test period
within 5 psi of the test pressure. If repumping is required, the amount of
water added to the test section shall be recorded. The test section will be
accepted only if the leakage determined under the test pressure is less than
the allowable leakage. At the conclusion of the test period, the test section
shall be returned to the test pressure by repumping. If the total amount of
water added to the test section exceeds the allowable leakage, the test fails
and the section shall be retested. Allowable leakage shall be determined by the
following formulas:
         For ductile iron piping (AWWA C600):
               L = S x D x P2
                  133,200
      Where:
      L   =   allowable leakage, in gallons per hour
      S   =   length of pipe tested, in feet
      D   =   nominal diameter of pipe tested, in inches
      P   =   test pressure, in psi
         For PVC water main (AWWA C605):
               L = N x D x P2
                  7,400
      Where:
      L   =   allowable leakage, in gallons per hour
      N   =   number of joints in length of pipeline tested
      D   =   nominal diameter of the pipe, in inches
      P   =   test pressure, in psi
      6.   Preliminary Flushing: Prior to testing and chlorination, the main
shall be thoroughly flushed. If there is no hydrant at the end of a main, a tap
shall be provided large enough to effect a velocity in the main of at least two
and one-half feet per second (21/2 ft/s).

with experience in the methods and techniques of this operation. The choice of
the testing firm shall be subject to the approval of the village engineer.
         b.   The chlorinating agent shall be introduced at the beginning of
the pipeline extension or any valved section of it through a corporation stop
in the top of the newly laid pipe. The preferred source of chlorine is a gas
water mixture. Other methods shall be submitted for approval to the village
engineer.
         c.   Water from the existing distribution system or other source of
supply shall be controlled so it flows slowly into the newly laid pipe during
the application of the chlorine gas.
         d.   The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be in such proportion to
the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine dose applied to the water
entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least forty parts per million (40
ppm), or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period.
         e.   The valves shall be adjusted so that the chlorine solution in the
line being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water.
         f.   Treated water shall remain in the pipe for at least twenty four
(24) hours. The chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other
representative points shall then be measured to be twenty parts per million (20
ppm) or more. If the amount of residual chlorine is too low, the pipeline
extension shall be rechlorinated.
         g.   After chlorination, the pipeline extension shall be thoroughly
flushed until the Illinois environmental protection agency and village engineer
approve the replacement water as safe. The water shall be tested over a period
of two (2) days. Test samples shall be drawn in the presence of the village
engineer from taps located as directed by the village engineer and installed by
the developer. The village engineer shall approve testing agencies.
Chlorination and testing shall continue until satisfactory results are
obtained.
         h.   Disinfection for pipe that must be placed in service immediately
shall be accomplished by thoroughly flushing and swabbing with a strong (150
ppm) solution of hypochlorite immediately prior to assembly. Permission must be
secured from the village engineer before this type of disinfection will be
approved.
         i.   All water disposed of from flushing operations shall not contain
chlorine concentrations exceeding 0.05 parts per million. All flushing water
exceeding this concentration shall be dechlorinated.
         j.   The cost of flushing, disinfection, sampling, and testing shall
be borne by the developer.
      8.   Repairs Permanent; Equal In Quality: Repairs made to the water
system in order to fulfill the requirements of this section shall be permanent
and shall be equal in quality to new work constructed in accordance with this
section. All such repairs shall be at the expense of the developer. Repairs to
the water system will require repetition of all tests. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)

(4.5') from the ground. Based upon the survey, the village board may designate
which existing features would add value to the development or subdivision or to
the village as a whole, such as trees, watercourses, historic spots, and
similar irreplaceable assets, and which of them shall be preserved in the
design of the development or subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any
development or subdivision, nor any change of grade of the land effected, until
approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees required by the
village board to be retained shall be guarded and preserved by use of a "no
activity zone" with a minimum radius in feet equivalent to the drip line of the
tree. The "no activity zone" shall be clearly marked with tree protection
fencing, and all trees, where required, shall be welled and protected against
change of grade.
   D.   Ground Cover: The village board shall require that all disturbed areas
within the development or subdivision, including unimproved areas within the

   I.   Underground Utility Placement: No underground utilities or storm
sewers, except inlet drains, shall be installed under the pavement in streets,
alleys, service roads, or highways. Service connections to such underground
utilities and sewers shall be extended to the property line of each lot so as
to obviate disturbing the surface improvements in such public ways when service
connections are later made. Where underground utilities are located in the
parkway adjacent to the paved roadway, service connections to properties across
such roadway shall only be made by drilling under the pavement in such a way
that surfacing is not disturbed or weakened, and excavation shall be compacted
granular backfill and properly restored. The current Illinois "Standard
Specifications For Water And Sewer Main Construction", latest edition, shall
apply.
   J.   Debris Removal: The developer shall clean and maintain all public ways,
sewers, and drains free from debris, trash or other extraneous material during
construction to prevent the creation of a public nuisance. The developer shall
clean all such public ways, sewers and drains of all debris, trash or other
extraneous material prior to acceptance by the village.
   K.   Modifications Of Design Improvements During Construction: During the
course of construction, the project representative shall note any circumstances
which necessitate departures from the plans and specifications for the
improvements, as approved, including, but not limited to, an unforeseen
difficulty in drainage, ground water, poor subsoil, unstable fill material, or
unconventional or faulty practices of subcontractors. Whenever such departures
are likely to cause a lower ultimate level of performance than could reasonably
have been anticipated, the representative shall prepare a report of his
findings of the situation and promptly forward copies to the village engineer.
   L.   Connections: No permanent connection shall be made with the sanitary
sewer, storm sewer, or water distribution system until appropriate testing for
the public improvements has been successfully completed, such connection has
been approved by the village and all permit fees for the connection have been
paid. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)

16.24.020: IMPROVEMENTS; COMPLETION GUARANTEE:
   A.   Prior to the approval of the final plat of subdivision, the applicant
shall guarantee the installation of any and all required public improvements at
his own expense in accordance with the plans and specifications required under
the terms of this chapter and within the time required as a condition for
approval, which completion guarantee may take the form of any of the following,
at the option of the applicant:
      1.   A subdivision bond, with sufficient corporate surety in the form
approved by the village attorney and payable to the village; or
      2.   An irrevocable straight line commercial letter of credit with any
recognized financial institution in the form acceptable to the village
attorney; or
      3.   A noninterest bearing cash escrow consisting of a cash deposit or
certified or cashier's check in the total amount required, which shall be
placed with the village treasurer and administered in accordance with the
provisions of the escrow agreement to be negotiated by and between the village
president and the applicant, and approved by the village attorney. Such
agreement shall contain provisions for specific application of such funds,
partial contract payouts, pro rata reduction of deposit excess, final escrow
settlement and other pertinent administrative matters as may be required.
   B.   The amount of the completion guarantee shall be based upon the
following (whichever is higher):
      1.   Total cost for estimated construction, engineering, surveying and
fees for all required public improvements, plus twenty five percent (25%) of
such total for contingencies, as approved by the village engineer; or
      2.   Total contract cost for construction, engineering, surveying and

percent (25%) of such total contingencies, as approved by the village engineer.
   C.   The amount of the letter of credit, cash, or other securities may be
reduced upon successful completion of the improvements. The village engineer
must inspect the public improvements and recommend any reduction. A letter of
credit may be reduced, and cash and other securities released in part upon
completion of public improvements. At no time prior to final acceptance of the
project shall the amount of the letter of credit, cash or other securities be
reduced to an amount which is less than one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the estimated cost to complete the remaining public improvements, plus
twenty five percent (25%) of the actual cost of the completed public
improvements, all as approved by the village engineer. In no event shall the
amount of a letter of credit or cash and other securities be reduced to an
amount below twenty five percent (25%) of the initial principal amount of the
letter of credit, cash or other security, unless approved by the village board.
   D.   No developer shall fail to pay any contractor or subcontractor for work
performed such that a lien arises upon the public funds of the village. If any
such lien is perfected, the village in its discretion may draw upon the
developer's letter of credit, cash or other security posted in accordance with
this title to pay any such lien. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.030: IMPROVEMENTS; MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE:
The aforesaid required public improvements shall become the property of the
village after construction of such improvements by the applicant or his
designated representative, followed by approval of such construction and
installation by the president and the board of trustees of the village.
   A.   Immediately upon the aforesaid approval by the president and board of
trustees, the applicant shall give title to such water mains, sanitary sewer
mains and other public improvements to the village by a proper bill of sale.
   B.   Furthermore, not later than at the time of said approval by the village
and the giving of the aforesaid bill of sale by the applicant, the applicant
shall have posted with the village adequate surety consisting of ten percent
(10%) of the actual construction cost in the form of a letter of credit,
maintenance bond, cash deposit or certified or cashier's check.
   C.   The final release of the original maintenance guarantee, less any costs
of repairs covering a subdivision's improvement work held for the two (2) year
guarantee period will be predicated upon an inspection of all improvements
including a leak detection test of the subdivision's water main segments, and a
videotape recording of a television inspection at all sanitary sewer mains
conducted within sixty (60) days of the expiration of the two (2) year
guarantee period. An approved qualified leak detection specialist will perform
this test. The test results will be forwarded to the village engineer for final
determination of an acceptable level of leakage. The village engineer will
then, based on the test results, recommend the final release of the remaining
letter of credit or other maintenance surety sum still being held for the water
main and sanitary sewer main guarantees. Such deposit shall be posted with the
village under the terms of section
16.24.020 of this chapter. Such deposit shall be held by the village for a
period of twenty four (24) months after the final acceptance of such
improvements for the purpose of:
      1.   Guaranteeing against and securing the correction of any defect in
material or workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character
and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the
village;
      2.   Guaranteeing against and securing the correction of any damage to
such improvements by reason of settling of the ground, base, or foundation
thereof.
   D.   Such maintenance guarantee shall also provide that as such defects
develop, the cash deposit may be applied by the village for any amounts
incurred to correct such defects and that the balance of such deposit, if any,
held at the end of such twenty four (24) month period, shall be returned by the
village to the depositor without interest. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.040: IMPROVEMENTS; DEVELOPER AGREEMENT; APPROVAL:
The developer's agreement shall be approved by the president and board of
trustees as to amount, surety and other conditions. The planning commission may
upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the president and board of trustees an
extension of the completion date set forth in the developer's agreement for a
maximum period of one additional year. The village president and board of
trustees may at any time during the period of the developer's agreement accept
a substitution of principal or sureties called for in the developer's
agreement. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.050: IMPROVEMENTS; DEVELOPER AGREEMENT; TERMS AND CONDITIONS:
The developer's agreement shall include the following terms and conditions:
   A.   Temporary Improvement: The applicant shall build and pay for all costs
of temporary improvements required by the planning commission and shall
maintain those improvements for the period specified. Prior to the construction
of any temporary facility or improvement, the applicant shall file with the
village a separate bond for the temporary facilities; the bond shall be
sufficient as to amount and form to ensure that the temporary facilities will
be properly constructed, maintained, and removed.
   B.   Costs Of Improvements: All required improvements shall be made by the
applicant, at his expense, without reimbursement by the village or any other
public entity.
   C.   Failure To Complete Improvements, For Subdivisions Or Developments, For
Which Bond Has Been Posted: The approval shall be deemed to have expired if the
improvements are not completed within the period specified. In those cases
where a bond has been posted and the required improvements have not been
installed within the terms of such bond, the village may thereupon declare the
bond to be in default and require that all the improvements shall be installed
regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the bond is
declared to be in default.
   D.   Acceptance Of Dedication Offers: Acceptance or formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be by motion
adopted by the president and board of trustees. The approval by the planning
commission of a subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the
acceptance by the village of any street, easement, park or other public
interest in land shown on the plat. The planning commission may require the
plat to be endorsed with statements to this effect.
   E.   Inspection Of Improvements; Fees: The village president shall cause
inspection of the required improvements to be made during construction to
ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the village
inspection fees in amounts specified from time to time by resolution adopted by
the president and board of trustees. These fees shall be due and payable upon
demand by the village, and no building permits or certificates of occupancy
shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the village engineer finds upon
inspection that any of the required improvements have not been constructed in
accordance with village construction standards and specifications, the
applicant shall complete the improvements as required. Whenever the cost of
improvements is covered by a bond, the applicant and the bonding company shall
be jointly and severally liable for completing the improvements according to
specifications. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.060: IMPROVEMENTS; MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Any action of any board, commission, group, officer, agent, or employee
of the village or any approval of any plat or plan to the contrary
notwithstanding, until the adoption of such motion by the president and the
board of trustees formally accepting said public improvements, all such public
improvements shall remain the property of the applicant, who shall have full
and complete obligation for repair and maintenance and shall be responsible for
keeping said improvements free from debris, trash, snow and other extraneous
material to prevent the creation of a public nuisance.
   B.   The developer shall maintain and repair all required improvements
including snow and ice removal on streets and sidewalks, if necessary, until
acceptance of said improvements by the village board. If any necessary
maintenance and repairs are not made to the required improvements in a timely
fashion by the developer, the village may, on twelve (12) hours notice' to the
developer, effect such repairs or maintenance, and shall charge the costs of
the same to the developer.
   C.   The developer shall maintain the streets and roadways in a safe
passable condition. The village may effect such ice or snow removal in less
than the twelve (12) hours if, in the opinion of the superintendent of public
works or such other appropriate official of the village, the streets are unsafe
for emergency vehicles. The cost of same shall be charged to the developer.
   D.   Any such repair or maintenance costs or snow and ice removal costs may
be charged to the developer's letter of credit, cash or other security. (Ord.
2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.070: IMPROVEMENTS; DEFERRAL OR WAIVER:
   A.   At the time of final approval, and subject to appropriate conditions,
the planning commission and the president and board of trustees may defer or
waive the provision of any or all such improvements as it deems not to be
necessary and in the interests of the public health, safety, and general
welfare, or which are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities.
   B.   Whenever the president and board of trustees deems it necessary to
defer the construction of any improvement required herein because of
incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate connecting facilities or for
other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the costs of the future
improvement to the village prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat,
or sign the village standard restrictive covenant waiving right to protest
future special assessment, or the applicant may post a bond ensuring completion
of the improvement upon demand of the village. Should the village board approve
deferral of public road improvements for an individual lot development,
including single-family residences, the applicant will be required to supply
the village with an actual cost of construction for public improvements from a
licensed engineer. The application will be subject to review and acceptance by
the village engineer. Once accepted, the applicant shall then escrow into a
public improvement fund one-half (1/2) of that amount for installation of
public improvements (applicant's obligation). Capital from the public
improvement fund will be available for public street improvements in the
village as deemed necessary by the public works department.
   C.   The street improvements and appurtenances associated with the
development may be completed upon eighty percent (80%) of the total units being
occupied in a subdivision with the approval of the village engineer, or as
otherwise approved by the village engineer. Upon completion and approval by the
village engineer, the developer may deposit with the village a sum determined
by the village in an amount equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the value of
the street system work. This deposit will relieve the developer of any further
maintenance responsibility, including the three (3) year guarantee that would
otherwise be required. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)
16.24.080: ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY:
With respect to any final plat of subdivision wherein the final plat thereof
has been approved by the village president and board of trustees and recorded
with the recorder of deeds of the county:
   A.   No building permit shall be issued unless the extent of street
improvements shall be adequate for vehicular police and fire equipment access
to a proposed building site prior to the issuance of a building permit.
   B.   No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent (10%) of
the lots in the subdivision (as determined by the village) or, if ten percent
(10%) of the total number of lots be lesser than two (2) lots, for the final
two (2) lots of a subdivision until all public improvements required by the
planning commission and approved by the president and board of trustees for the
plat have been fully completed and dedicated to the village and such dedication
formally accepted by the president and board of trustees.
   C.   Where a satisfactory bond has been required for a subdivision, no
certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued
prior to the completion and dedication of the improvements as required by the
president and board of trustees upon approval of the final plat. (Ord. 2004-O-
14 § 1)
16.24.090: ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS AND RELEASE OF BOND:

16.26.012: Requirements For Contributions To Applicable School Districts
16.26.013: Indemnification
16.26.010: REQUIREMENTS FOR DEDICATION OF PARK LAND:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of
a planned unit development for six (6) or more lots, land for park and
recreational purposes, or cash contributions in lieu of land, or a combination
of both, at the option of the village, shall be provided to serve those needs
specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of the subdivision or
planned unit development. Planning studies indicate that the population growth
in the village which accompanies new developments will accelerate in the coming
years which will result in the rapid disappearance of available land and the
marked increase in land values. The village has found that a healthful,
productive community life depends in part on the quality of local parks. The
village has found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health,
welfare, and safety require the establishment of park sites and facilities
serving the new residents of the village. Demographic studies of the
residential portions of a proposed subdivision or planned unit development can
be readily and scientifically conducted to determine the number of children and
adults to be generated therefrom and provide data by which the required
dedications of land and capital costs specifically and uniquely attributable to
the activity of the developer and the proposed subdivision or planned unit
development may be calculated. This land or cash or combination thereof shall
be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula:
   A.   Criteria For Park And Recreational Land Requirements:
      1.   Land Requirement And Population Ratio: The amount of land required
for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct function of
the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The total
requirement shall be fifteen (15) acres of land per one thousand (1,000)
persons of ultimate population computed in accordance with the table of
estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, included in section
16.26.011 of this chapter.
      2.   Location: The location and configuration of the site to be dedicated
shall be determined by the village board, which shall take into account the
comprehensive plan of the village, the suitability of the site for park
purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations and its
proximity to other park or recreational lands. Donated land should be
reasonably accessible and should be centrally located to all lots within the
impacted area, where feasible.
      3.   Minimum Size, Topography, Soils, Improvements And Landscaping:
         a.   Minimum Size: The minimum size of land to be dedicated for park
and recreational purposes shall be no less than one acre, one dimension of
which cannot be less than one hundred feet (100'). However, the village board
may recommend, and the village board may approve, dedications of smaller sizes,
when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness
of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated.
         b.   Topography And Soils:
            (1)   The site must be graded to meet topography and to meet
existing drainage patterns.
            (2)   At least eighty percent (80%) of the donated land for park
and recreational purposes shall be suitable in topography and soil types for
recreational facilities.
            (3)   The soil shall allow construction of recreational facilities
and have a soil bearing capacity to support recreational facilities.
"Recreational facilities" are defined as "buildings and other physical features
set aside in a park site that are used by participants of the community".
Examples of recreational facilities include, but are not limited to, a swimming
pool complex, playground picnic shelter, picnic sites, baseball/softball field,
football/soccer field, various games activity courts, tennis court, basketball
court, volleyball court, restroom/storage building, community center and
waterfront area.
         c.   Improvements And Landscaping:
            (1)   Each park site shall have sanitary and storm sewer, water,
electricity, and gas available at the property lines of the dedicated site when
these utilities are required in the development or subdivision.
            (2)   A designated paved parking area with curbing not to exceed
nine (9) spaces and one disabled space for a total of ten (10) spaces, and
located in close proximity to a dedicated street shall be provided in park
sites over one acre.
            (3)   All seeding shall be of an acceptable stand of grass suitable
for recreational uses to meet village specifications. The type of seed to be
planted shall be subject to village review and approval prior to final plat
approval. A minimum of six (6) trees per acre, at least two and one-half inch
(2.5") caliper measured one foot (1') from the ground, shall be planted. The
number and placement of trees shall be subject to village review and approval
prior to final plat approval.
            (4)   Wetlands, floodplain and detention areas for storm water
control shall not normally qualify as land for park and recreational purposes,
but may be approved by the village board if an acceptable recreational use can
be demonstrated or the area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to
protect a significant natural resource.
            (5)   If appropriate, the village may require an environmental site
assessment to identify potential concerns. No site that has been part of an
unlicensed landfill or a toxic waste dump shall be acceptable for park and
recreational purposes.
            (6)   Land for park and recreational purposes shall not be
privately owned and maintained unless specifically approved by the village
board. The detailed plans for all improvements for such park and recreational
land that is privately owned and maintained shall be subject to review and
approval by the village board. Guarantees of the permanency of the use and
maintenance of such privately owned and maintained park and recreational open
space, satisfactory to the village, shall be entered into by the developer. The
guarantees may include covenants and/or express provisions in the articles of
condominium ownership or constitution and bylaws of a homeowner's association
as determined by the village board.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites: Where the
development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be
practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and
recreational purposes, as determined by the village board, the developer shall
pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required.
      1.   Cash Contribution In Lieu Of Park And Recreational Land Dedication:
         a.   The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land
dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or another public body
designated by the village, for use in the acquisition or improvement of park
and recreational land. The cash contributions shall be available to serve the
immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development
or for the improvement of any existing local park and recreational land which
already serves such needs.
         b.   The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair
market value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been
dedicated as a park and recreational site. The fair market value, on a per acre
basis, shall assume that the land is zoned residential, subdivided, stubbed
with village sewer and water, has all appropriate utilities available, is
improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential
development. The fair market value shall be based upon a study of real estate
transactions in Lake County for the past three (3) years and as approved by the
village board based upon real estate transactions and any other indicators as
to value. This figure shall be adjusted annually by the village board based on
real estate transactions and any other indicators as to value. The fair market
value, as defined above, shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land
contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in of this title.
Objections to the fair market value, as defined above, shall be made to the
village board in accordance with the procedure contained in this title. Failure
to timely object to the fair market value, as defined above, in accordance with
the provisions of this title shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an
objection at a later time.
      2.   Refund Of Cash Contributions: If any portion of a cash contribution
in lieu of a park and recreational land dedication is not expended for the
purposes set forth herein twenty (20) years from the date of receipt, it shall
be refunded to the developer who made such contributions.
      3.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: A combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required, when:
         a.   The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or
adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of
the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient
for the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that
would have been required to be dedicated; or
         b.   A major part of the local park or recreational site has already
been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision
or development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required
by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
      4.   Criteria For A Fully Developed Park: A fully developed park,
including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping, and recreational
equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is
limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision
can be satisfied with a smaller but fully developed park with a more intensive
activity level.
   C.   Objections: All objections relating to acreage requirements,
presumptions as to fair market value, park donation requirements, or any other
application of this section relative to the dedication of park lands and school
sites or for payment of fees in lieu thereof, to a particular lot, subdivision
or planned development, shall be referred to the village board for hearing. An
objection must be made, if at all, prior to the approval by the village board
of the final plat of subdivision or planned unit development. Where a plat of
subdivision is not required, any objection must be made before the issuance of
any building permit. A failure to object by such time shall constitute a waiver
of the right to object to the provisions of this title.
      1.   Contents: All objections shall be in writing and at a minimum
contain the following information:
         a.   Specific identification of the exact data, calculation or other
determination to which an objection is being made;
         b.   A detailed written basis for each and every objection made with
specific reference to all data, written documentation and/or testimony on which
each and every objection is based;
         c.   A specific detailed statement setting forth the proper data,
calculation or determination which the objector believes should be made under
this title with specific and detailed reference to any data, documentary
information and oral testimony supporting said position or belief;
         d.   Copies of all data, and/or any other documentary evidence upon
which the objector intends to rely;
         e.   Where any data is submitted, the objection shall make a specific
reference as to the source of such data;
         f.   Where any studies performed by or on the behalf of the objector
or any other source are submitted, the objector shall further submit detailed
information concerning the methods and procedures used in the study to collect
and analyze data;
         g.   Where any documentary or other evidence upon which the objector
relies refers to other sources of information and/or back up materials from
which data or information was gathered, the objector shall provide copies of
such back up data and/or information;
         h.   The legal and common description of the properties affected by
the objection.
      2.   Completeness Of Objection: All objections shall contain every and
any objection being made. Any objections that are not specifically set forth
shall forever be deemed waived.
      3.   Undue Hardship: Where any objector believes the information required
to be contained in the objection creates an undue hardship, the objector shall
include with its objection a sworn certification stating specific and detailed
reasons why all the information required cannot be supplied and all reasons why
the objector believes that requiring this information is an undue hardship.
      4.   Procedure For Making An Objection: Eight (8) copies of every
objection shall be served upon the village clerk or designee. If the objection
is served on the village clerk or designee ten (10) or more business days
before the next regularly scheduled board meeting, the objection shall be
formerly presented to the village board at its next regularly scheduled
meeting. If the objection is served upon the village clerk or designee less
than ten (10) business days before the board's next regularly scheduled
meeting, the objection shall be formally presented to the village board at the
first regularly scheduled village board meeting which is ten (10) or more days
after the date the objection is received by the village clerk or designee. When
the village clerk or designee receives an objection he or she shall notify the
objector of the date at which the objection shall be formally presented to the
village board. The objector and/or the objector's representative shall appear
at the date scheduled for the presentment of the objection to the village
board. On the date the objection is formally presented the village board, the
objectors and the village board, shall set a date for a hearing on the
objection. The village board shall have at least thirty (30) calendar days to
review and develop information to be presented at the hearing on the objection.
If the village board believes additional time is necessary, the village board
shall so advise the objector at the time the objection is formally presented to
the village board. The factors to be considered in determining whether
additional review time may be required include but are not limited to: a) the
length of the objection and the amount of supporting data contained in it; b)
whether all back up data studies and reports have been submitted with the
objection; c) the village board's need to undertake additional study or gather
additional information to consider at the hearing; and d) the complexity of the
issues involved.
      5.   Hearing: The hearing shall take place at a regularly scheduled
village board meeting or other special meeting duly noticed and called for said
purpose. The hearing shall take place on the date and time set by the village
board. The village president shall preside over the hearing and render
decisions on any testimonial and/or evidentiary questions that arise with the
advice of the village attorney. The objector shall have the right to be
represented by counsel and the right to present oral and documentary evidence
to the village board. The objector and the village board all have the
opportunity to cross examine each other's witnesses. Any member of the village
board shall have the right to ask questions of any witness at any time. The
objector and the village board shall be provided the opportunity to present
rebuttal testimony and/or documentation. After the objector and the village
board have submitted their testimony and documentation, the village board shall
give interested members of the public the right to be heard. The village board
shall have the right to continue the hearing from time to time on its own
motion or on the request of the objector. The village board shall deliberate in
public and shall issue its written decision on each objection within thirty
(30) days of the conclusion of the hearing. The village board may accept or
reject the objector's position in whole or in part.
      6.   Notice Of Hearing: At least once, not more than twenty (20) nor less
than fifteen (15) calendar days before the hearing, the objector shall publish
in one or more newspapers published in the village or a newspaper with a
general circulation in the village, a notice setting forth the date, time and
place for the scheduled hearing on the objection. The notice shall identify the
nature of the objector's objection, the relief requested, identify the property
or properties involved by both legal and common descriptions and invite any
interested members of the public to attend. At the opening of the scheduled
hearing the objector shall initially furnish to the board proof that it has
complied with the requirements of this subsection C6.
   D.   Special Provisions For Park And Recreation Donations:
      1.   Annexation: The dedication of land, cash contribution in lieu
thereof and donation of capital costs required by this title of a platted
subdivision or planned unit development shall also be required as a condition
of the annexation of any land to the village, and shall be incorporated in any
development agreement, preannexation or annexation agreement governing such
land. However, the village reserves the right to negotiate dedications of land
or cash in lieu of land and donations for capital costs which are greater than
those set forth herein.
      2.   Schedule Of Donations:
         a.   The cash in lieu of land contribution and capital cost donation
imposed by this title shall be made by a certified or cashier's check payable
directly to the village and held by the village.
         b.   Fifty percent (50%) of any projected cash in lieu of land
donation and capital cost donations imposed by this title shall be due and
payable for each unit to be built prior to final plat approval of the
subdivision or final approval of a planned unit development. Prior to the
issuance of a building permit for each unit to be built, the balance of all
cash in lieu of land donations and the balance of all capital cost donations
relating to that unit shall be due and payable.
         c.   In calculating the total amount of any cash in lieu of land
contribution imposed by this title, the village shall use the fair market value
of property in effect at the time of building permit issuance. In calculating
the total capital cost contribution imposed by this title, the village shall
use the capital costs in effect at the time of building permit issuance.
         d.   For cash in lieu of land donations and capital cost donations
payable prior to the issuance of any building permit, the village board shall
issue a receipt for each lot or unit which shows that payment of the full cash
in lieu of land donation and/or capital cost donation has been received. Each
such receipt issued for donations received prior to the issuance of building
permits shall identify the name of the builder/developer requesting the permit
and specifically designate the subdivision and lot or unit to which the
donation is referred.
         e.   At the time the first donation is made, the developer shall
provide to the village board a copy of the approved plat of subdivision or
other document showing all lots which are proposed to be developed. In the
event any amendments or changes are made to the approved plat of subdivision or
plat of planned unit development, the developer shall submit a revised plat of
subdivision or planned unit development identifying all lots and showing all
changes or revisions which have been made. The village board shall use the
plats of subdivision or plats of planned unit development provided to mark off
those lots for which the full cash donation has been paid.
      3.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan or
standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land
in a particular subdivision or development than the developer is required by
this title to dedicate, the land needed in excess of the required dedication
shall be reserved by the developer for subsequent acquisition by the village or
other public body designated by the village; provided, that such acquisition is
started within one year from the date of approval of the final plat.
      4.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: Park or recreational land
dedications may be combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and
developments in order to produce usable recreational areas without hardship on
a particular developer.
      5.   Improvements: All sites shall have a portion of their frontage
improved with water and sanitary utility lines, electrical and gas service, and
fully improved streets.
      6.   Dedication At Time Of Approval Of Final Plat: Approval of any final
plat of subdivision or any final planned unit development plat shall be
conditioned upon the dedication of land or cash donations in lieu thereof as
required by this title. Dedications of such land or cash in lieu thereof may be
made at such other time as is specifically approved by the village board.
      7.   Storage Of Materials Prohibited: No storage of any equipment and/or
material, including spoil materials or top soil, shall be permitted on any land
designated for park and recreational use.
   E.   Donations Required From Properties Outside Village Corporate Limits:
      1.   In the event that land which is subject to subdivision or planned
unit development approval by the village is not within the corporate limits of
the village at the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned
unit development for the land, the provisions of this article shall not apply
to said land with respect to any instance where the land is not within the
jurisdiction of the governmental entity to which the contribution or donation
is to be made.
      2.   However, in the event that land which is subject to subdivision
approval by the village is not within the corporate limits of the village at
the time of approval of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit development
for the land, the governing body of any governmental entity which would be
entitled to land and/or cash donations pursuant to this article, may request
that the village vary the terms of this article by allowing said governmental
entity to make its own agreement and/or waiver as to any or all of the
donations and amounts thereof required in this article with the developer of
said land. Said request shall be made in writing by a resolution adopted by the
governing board of said governmental entity. In such an event, the village may,
by motion, condition subdivision approval upon compliance with the provisions
of this section as the provisions of this title have been modified by said
variation and/or waiver. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)

16.26.012: REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO APPLICABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS:
   A.   In order to defray the capital improvements costs incurred by the
school districts specifically and uniquely attributable to subdivisions,
planned unit developments and other developments occurring within the village,
the school districts may request that the developer make land dedications or
pay capital improvement fees.
   B.   The developer of each subdivision, planned unit development or other
development within the village shall negotiate directly with each applicable
school district to establish the required land dedications or capital
improvement fees attributable to the subdivision, planned unit development or
other development prior to final plat approval by the village.
   C.   The developer shall furnish to the village documentation from each
school district regarding the nature and outcome of the negotiations, including
payment or dedication schedules, if applicable. If the developer and the
applicable school district were not successful in arriving at an agreement
concerning required fees or donations, then the documentation shall include a
description of the negotiations and the outcome.
   D.   Any required land dedications shall be so indicated on the final plat
and plan of subdivision, planned unit development or other development.
   E.   The developer of each subdivision, planned unit development and other
developments shall make all required land dedications, payment of cash in lieu
of land dedications and capital costs donations directly to the applicable
school district, and provide copies of receipts or other documentation of such
dedications or payments to the village.
   F.   The village will consider, and may require conformance to, the comments
of the school district as part of the plan and plat review procedure for the
subdivision, planned unit development or other development. While conformance
to the requirements of the applicable school district may not be a requirement
of final village approval, the village strongly encourages the developer to
arrive at an agreement with the applicable school districts. (Ord. 2004-O-14 §
1)
16.26.013: INDEMNIFICATION:
As a precondition to a school district's collection of land dedications, cash
in lieu of land dedications and capital cost donations, the school district
shall execute an agreement indemnifying the village and holding it harmless
from any damages and costs which arise out of any challenge to the validity of
this chapter. (Ord. 2004-O-14 § 1)

   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide specific regulations for the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless service
facilities. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be
interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the provision of
personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this chapter be applied
in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of
functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent that any
provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in conflict with
any other provision of the village code or any ordinance of the village, the
provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to control.
   B.   In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under
this chapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless services or to
install personal wireless service facilities, the corporate authorities shall
act within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with the
village, taking into account the nature and scope of the request, and any
decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.020: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
ascribed to them below:
ANTENNA: Any exterior apparatus or apparatuses designed for telephonic, radio,
data or internet communications through the sending and/or receiving of
electromagnetic waves including equipment attached to a tower or building for
the purpose of providing personal wireless services and its attendant base
station.
ANTENNA HEIGHT: The vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna
support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure even if the
highest point is an antenna. Measurement of tower height shall include antenna,
base pad, and other appurtenances and shall be measured from the finished grade
of the parcel. If the support structure is on a sloped grade, then the average
between the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating the antenna
height.
ANTENNA SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Any pole, telescoping mast, tower, tripod or other
structure which supports a device used in the transmitting or receiving of
radio frequency signals.
BACK HAUL PROVIDER: The lines that connect a provider's tower and a provider's
antennas to one or more switching offices and/or long distance providers of the
public switching telephone network.
CELL SITE: A tract or parcel of land that contains the personal wireless
services including any antenna, support structure, accessory building, and
parking, and may include other uses associated with an ancillary to personal
wireless services.
FAA: The federal aviation administration.
FCC: The federal communications commission.
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES, PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES AND
FACILITIES: As used in this chapter, shall be defined in the same manner as in
title 47, United States Code, section 332(c)(7)(C), and as they may be amended.
TOWER: Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose
of supporting one or more antennas, including self-supporting lattice towers,
guy towers, or monopole towers. The terms encompasses personal wireless service
facilities towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular telephone
towers, personal communications services towers, alternative tower structures,
and the like. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.030: POLICY STATEMENT:
   A.   The corporate authorities have on numerous occasions and with
increasing frequency been confronted with requests to site communications
towers and antennas. The purpose of this chapter is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of the chapter are
to: 1) encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas, or if
nonresidential areas are unavailable, then on residential property consisting
of five (5) or more acres, and to minimize the total number of towers
throughout the village; 2) encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing
tower sites; 3) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the village is minimal;
4) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that
minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and 5) enhance
the ability of the providers of personal wireless services to provide such
services throughout the village quickly, effectively and efficiently.
Accordingly, the corporate authorities finds that the promulgation of this
chapter is warranted and necessary:
      1.   To manage the location of towers and antennas in the village. All
proposed towers and antennas shall be processed as a special use under the
requirements of the village zoning ordinance. Application forms for special use
shall be provided by the village of Beach Park building department.
      2.   To encourage tower placement in commercial and industrial zoned
areas.
      3.   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers, including support structure failure and falling ice.
      4.   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers through careful design,
siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques.
      5.   To accommodate the growing need for towers.
      6.   To promote and encourage shared use/colocation of existing and new
towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use
towers, and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future.
   B.   All towers and antennas existing on the date of passage of this chapter
shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine
maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers and antennas. New
construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply
with the provisions set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.040: INDUSTRY SITE SELECTION CRITERIA:
In siting a new personal wireless service facility, the industry requires a
location that is technically compatible with the established network. A general
area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired
area of service. Specific locations within that general area will be evaluated
by the village, using the following criteria which are not listed in order of
priority:
   A.   Topography as it relates to line of sight transmissions.
   B.   Availability of road access. Access roads must remain capable of
supporting all of the emergency response equipment of the village.
   C.   Availability of electric power.
   D.   Availability of land based telephone lines or microwave link
capability.
   E.   Leasable lands; and landlords who want facilities to be located on
their properties consistent with zoning regulations.
   F.   Screening potential of existing vegetation, structures and topographic
features.
   G.   Zoning considerations.
   H.   Compatibility with adjacent land uses.
   I.   The least number of sites to cover the desired area.
   J.   The greatest amount of coverage, consistent with physical requirements.
   K.   Opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact.
   L.   Availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting.
(Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.050: VILLAGE SITE SELECTION CRITERIA:
   A.   As a fundamental element of this chapter, and in addition to the
criteria stated above, the personal wireless service provider proposing to
construct an antenna support structure, or mount an antenna on an existing
structure, is required to demonstrate, using technological evidence, that the
antenna must be placed in the approximate location which is proposed in order
to satisfy its function in the provider's grid system. Further, the provider
must demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the
minimum height with a necessary allowance for the potential colocation by other
telecommunications providers as hereinafter described, necessary to fulfill the
cell site's function within the grid system.
   B.   Consistent with providing service, personal wireless services
facilities should be located and designed to minimize any adverse effects they
may have on residential property values. Sites should be placed in locations
where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other structures
provide the greatest amount of screening. Location and design of sites should
consider the impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual
impact within the zoning district. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.060: PRIORITIES FOR LOCATION:
   A.   1. The following establishes a general order of priorities for locating
new personal wireless service facilities:
         a.   Place antennas on appropriate existing communications structures
or other appropriate existing structures.
         b.   Place antennas and towers on public property.
         c.   Place antennas and towers in districts zoned commercial or
industrial.
         d.   Place antennas and towers at locations which minimize the impact
to residential neighborhoods.
         e.   Place antennas and towers in residential districts only if
locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available in
nonresidential districts.
      2.   An applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a
residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been
made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government
structure, a private institutional structure, or other appropriate existing
structures within a nonresidential zoning district, and that due to valid
considerations including physical constraints, and economic or technological
feasibility, no other appropriate location is available. The personal wireless
services provider is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of
tall structures within a one mile radius of the site proposed, asked for
permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied for
reasons other than economic ones. The information submitted by the applicant
shall include a map of the area to be served by the tower, its relationship to
other antenna sites in the applicant's network, and an evaluation of the
suitability of existing buildings taller than forty five feet (45'),
communications towers and water tanks within one mile of the proposed tower.
   B.   1. Minimum Requirements: The placement of personal wireless service
facilities on village owned property shall comply with the following
requirements:
         a.   The applicant shall negotiate and obtain a lease or other
agreement with the village regarding such placement and shall comply with the
terms therein;
         b.   The antenna or tower will not interfere with the purpose for
which the village owned property is intended;
         c.   The antenna or tower will have minimal impact on surrounding
property;
         d.   The applicant is willing and is able to obtain adequate liability
insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation
for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards. The
compensation for the lease shall be established by the corporate authorities
after considering comparable rates in other communities, potential expenses,
and other appropriate factors;
         e.   The applicant will submit a letter of credit acceptable to the
village to cover the costs of the antenna or tower removal upon termination of
the lease;
         f.   The applicant must reimburse the village for any costs which the
village incurs by reason of the lease and the presence of the applicant's
antenna or tower; and
         g.   The applicant must obtain other land use approvals if required.
      2.   Special Prohibition: In no case shall antennas be allowed in areas
designated as conservation areas.
      3.   Application: All applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower
on village owned property must submit to the village a completed application
that complies with the submittal requirements of this chapter delineated in
section
18.04.120 of this chapter.
      4.   Reservation Of Right: Notwithstanding the above, the board of
trustees reserves the right to deny the use of any or all village owned
property by any one or all applicants. (Ord. 2001-O-10 § 1; Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.070: COLOCATION ON TOWERS:
To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers,
colocation of antennas by more than one provider on existing or new towers
shall be required rather than the construction of new single use towers as
follows:
   A.   Providers may, and are encouraged to, colocate antennas onto towers.
Provided such colocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the
policy, site criteria, landscape/screening and all other provisions contained
in this chapter, then such colocations are permitted by right and new or
additional special review approval is not required; provided, that any other
permit, license, lease, or franchise requirements must also be satisfied.
Providers shall permit the installation of public service communication
equipment on existing or new towers and antennas.
   B.   1. Unless the corporate authorities determine that colocation is not
feasible, the site plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to
be used for the placement of additional equipment or buildings for other users.
The site plan for towers in excess of one hundred feet (100') must propose
space for two (2) or more other users while the site plan for towers under one
hundred feet (100') must propose space for one other user. To provide further
incentive for colocation as a primary option, an existing tower may be modified
or reconstructed to accommodate the colocation of an additional antenna;
provided, that an application is filed and approved by the village.
      2.   Upon the approval of the village, an existing tower may be modified
or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed the height limitation for towers
and antenna as contained in the zoning ordinance, to accommodate the colocation
of an additional antenna. The height change may occur only once per tower, and
the tower as modified must comply with the other provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.080: DESIGN CRITERIA:
   A.   Towers: In order to reduce the number of antenna support structures
needed in the village in the future, any new proposed support structure shall
be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user unless the applicant
demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic, technical or
physical reasons. The village may deny the application to construct a new tower
if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an
existing structure.
      1.   Tower Design: Every new tower shall be a monopole rather than
lattice type tower, unless otherwise authorized by the corporate authorities
for good cause shown.
      2.   Setback: Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower
to the property line of the parcel on which it is located and at a minimum
shall be set back one-third (1/3) the height of the tower from the property
line unless a greater setback is required by the zoning ordinance. Towers shall
comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they are
located in all zoning districts in addition to the specific requirements for
article 6, additional requirements, contained in the zoning ordinance.
      3.   Lights, Signals And Signs: No signals, lights or signs shall be
permitted on towers unless required by the FCC or the FAA.
      4.   Tower Safety: The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed
tower is safe and the surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by
support structure failure, falling ice or other debris or interference. All
towers shall be fitted with anticlimbing devices, as approved by the
manufacturers.
      5.   Standards: To ensure the safe operation of towers, the owner of a
tower shall maintain the tower in compliance with all FCC and FAA standards and
applicable standards of any other governmental agency and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the electronic industries
association (EIA), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
village concludes that a tower fails to comply with such standards or
constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided
to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such
tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such
tower into compliance within the thirty (30) days, the village may remove such
tower at the owner's expense, or the village shall have the right to bring the
tower into compliance and the costs of which shall constitute a lien on the
property, and the village shall have the right to record and enforce the lien.
      6.   Structural Design: Towers shall be constructed to the EIA standards,
which may be amended from time to time, and all applicable construction/
building codes. Further, any improvements and/or additions to existing towers
shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional
engineer which demonstrate compliance with EIA standards and all other good
industry practices in effect at the time of said improvement or addition. The
plans shall be submitted and reviewed at the time existing building permits are
requested.
   B.   Antenna Criteria: To the extent feasible, antenna on or above a
structure shall be subject to the following:
      1.   The antenna must be architecturally compatible with the building and
wall on which it is mounted and designed and located so as to minimize any
adverse aesthetic impact.
      2.   The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna is the minimum
height required to function satisfactorily.
      3.   The antenna shall be mounted on a wall of an existing building in a
configuration as flush to the wall as technically possible and shall not
project above the wall on which it is mounted unless for technical reasons the
antenna needs to project above the wall. In no event shall an antenna project
more than fifteen feet (15') above the height of the building.
      4.   The antenna shall be constructed, painted or fully screened to match
as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which
it is mounted.
      5.   The antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical
equipment enclosure which project above the roof of the building, but may not
project any higher than fifteen feet (15') above the enclosure.
      6.   If an accessory equipment shelter is to be erected or is present,
the equipment shelter must blend to the extent practicable with the surrounding
buildings in architectural character and color. The structure must be
architecturally and visually (color, size and bulk) compatible with surrounding
existing buildings, structures and/or uses or those likely to exist under the
terms of the underlying zoning. Such facilities will be considered
architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the
facilities.
      7.   If a proposed antenna is to be located on a building or a lot
subject to a special use permit, written village approval is required prior to
the issuance of a building permit for the antenna.
      8.   No antenna shall be permitted on property designated as an
individual landmark or as a part of a historic district or site, unless such
antenna has been approved in accordance with this chapter and written
permission is obtained from the village.
      9.   On buildings forty five feet (45') or more in height, the antenna
may be mounted on the roof if:
         a.   The village finds that it is not technically possible or
aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall;
         b.   No portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of
the building to exceed the limitations set forth herein;
         c.   Roof mounted antennas are completely screened from view by
materials that are consistent and compatible with the design, color and
materials of the building;
         d.   No portion of the antenna may extend more than fifteen feet (15')
above the height of the existing building.
      10.   No antenna shall cause localized interference with the reception or
transmission of any other communications signals including, but not limited to,
public safety signals, and television and radio broadcast signals.
   C.   Facilities: Facilities should be architecturally compatible with the
surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district or otherwise
integrated, through location and design, to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
   D.   Color: Towers and antennas shall have a color generally matching the
building surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless a
different color is required by the FCC or FAA. Muted colors, earth tones and
subdued colors shall be used wherever possible. The paint on the tower shall be
properly maintained.
   E.   Equipment Structures: Ground level equipment and buildings and the
tower base shall be adequately screened. The standards for the equipment
buildings are as follows unless otherwise authorized by the corporate
authorities for good cause shown:
      1.   The maximum floor area is four hundred (400) square feet and the
maximum height is twelve feet (12'), and the structure shall be designed and
constructed so as to facilitate an adjoining equipment structure of another
provider which would abut the original equipment structure.
      2.   Ground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent properties by
landscape plantings, fencing or other appropriate means, as specified herein or
elsewhere in the village code.
      3.   Equipment mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the
exterior building walls. Equipment for roof mounted antennas may also be
located within the building on which the antennas are mounted, subject to good
engineering practices. Antennas and related equipment shall occupy no more than
twenty five percent (25%) of the total roof area of a building.
   F.   Federal Requirements: All towers and antennas must meet or exceed
current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If
such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within three (3) months
of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency.
Upon failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations, or if at any time in the future the towers or
antennas are found not to be in compliance with FCC regulations, the village
shall have the right to remove said towers and antennas at the owner's expense
at any time after sixty (60) days' certified mail, return receipt requested,
written notice to the owner at his/her last known address.
   G.   Fencing: A well constructed and approved chainlink, wood fence, stucco,
masonry or stone wall or other fencing ("fencing") not less than six feet (6')
in height from finished grade shall be provided around each tower. The type of
fencing shall be subject to review and approval of the corporate authorities.
Security fencing should be colored or should be of a design which blends into
the character of the existing environment. Access to the tower shall be through
a locked gate.
   H.   Site Location: Site location and development shall preserve the
preexisting character of the site as much as possible. Existing vegetation
should be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of
the site should be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less
visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. The effectiveness of visual
mitigation techniques must be evaluated by the village, in the village's sole
discretion, taking into consideration the site as built.
   I.   Colocation; Lease Agreements: No personal wireless service facility
owner or lessee or officer or employee thereof shall act to exclude or attempt
to exclude any other personal wireless service provider from using the same
building, structure or location. Personal wireless service facility owners or
lessees or officers or employees thereof shall cooperate in good faith to
achieve colocation of personal wireless service facilities and equipment with
other personal wireless service providers pursuant to a commercially reasonable
lease agreement. If a dispute arises about the feasibility of accommodating
another competitor, the village may require a third party technical study, at
the expense of either or both parties, to resolve the dispute.
   J.   Wind: The antennas and their support structures shall be designed to
withstand a wind force of one hundred (100) miles per hour without the use of
supporting guy wires. No guy or other support wires shall be used in connection
with such antennas or their support structures except when used to anchor the
antennas or support structures to an existing building. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.090: INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
Within thirty (30) days after a facility becomes operational, and each year
thereafter, the facility operator shall conduct a safety inspection in
accordance with FCC standards and within sixty (60) days of the inspection,
file a report with the village. However, at the option of the village, the
village may secure the services of an independent safety consultant to conduct
a safety inspection, and the owner of the facilities shall reimburse the
village for the reasonable cost of said inspection. In addition, the facility
operator shall provide the village, on a quarterly basis, a report stating the
active or inactive status of the facilities including the tower and antennas.
Additionally, in the event there are any increases to the wattage of the tower
output, the facility operator shall notify the village within five (5) business
days of any such wattage increase. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.100: LANDSCAPING/SCREENING:
   A.   Landscaping: Reasonable landscaping, as described herein, shall be
required to screen as much of the support structure as reasonable and feasible.
The fencing surrounding the support structure and any other ground level
features (such as a building), shall be designed to soften the appearance of
the facility site. The village may permit any combination of existing
vegetation, berming, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if this achieves the same objective of screening the
facility. If the antenna is mounted flush on an existing building, and all
other equipment is either housed inside an existing building or screened from
view, landscaping shall not be required, except as otherwise required by other
village code provisions.
   B.   Screening: The visual impacts of a tower in residential and adjacent to
residential areas shall be mitigated through landscaping or other screening
materials at the base of the tower and ancillary structures. The following
landscaping and buffering of towers shall be required around the perimeter of
the tower and accessory structures. Landscaping shall be installed on the
outside of fences. Further, existing vegetation shall be preserved to the
maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for or to supplement
compliance with landscaping requirements.
      1.   A row of evergreen trees a minimum of six feet (6') tall at planting
and a maximum of six feet (6') apart shall be planted around the perimeter of
the fence unless adequate landscaping or screening is in place, or the village
determines otherwise.
      2.   Owner shall maintain all fencing and landscaping including replacing
any landscaping, if necessary. If the village specifically requests the owner
to replace fencing or landscaping the owner shall promptly comply with any such
request. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.110: NONUSE/ABANDONMENT:
In the event the use of any tower or the facilities has been discontinued for a
period of sixty (60) consecutive days, the facilities shall be deemed to be
abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the
village which shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits
from the tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon such
abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional sixty
(60) days within which to:
   A.   Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/
operator who makes actual use of the tower; or
   B.   1. Dismantle and remove the facilities including, but not limited to,
the tower, storage shed, fence, driveway and all other ancillary structures and
to restore the property including the landscaping to the extent reasonably
possible to the conditions existing at the time of installation of the
facilities. If such tower is not removed within the sixty (60) days, the
village may remove such tower at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or
more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective
until all users cease using tower. Unnecessary sections of the tower shall be
removed.
      2.   At the earlier of sixty (60) days from the date of abandonment
without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, village
approval for the tower shall automatically expire. If an abandonment of a tower
occurs by all of the permittees, licensees or owner of the tower, the owner of
the tower shall remain primarily responsible if the tower ceases to be used for
its intended purposes by either it or other permittees or licensees for the
transmission or reception of personal wireless services. In the event that the
tower ceases to be licensed by the FCC for the transmission of radio energy,
the owner of the tower shall maintain the prescribed painting and/or
illumination of such tower until it is dismantled. The application for any
tower shall be accompanied by a letter of credit in an amount to be determined
by the village which may be drawn upon by the village as necessary to cover the
costs of removal of the tower as discussed in subsection B1 of this section.
(Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.120: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:

   L.   The applicant, if not the personal wireless services provider, shall
submit proof of lease agreements with an FCC licensed personal wireless
services provider, if such telecommunications provider is required to be
licensed by the FCC.
   M.   Applicants shall be required to provide evidence of liability insurance
in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) and to provide the village
evidence that the insurance is in full force and effect by an annual report.
   N.   At the time of site selection, the applicant should demonstrate how the
proposed site fits into its overall network within the village, and if the
applicant is able or unable to colocate on an existing structure. The applicant
shall submit information requested by the building and zoning officer and
corporate authorities related to the availability of suitable existing towers,
other structures or alternative technology. If the applicant believes that
colocation is unavailable to the applicant and that no reasonable alternative
technology exists to accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna, then the
applicant shall submit evidence to demonstrate that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna, and such evidence may consist of the following:
      1.   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area which meet applicant's engineering requirements.
      2.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
      3.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      4.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
      5.   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      6.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
      7.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell network
using multiple low powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wire line
system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or
antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
All pending or new applications for the siting of personal wireless service
facilities shall comply with the provisions set forth in this chapter. (Ord.
1997-O-26)
18.04.130: THIRD PARTY REVIEW:
The personal wireless services providers use various methodologies and analysis
tools, including geographically based computer software, to determine the
specific technical parameters of personal wireless services, such as expected
coverage area, antenna configuration and topographic constraints that affect
signal paths. In certain instances there may be a need for expert review by a
third party of the technical data submitted by the personal wireless services
provider. The village may require such a technical review, to be paid for by
the applicant for the personal wireless service facilities. The selection of
the third party expert may be by mutual agreement between the applicant and
village or at the discretion of the village, with a provision for the applicant
and interested parties to comment on the proposed expert and review the
qualifications. The expert review is intended to be a site specific review of
technical aspects of the personal wireless service facilities and not a
subjective review of the site selection. Such a review should address the
accuracy and completeness of the technical data, whether the analysis
techniques and methodologies are legitimate, the validity of the conclusions
and any specific technical issues outlined by the board of trustees, the
building and zoning officer, village staff, third party consultants or other
interested parties. Based on the results of the third party review, the village
may require changes to the application for the personal wireless service
facilities that comply with the recommendations of the expert. (Ord. 1997-O-26)
18.04.140: VIOLATION; PENALTY:
   A.   Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions or
terms of this chapter, upon conviction, shall be punishable by a fine not to
exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each day during which the
offense continued.
   B.   In addition to a fine, the village shall have the right to seek
injunctive relief for any and all violations of this chapter and all other
remedies provided at law or in equity. If the village prevails in any action at
law or in equity, the village shall also be entitled to recover its attorney
fees, costs and all other expenses incurred in conjunction therewith, as may be
summarily accessed and awarded by the court as part of its judgment. (Ord.
1997-O-26)
