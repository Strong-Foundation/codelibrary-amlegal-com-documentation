before the hour of 9:00 a.m. on all other days, or after the hour of 7:00 p.m.
all days.

D-1. In the case of a denial of an application based on the applicant’s
ineligibility under Paragraph E of Subsection 3-4B-3, the chief operating
officer may authorize the issuance of a permit upon presentation of evidence

trust or does not present a danger to the community, subject to whatever

believe are reasonably necessary.

AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE VILLAGE OF HAWTHORN WOODS
FIRE CODE
 
WHEREAS,   the Mayor and Board of Trustees have determined that it is in the
best interest of the Village of Hawthorn Woods (Village) to create a new
Hawthorn Woods Fire Code using the 2018 Edition of the ICC (International Code
Council) International Fire Code (“Fire Code”); and
WHEREAS,   the 2018 Edition of the ICC International Fire Code is a
comprehensive compilation of codes designed to meet the needs of local fire
jurisdictions through model code regulations that prescribe safeguards for the
safety and public health of all communities; and
WHEREAS, the ICC is a result of consolidation of three previously recognized
model code organizations: BOCA (Building Officials & Code Administrator), ICBO
(International Conference of Building Officials), and SBCCI (Southern Building
Code Congress International); and
WHEREAS, the ICC offers a complete set of codes without the regional
limitations or technological disparities of the past. These codes are fully
compatible with a larger set of codes promulgated by the ICC as well. Those
codes are the International Building Code, International Energy Conservation
Code, International Fuel Code , International Mechanical Code, International
Plumbing Codes, International Property Maintenance Code, International Private
Sewage Disposal Code, International Residential Code, International Zoning
Code, and the ICC Electrical Code; and
WHEREAS, one of the main benefits of this Fire Code is the model code
development process under which it has been designed. This offers an
international forum for the fire safety professionals to discuss and debate the
various requirements found herein. The model code system encourages
international consistency in the application of the provision within the code.

principles intended to establish provisions consistent with the scope of a
building code that adequately protects health, safety and welfare; provisions

provisions that do not give preferential treatment to particular types of
classes of materials, products or methods of construction; and

permit additional time at his or her discretion taking into account the number
of persons wishing to be heard on a matter and the amount of business requiring
attention.
      5.   Public Bodies generally do not answer questions from a speaker
during Public Comment as they may not have the ability to provide an immediate
response at the meeting. The Mayor or Chair may direct the speaker to the
appropriate village official or staff member for assistance.
      6.   Members of the public may be asked to avoid repeating comments that
have already been made, although they may be given the opportunity to indicate

When a police officer or other individual authorized to issue a code violation
finds a code violation to exist, he or she shall note the violation on a
multiple copy violation notice and report form that indicates: a) the name and
address of the defendant, b) the type and nature of the violation, c) the date
and time the violation was observed, and d) the names of witnesses to the
violation.
The violation report form shall be forwarded to the code hearing unit where a
docket number shall be stamped on all copies of the report and a hearing date
shall be noted in the blank spaces provided for that purpose on the form. The
hearing date shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days
after the violation is reported. However, if the code violation involves a
municipal ordinance regulating truants, the hearing date shall not be less than
seven (7) nor more than forty (40) days after the violation is reported.
One copy of the violation report form shall be maintained in the files of the
code hearing unit and shall be part of the record hearing, one copy of the
report form shall be returned to the individual representing the village in the
case so that he or she may prepare evidence of the code violation for
presentation at the hearing on the date indicated, and one copy of the report
form shall be served by first class mail to the defendant along with a summons

population under three million (3,000,000), if the violation report form
requires the respondent to answer within a certain amount of time, the village
must reply to the answer within the same amount of time afforded to the
respondent.
No continuances shall be authorized by the hearing officer in proceedings under

presented by an attorney designated by the village or by any other village
employee, except that the case for the village shall not be presented by an

the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or
her control.
      2.   In the case of an automated traffic law violation, a technician
employed or contracted by the Village must determine, based on inspection of
recorded images, that the subject vehicle was being operated in violation of
section 11-208.6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or in violation of this code. If
the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of
a funeral procession or in order to yield the right of way to an emergency

program, or to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear
at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified will result in a
final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the

final determination of violation liability for the failure and the exhaustion
of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for
review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty,
or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the Village.

automated traffic law violation liability must be sent following a final
determination of parking, standing, compliance, or automated traffic law
violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures, which
notice must contain, but is not limited to, the following information:

unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the village; and

within the time specified may result in the Village’s filing of a petition in
the circuit court to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid
fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment, or may result in suspension of
the person’s driver’s license for failure to pay fines or penalties for ten
(10) or more parking violations under section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code or five (5) or more automated traffic law violations under section 11-
208.6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

may submit an affidavit to the court or Hearing Officer swearing that, at the
time of the alleged violation, the vehicle was in the custody and control of
another person. The affidavit must identify the person in custody and control
of the vehicle, including the person’s name and current address. The person in
custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation is required to
complete the required traffic education program. If the person in custody and

traffic education program, the registered owner of the vehicle is not required
to complete a traffic education program.

law violations and violations concerning the standing, parking, or condition of
vehicles:
      1.   Final Disposition: Payment of the indicated fine, and any applicable
penalty for late payment, and completion of any required traffic education
program and payment of any applicable penalty for late completion thereof,

liability occurs following failure to complete the required traffic education
program, to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a Hearing Officer’s

exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by this Chapter.

Illinois administrative review law1.
(Ord. 1289-09, 8-17-2009; amd. Ord. 2436-25, 2-24-2025)

sanction, or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the
failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois administrative
review law are a debt due and owing the village and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law.

administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code
violation, the village may commence a proceeding in the circuit court for the
purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision, and order. Nothing
in this section shall prevent the village from consolidating multiple findings,
decisions, and orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon commencement
of the action, the village shall file a certified copy of the findings,
decision, and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites
facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision, and order was issued in

an opportunity for a hearing under this chapter and for judicial review as
provided in this chapter:

requested by the village to enforce the order of the hearing officer to correct
a code violation.

authorized to cooperate with county, state and federal governments and with
other municipalities and political subdivisions in all matters pertaining to
emergency management operations defined in this chapter.
   C.   In performing the duties under this chapter, the village mayor is
further authorized: (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000; amd. Ord. 1125-05, 5-16-2005)
      1.   To make, amend and rescind all lawful necessary orders, rules and

appropriated for such purposes, to procure and preposition supplies, medicines,
materials and equipment to institute training programs and public information
programs, and to take all other preparatory steps, including the partial or
full mobilization of emergency management organizations in advance of actual
disaster to ensure the furnishing of adequately trained and equipped forces for
disaster operations.
      3.   Out of funds appropriated for such purposes, to make such studies
and surveys of the industries, resources and facilities in this village as may
be necessary to ascertain the capabilities of the village for the emergency
management phases of mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery, and to
plan for the most efficient emergency use thereof. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000)
   D.   The village mayor is authorized to designate space in a village
building, or elsewhere for the Hawthorn Woods emergency management agency as
its office.
   E.   The village mayor shall annually notify the Illinois emergency
management agency of the manner in which the village is providing or securing
emergency management, identify the coordinator and furnish additional
information relating thereto as the Illinois emergency management agency
requires. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000; amd. Ord. 1125-05, 5-16-2005)
2-9-6: FINANCING:
   A.   It is the intent of the village board and declared to be the policy of
the village that every effort shall be made to provide funds for disaster
emergencies. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000)
   B.   It is the village board's intent that the first recourse shall be to
funds regularly appropriated to the Hawthorn Woods emergency management agency.
If the village mayor finds that the demands placed upon these funds in coping
with a particular disaster are unreasonably great, and, the governor has
proclaimed the village a disaster, the village mayor may make application for
funds from the state disaster relief fund. If monies available from the fund
are insufficient, and if the village mayor finds that other sources of money to
cope with the disaster are not available or are insufficient, the village mayor
may issue a call for an immediate session of the village board for the purpose
of enacting ordinances as the board may deem necessary to transfer and expend
monies appropriated for other purposes, to borrow monies from the United States
government or other public or private sources. If less than a quorum of the
members of the board is capable of convening in session to enact such
ordinances for the transfer, expenditure or loan of such monies, the village
mayor is authorized to carry out those decisions until such time as a quorum of
the board can convene. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000; amd. Ord. 1125-05, 5-16-2005)

disasters. If a disaster occurs, the village may exercise the powers vested
under this chapter in the light of the exigencies of the disaster and,
excepting mandatory constitutional requirements, without regard to the
procedures and formalities normally prescribed by law pertaining to the
performance of public work, entering into contracts, the incurring of
obligations, the employment of temporary workers, the rental of equipment, the
purchase of supplies and materials, and the appropriation, expenditure, and
disposition of public funds and property. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000)
   D.   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit the
village mayor's authority to apply for, administer and expend grants, gifts, or
payments in aid of disaster prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response or
recovery. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000; amd. Ord. 1125-05, 5-16-2005)

operations plans and to authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance
thereunder. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000)
   C.   During a local disaster, the village mayor may suspend the provisions
of any village ordinance prescribing procedures for the conduct of village
business, or the orders, rules and regulations of any village agency, if strict
compliance with the provisions of any ordinance, rule or regulation would in
any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency,
as authorized by the "Illinois emergency management agency act", provided that,
if the village board meets at such time, the village mayor shall act subject to
the directions and restrictions imposed by the body. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000;

dealt with unassisted. The mutual aid shall not, however, be effective unless
and until approved by each of such political subdivisions, municipal
corporations or bodies of politic as are parties thereto, in the manner
provided by law, and unless and until filed with and approved in writing by the
director of the Illinois emergency management agency. Such arrangements shall
be consistent with the state and local emergency management operations plan and
program, and in the event of such a "disaster" as defined in this chapter, it

agency shall evaluate the possibility of multi-purpose use thereof for general
village purposes. The agency shall make recommendations to the village mayor as
appropriate. (Ord. 893-00, 3-13-2000; amd. Ord. 1125-05, 5-16-2005)

If such "disaster" as defined in this chapter occurs in this village and the
services of persons who are competent to practice any profession, trade or
occupation are required in this village to cope with the disaster situation and
it appears that the number of persons licensed or registered in this village to
practice such profession, trade or occupation may be insufficient for such

tree, trees or dead wood within thirty (30) days after the aforesaid notice is
so served, the building inspector shall proceed to remove or have same removed
and duly destroyed, and to collect from the property owner the reasonable cost
thereof. This cost is a lien upon the real estate affected superior to all
other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided, that notice has been
given as herein described; and expense is incurred and the village or person
performing the service by authority of the village in his or its own name,
files notice of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds of Lake County. The
notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out: a) a description of the
real estate sufficient for identification thereof, b) the amount of money
representing the cost and expense incurred or payable for the service, and c)

or occupant of any dwelling, building or structure which is built after the
effective date of this section and that is adjacent to any public water supply
system or public sewer collection system, or later becomes adjacent to any
public water supply system or public sewer collection system, to cause such
premises to be connected to such system. No building or development permit
shall be issued for any such dwelling, building or structure unless provisions
have been made for such connection, and no certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for any such dwelling, building or structure until after such
connections have been made properly. All nonresidential connections to the
public water supply system shall be at least two inches (2") in diameter. Water
system connections for every unit within a multiple-unit development shall be
individually metered.
For purposes of this chapter: 1) "public water supply system" shall be defined
as any system owned and operated by a municipality, a county or by a utility
company regulated by the Illinois commerce commission, 2) "multiple-unit
development" shall include, without limitation, structures for townhouses,
condominiums, multiple-family dwellings and industrial or commercial multiple-
unit buildings, and 3) "public sewer collection system" shall be defined as any
system owned and operated by a municipality, a county or by a utility company
regulated by the Illinois commerce commission.
   C.   Adjacent Premises: For purposes of this section, premises shall be
deemed to be adjacent to such public water supply system or a public sewer
collection system where a water or sewer main is located in a public right of
way or easement contiguous to such premises and said water main or sewer main
extends along the entire frontage of such premises. Further, premises shall not
be deemed to be adjacent to such water or sewer system where connection to such
system would require tunneling or boring for a distance of greater than two
hundred feet (200') under any roadway, building or flowing stream.
   D.   Application For Connection: No person shall make any connection to such
public water supply system or public sewer collection system without first
having filed an application for and obtained a permit from the village, and, if
applicable, the governmental unit or utility company which owns such system.
All connections shall be made in full compliance with all applicable statutes,
codes, ordinances, agreements, rules and regulations of any governmental unit
having jurisdiction over the premises. (Ord. 1092-04, 12-20-2004)

from the regulations imposed under this chapter. An application for a variation
shall be filed with the chief operating officer, and shall identify the
specific unique circumstances affecting the subject property and the specific
detriment which would result in the absence of the requested variation. The
chief operating officer shall promptly review each application and forward the
same, along with recommendations thereon, to the board of trustees. No
variation shall be granted unless unique circumstances affecting the subject
property, not of the property owner's creation, would result in some
substantial detriment in the absence of the requested variation, nor shall a
variation be granted if any material detriment to the public health, safety or
welfare would result therefrom. Financial hardship shall not constitute unique
circumstances or a substantial detriment for the purposes of this subsection.
The board of trustees may impose such conditions or restrictions upon the grant
of any variation as may be necessary or appropriate to further the purpose and
intent of the connection requirements of this section. (Ord. 1092-04, 12-20-

4-5-7: SEWER CHARGES:
   A.   Hawthorn Woods: Certain areas of the village are provided sanitary
sewer service through the Village of Hawthorn Woods’ own sewer system. Subject
to the provisions of this section, the following charges shall apply for
sanitary sewer services provided by the Village to residents of the Village:
      1.   Effective October 1, 2015, every resident user of sewer service from
a Village of Hawthorn Woods’ owned sewer system shall pay six dollars ($6.00)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons or fraction thereof of all metered water
consumption for operation, maintenance and replacement costs. This rate will
automatically adjust each January 1st, commencing with January 1, 2017, based
on the actual State of Illinois Department of Revenue CPI index. This index is
used by the State of Illinois in the calculation of the PTELL property tax cap
limitation calculation. Notwithstanding, any imposed annual increase will have
a 2% floor and a 4% ceiling.
      2.   Summer Capped Usage Calculation - Single Family Residential Users
ONLY: During the months of November through April, sewer volumetric charges
will be billed based on the actual water usage as measured by the Aqua Illinois
water meter. During the months of December through March, the Village will
calculate a four (4) month average “measured flow” water usage in order to
determine the “summer” capped sewer usage to be applied during the summer
months May through October. The lesser of the (1) actual water usage or (2) the
average usage of the “measured flow” period will be utilized to bill the
“summer” month’s sewer volumetric charges. The specific dates will vary based
upon actual meter read dates, but will generally fall within the months
mentioned above. For new customers without the minimum four (4) months of usage
history available to establish a measured average flow amount, sewer volumetric
charges will be based upon the lesser of (1) actual water usage or (2) a
default value of 3,000 gallons per month until four (4) months of actual usage
is compiled during the December through March measuring period. Each summer
capped consumption amount is assigned to the property for the customer that
established the value and it does not transfer with a customer to another
premise.
   B.   Lake Zurich: Certain areas of the village are provided sanitary sewer
service via connection to the sewer system of the Village of Lake Zurich,
pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement with the Village of Hawthorn Woods
dated August 4, 2003, as may be amended from time to time. In addition to the
connection charges set forth in section
4-5-6 of this chapter, customers connecting to such system shall be subject to
the terms and provisions of said Lake Zurich agreement. Pursuant to the Lake
Zurich agreement, the Village of Hawthorn Woods is responsible for billing for
such service. In such case, the following additional charges shall apply:
      1.   Connection Charges: Prior to connection to the system, each customer
shall pay the connection charges that apply to users of the Lake Zurich sewer
system located outside Lake Zurich’s corporate limits, as such charges may be
amended from time to time.
      2.   Basic Charge: Each customer shall pay the basic user fee charged to
users located outside Lake Zurich’s corporate limits, subject to adjustment as
set forth in subsection 3 of this section.
      3.   Automatic Adjustment Of Basic Charge: The basic charge established
in subsection 2 of this section includes the charge assessed to the Village of
Lake Zurich by the County of Lake for sewage treatment services provided by the
County of Lake. The basic charge also includes the charge assessed to the
Village of Hawthorn Woods by the Village of Lake Zurich for providing sewer
service to the Village of Hawthorn Woods. The basic charge established in
subsection B of this section shall be adjusted automatically to reflect any
increase in the charges by either the County of Lake or the Village of Lake
Zurich.
      4.   Additional Charges: Prior to connection to the system, each customer
shall pay an administrative reservation fee of one hundred twenty dollars
($120.00) per population equivalent (“PE”). In addition, prior to connection to
the system, each customer shall pay an advance user fee in the amount of twenty
dollars ($20.00) per PE or two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00),
whichever is greater. For purposes of calculating the amount due under this
subsection, a residential user shall be presumed to use 3.5 PE. A
nonresidential user shall be presumed to use such number of PE as the village
engineer approves, upon review of the proposed use of the property.
      5.   Inspection Fee: An inspection fee of seventy five dollars ($75.00)
per hour shall be charged for the review and inspection of the sanitary sewer
facilities of each customer who desires to connect to the system. Such fee
shall be paid and such review and inspection shall be conducted and Lake
Zurich’s approval of said facilities shall be made prior to the connection.

be waived at the discretion of the Chief Financial Officer, not to exceed one
occurrence per customer per calendar year.
      2.   Lien Procedure: Charges for sewer service may be a lien on the
premises to the extent permitted by statute. Whenever a bill for sewer service
remains unpaid sixty (60) days after it has been rendered, such charges shall
be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent, and the Village Clerk may
file with the recorder of deeds of Lake County a statement of lien claim. If a
lien is filed, the following procedure shall be followed: The statement of lien
shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the
unpaid bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as
well as for all charges for sewer service subsequent to the period covered by
the bill. The Village Clerk shall mail a notice to the owner of the premises
stating payment is delinquent and a lien has been filed. Failure of the Village
Clerk to record such lien or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner
to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of the lien or the right
to foreclose the lien for unpaid sewer bills as provided in this subsection.
      3.   Property Sold For Nonpayment: Property subject to a lien for unpaid
sewer charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of
such sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting the costs, as is
the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. The village attorney shall be
authorized to institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any
court having jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which the
sewer bill has remained unpaid thirty (30) days after it has been rendered.
      4.   Village Right; Collection of Delinquent Service Charges: The village
shall have the right to pursue any and all legal means of collecting delinquent
service charges, whether by collection service or other method, regardless of
whether a lien for such charges has been filed. (Ord. 1092-04, 12-20-2004; amd.

SMOKE FREE AIR REGULATIONS
SECTION:
4-8-1: Findings
4-8-2: Purpose
4-8-3: Definitions
4-8-4: Prohibition In Enclosed Public Places
4-8-5: Prohibition In Certain Unenclosed Public Places
4-8-6: Prohibition In Places Of Employment
4-8-7: Prohibition In Open Air Dining Areas
4-8-8: Prohibition At Public Entrances
4-8-9: Designation Of Other No Smoking Areas
4-8-10: No Retaliation
4-8-11: Signs
4-8-12: Penalties
4-8-1: FINDINGS:
Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the
environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that
may result from the incendiary nature of such activity. It has been determined
that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers.
Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered
hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide
and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68 percent of the total smoke produced by a
cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with respiratory
tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative
reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material and
direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and property of
residents of the village and the public, it is necessary and desirable to
establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in
all places of employment, near entrances to all such public places and places
of employment, in and near open air public dining areas and outdoor venues, and
within certain unenclosed public places including school grounds and parks.
(Ord. 1188-06, 10-23-2006, eff. 1-1-2007)
4-8-2: PURPOSE:
This chapter may be cited as the HAWTHORN WOODS SMOKE FREE AIR ORDINANCE, the
purpose of which is to protect the public health, comfort and environment by
prohibiting smoking in all enclosed public places and places of employment,
within fifteen feet (15') of all public entrances to such places, in open air
public dining areas and outdoor venues and within fifteen feet (15') of such
areas, and within certain unenclosed public places including school grounds and
parks in order to ensure that nonsmokers may breathe air free from the
hazardous effects of secondhand smoke. (Ord. 1596-15, 9-21-2015)

   The American Public Health Association has recognized homelessness as a
public health issue, since research shows that homeless individuals (1) suffer
"higher mortality rates and chromic disease loads" than non-homeless
populations; (2) "overuse emergency services, leading to higher costs for
treatment" for all persons; and (3) with no form of shelter "can exacerbate
conditions such as diabetes and hepatitis C". The U.S. Interagency Council on
Homelessness has noted that people "who experience homelessness die nearly 30
years earlier than the average American-and often from easily treatable
illnesses.

found to be engaging in public camping from removing their personal property
from the campsite; however, such personal property that constitutes exempt
personal property and which a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer,
exercising the applicable constitutional standard, would conclude that said
exempt personal property constitutes items appearing to be stolen or otherwise

the Bus to a facility approved by the Police Department. Any police officer
shall have the authority to refuse to allow any and all passengers from
disembarking the bus and shall escort the bus out of our corporate limits.
Upon the towing of a Bus, the police officer shall notify or make a reasonable
attempt to notify the owner of record, lessee, person claiming to be the owner
or lessee, or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle
owner's right to request an administrative hearing. (Ord. 2302-24, 1-8-2024)
5-7-8: ADMINISTRATIVE TOW HEARING:
Within five (5) business days after a Bus is seized and impounded, the Village

owner of record, lessee, and any lienholder of recorder of the owner's right to
request a hearing to determine whether a violation of this

vehicle is registered as shown on the records of the State in which the vehicle
is registered shall be conclusive evidence of the name and address of the owner
of record of the vehicle, unless the owner of record gave the Village actual
written notice of a different name or address.
In order to obtain a hearing, the owner of record must file a written request
for a hearing with the Village Clerk or the Police Department no later than ten
(10) business days after the date the notice was mailed. The hearing date must
be scheduled for a date that is no more than fifteen (15) business days after a

witness and documentary evidence; and the right to cross-examine all witnesses.
If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a preponderance of
evidence, that a violation of this
Chapter 5-7  has occurred involving the seized and impounded Bus, then the
hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle
liable to the Village for the administrative fees of seven hundred and fifty
dollars ($750.00), which shall be in addition to any other penalties, fines and
remedy sought. If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine, by
a preponderance of the evidence, that the vehicle was used in violation of
Chapter 5-7  of this Code, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for
the owner and ordering the return of the vehicle.
If the owner of record fails to request a hearing on the seizure and
impoundment of the Bus in a timely manner or fails to appear at the hearing,
the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived the owner's right to a
hearing, and the hearing officer may enter a default order in favor of the
Village in the amount of the administrative fees. However, if the owner of
record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default
order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing
and signs a written waiver, in which case, an order of liability shall be
deemed to have been made when the Village receives the written waiver. (Ord.

6-2-2: VEHICLE WEIGHT RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Definitions: For purposes of this section, the following definitions
apply:
    LIMITED CONTINUOUS USE MOVEMENTS: Movements generally to one site over a
period of three (3) months made by oversized vehicles which do not exceed the
weight limits set forth in subsection B of this section. Limited continuous use
permits may be issued for up to ten (10) trips, generally to the same site
during the time period allowed.
   MULTIPLE MOVEMENTS: Those movements by a single permittee involving trips in
close proximity to each other in distance and in time. The village's police
department may, in its sole discretion, consider such multiple movements under
a single permit. Such a multiple move permit, when granted by the police
department, may not exceed a thirty (30) day period of time. The precise routes
and times must be identified prior to obtaining a permit.
   ONE-WAY OR SINGLE TRIP MOVEMENT: One move from the point of origin to the
point of destination. Stops between the point of origin and the point of
destination are expressly prohibited. Single trip permits are effective for
five (5) consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed
by the Hawthorn Woods police department.
   ROUND TRIP MOVEMENT: A trip from point of origin to the point of destination
and back to point of origin over the same route. Round trip permits are
effective for ten (10) consecutive days from the date of issuance.
   B.   Permits Required:
      1.   A permit issued by the village shall be required for the movement of
any vehicle on a roadway or bridge owned and maintained by the village which
exceed the following limits:
         a.   Maximum gross weight of more than six (6) tons.
         b.   Maximum length of more than fifty five feet (55').
         c.   Maximum width of more than eight feet (8').
         d.   Maximum height of more than thirteen feet six inches (13'6").
This shall apply to any single vehicle or series of vehicles pulled by a single
tractor. With respect to those roadways and bridges under construction, road
closures with or without signage do not exempt overweight and/or oversized
movements from permit requirements when any traffic is allowed through
construction zone(s) and when the movement is made by applicant(s) not
performing construction on the roadway closed. In an emergency declared by
resolution of the village, the requirements to obtain permits may be waived.
      2.   The following are exempt from permits:
         a.   Fire department vehicles;
         b.   Vehicles operating under an emergency declaration;
         c.   Village owned vehicles;
         d.   Vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair;
         e.   Equipment used for snow and ice removal, owned or operated by any
governmental body;
         f.   Refuse trucks (state nondesignated highway weight limits apply);

that operates the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement.
      4.   Permits for vehicles that are both overweight and oversized are
valid only one-half (1/2) hour before sunrise until one-half (1/2) hour after
sunset, on any day for which the permit is valid.
      5.   Permits are nontransferable and apply only to the permittee.
      6.   The village may issue revisions to permits:
         a.   To correct an error attributed to the village;
         b.   To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered
before the move; or
         c.   To adjust weights, dimension or routes as issued on the permit,
before the move is made.
Any revisions made at the request of the permittee for purposes of changing
weights, dimensions, routes or load description shall be made before any move
is made at a cost of twenty dollars ($20.00) per permit.
      7.   The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the
permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take
place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the
village's police department any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either
the village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is
prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms.
      8.   The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of
the authority granted by the permit for the use of village roads, and any
vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and
without a permit. Permits shall be in the driver's possession at all times
unless otherwise directed in writing by the village's police department and
presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of
inspection.
      9.   If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the
proper utilities notified, property moved, bridges or highways analyses
performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. Any associated cost
shall be the responsibility of the permittee.
      10.   All movements under the permit shall be made in accordance with all
applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
      11.   Permits are void if altered by the permittee. The permits issued
under this subsection constitute the grant of a privilege by the village and
may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the village may deem related to
its governmental interests including, but not limited to:
         a.   A permittee's knowingly providing incorrect information in an
application for a permit;
         b.   A permittee, its agents, or employees acting on a permit which
has been altered for purposes of deception;
         c.   Noncompliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal,
state, or local ordinances pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of
a vehicle engaged in the transport of goods; or
         d.   Moving on village streets without a valid permit as required
under this subsection.
   C.   Applications For Permit:

      2.   Applications for a permit to move an oversized and/or overweight

(24) hours prior to the move.
   D.   Police Escorts: Police escorts shall be required for certain vehicles
and loads as determined by the village's police department. The total number of
officers necessary to provide for a safe move shall be determined by the
village's police department. Fees for escorts shall be in addition to any
permit fees.
Fees for the escort shall be seventy five dollars ($75.00) per hour per officer
assigned with a minimum of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), irrespective of
the time or number of officers actually used.
   E.   Bonds, Indemnification And Insurance:
      1.   The permittee shall assume total liability for any and all damages
to streets, bridges, village owned appurtenances and private or public property
while engaged in a move. The measure of liability shall be the actual cost for
all repairs or replacement of property damaged by the permittee.
      2.   The permittee shall indemnify and hold harmless the village from any
costs, judgments or settlements, including attorney fees, arising from physical
injuries, including loss of life, or damage to or loss of property related to
acts or omissions by permittee, its officers, agents, or employees pursuant to
the permit.
      3.   Upon application for a permit(s) for loads over seventy three
thousand two hundred eighty (73,280) pounds, each applicant shall provide
evidence of a valid comprehensive general liability insurance policy for
protection against personal injury or property damage in the amount of one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence. Such coverage shall be placed
with a responsible company acceptable to the village, licensed to do business
in the state of Illinois, and with a minimum insurance rating of A:VII as found
in the current edition of "A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide". Each policy shall
bear an endorsement precluding the cancellation or reduction of said policies
without providing the village at least thirty (30) days' prior notice thereof
in writing. All required insurance shall be maintained by the contractor in
full force and effect during the life of the move.
   F.   Suspension And Reinstatement:
      1.   Suspension of a current permit, as authorized by subsection B11 of
this section, shall be for the time determined appropriate by the village's
police department. Reinstatement may be made upon conditions determined by the
police department and payment of all outstanding fees.
      2.   In addition to any other fees and costs pursuant to subsection F1 of
this section, there shall be a reinstatement fee of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      3.   The chief of police or his or her designee shall administer and
enforce this section and shall have the authority to grant, deny, suspend or
reinstate permits. Any applicant or permittee denied a permit or who has had a
permit suspended, upon request, shall have the right to appeal the action to
the chief of police or his or her designee.

devices within five hundred feet (500') of signs within a construction or
maintenance zone indicating such zone, as defined in this section, nor shall
evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding

processing costs associated with the prosecution of an offender or the removal,
impoundment, storage and release of the vehicle. If an administrative fee is
imposed pursuant to this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt due and

until the administrative fee and all applicable towing and storage charges are
paid to the village, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to

7-2-5: CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES ON RIGHTS-OF-WAY:
   A.   Purpose and Scope.
      1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
      2.   Intent. In enacting this section, the village intends to exercise
its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use
of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards
to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without
limitation:
         a.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places; and
         b.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and
other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic; and
         c.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property; and
         d.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities; and
         e.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures
and materials that increase impermeable surfaces; and
         f.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities
are installed; and
         g.   Preserve open space; and
         h.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
         i.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
      3.   Facilities Subject to This Section. This section applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this section may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
      4.   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this section.
      5.   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
         a.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
         b.   Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with,
or inconsistency between, the provisions of this section and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      6.   Conflicts with Other Provisions of the Village Code. This section
supersedes all other provisions of the village code, or parts thereof, adopted
prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, but only to the extent of such
conflict.
      7.   Conflicts with state and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable
Federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
section, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this section to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
      8.   Sound Engineering Judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this section and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this section when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

11-1-1H1d of this code plus reimbursement, per applicable draw down deposit
agreement, for all village staff and technical consultant costs incurred by the
village in reviewing said application.
   E.   Action on Permit Applications.
      1.   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit
applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
Director within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the Director shall reject such application in writing, stating
the reasons therefor. If the Director is satisfied that the proposed work
conforms to the requirements of this section and all other applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director shall issue a
permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty
of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the
construction proposed under the application is in full compliance with the
requirements of this section.
      2.   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
         a.   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/
4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this section for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the Facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than twenty-five (25) days prior
to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director shall specify
the portion of the Right-of-way upon which the facility shall be placed, used
and constructed.
         b.    In the event that the Director fails to provide such
specification of location to the Telecommunications Retailer within either:
            (1)   Ten (10) days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction; or
            (2)   Twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the
Telecommunications Retailer in the case of work involving Excavation for new
Construction, the Telecommunications Retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this Section.
         c.   Upon the provision of foregoing specification by the village,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to this section, the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an application for a
permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of this section.
      3.   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a Utility that is a Holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq.) shall be deemed
granted forty-five (45) days after submission to the village, unless otherwise
acted upon by the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable
village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
   F.   Effect of Permit.
      1.   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit issued by the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this section on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
      2.   Duration. No permit issued under this section shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually commenced
within said period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
      3.   Pre-Construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this section prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
      4.   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
   G.   Revised Permit Drawings. In the event that the actual locations of any
facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this section, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with this section. If the
village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it
conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.
   H.   Insurance.
      1.   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by
franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way
or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (a) and (b) below:
         a.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            (1)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
            (2)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
            (3)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
         b.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with
a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
         c.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
         d.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
      If the Utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with the foregoing.
      2.   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
      3.   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
      4.   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance
policies required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
         “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Village, by registered mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to cancel
or not to renew.”
      Within ten (10) days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
      5.   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by Subsection (H)(1) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds, or the requirements of Subsections 2-4 of this section. A utility
that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and
limit requirements required herein, such as evidence that the utility is a
"private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.
      6.   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
      7.   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
   I.   Indemnification. By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-
of-way, a utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit and/or defense, arising out of, resulting
from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or
wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing
or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this section or by a franchise, license,
or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity
obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
negligence, misconduct or breach of this section by the village, its officials,
officers, employees, agents or representatives.
   J.   Security.
      1.   Purpose. The Permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the Permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
         a.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this section;
         b.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this section; and
         c.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this section including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this section to perform and that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this section and any other applicable law.
      2.   Form. The Permittee shall provide the security fund to the village
in the form, at the Permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
         a.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior written notice
to the village and the permittee;
         b.   Not require the consent of the Permittee prior to the collection
by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
         c.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
      3.   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient
to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the director, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection for any single phase.
      4.   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice stating the reason for, and its intention to, exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the Permittee:
         a.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         b.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         c.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
         d.   Fails to comply with any provision of this section that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.
      5.    Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount required
herein.
      6.   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the
village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that
any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required herein.
      7   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
section or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
      8.   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect
to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village,
whether reserved by this section or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
   K.   Permit Suspension and Revocation.
      1.    Village Right to Revoke Permit. The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this section for one or more of the following
reasons:
         a.   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
         b.   Non-compliance with this section;
         c.   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or
welfare; or
         d.   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
      2.   Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
section stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to the Permittee as set forth in Subparagraph 3, herein.
      3.   Permittee alternatives upon receipt of notice of revocation or
suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the Permittee shall have the following options:
         a.   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
         b.   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five (5) business days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
         c.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such removal to
the village within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
      The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this Subsection.
      4.    Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of
revocation or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately
upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth herein.
      5.    Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the Permittee
fails to comply with the provisions of this Section, the Village or its
designee may, at the option of the Village:
         a.   Correct the deficiencies;
         b.   Upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to the Permittee,
remove the subject facilities or equipment; or
         c.   After not less than thirty (30) days notice to the Permittee of
failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
village. The Permittee shall be liable in all events to the village for all
costs of removal.
   L.   Change of Ownership or Owner's Identity or Legal Status.
      1.   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this section, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
      2.   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village's right-
of-way.
      3.   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding
must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
   M.   General Construction Standards.
      1.   Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from
time to time:
         a.   Standard specifications for road and bridge construction;
         b.   Supplemental specifications and recurring special provisions;

         h.   Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight Maintenance Operations.
      2.   Interpretation of Municipal Standards and Principles. If a
discrepancy exists between or among differing principles and standards required
by this section, the Director shall determine, in the exercise of sound
engineering judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be final.
If requested, the Director shall state which standard or principle will apply
to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the future.
   N.   Traffic Control.
      1.   Minimum Requirements. The village's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices and this Code.
      2.   Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers. The utility is
responsible for providing and installing warning signs, protective devices and
flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable Federal, state, and local
requirements for protection of the public and the utility's workers when
performing any work on the rights-of-way.
      3.   Interference with Traffic. All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
      4.   Notice When Access is Blocked. At least forty-eight (48) hours prior
to beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any
residence, business or institution, the Utility shall notify the resident,
business or institution of the approximate beginning time and duration of such
work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to
this section, the utility shall provide such notice as is practicable under the
circumstances.
      5.    Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the village.
   O.   Location of Facilities.
      1.   General Requirements. In addition to location requirements
applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities,
regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of
this subsection.
         a.   No Interference with Village Facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Director determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the village's
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
         b.   Minimum Interference and Impact. The proposed location shall
cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way
and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with
the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-
of-way.
         c.   No Interference with Travel. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
         d.   No Limitations on Visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
         e.   Size of Utility Facilities. The proposed installation shall use
the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals,
and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for
the particular application.   
         f.   Exclusive Conduit. No permittee shall insert any wire, cable,
conduit or pipe through an existing conduit that traverses under the roadway or
right-of-way such as a storm sewer. All utilities' facilities must be in its
own exclusive conduit unless prior permission of the other utility or the
Director of Public Works is obtained.
      2.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways.
         a.   Overhead Parallel Facilities. An overhead parallel facility may
be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
            (1)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
            (2)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet behind the face of the curb,
where available;
            (3)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet outside the outer
shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
            (4)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
            (5)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot of
the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
         b.   Underground Parallel Facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
            (1)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight (8) feet from and parallel to the right-of-
way line;
            (2)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
            (3)   In the case of an underground power or communications line,
the facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and
not more than five (5) feet from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot of the right-of-way line or as
near as practicable.
      3.   Facilities Crossing Highways.
         a.   No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
         b.   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
         c.   Ninety Degree (90°) Crossing Required. Crossing facilities shall
cross at or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as
practicable.
         d.   Overhead Power or Communication Facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
            (1)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
            (2)   Poles are located within one foot of the right-of-way line of
the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
            (3)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
         e.   Underground Power or Communication Facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
            (1)   The design materials and Construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
            (2)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs
is provided in the initial installation.
         f.   Markers. The Village may require the Utility to provide a marker
at each Right-of-Way line where an underground Facility other than a power or
communication Facility crosses a Highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of Facility, the Utility, and an Emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 C.F.R. §192.707
(1989)).
      4.   Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The
village may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way
that are not highways, rather than within particular highways.
      5.   Freestanding Facilities.
         a.   The village may restrict the location and size of any
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way.
         b.   The village may require any freestanding facility located within
a right-of-way to be screened from view.
      6.   Facilities Installed Above Ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
         a.   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
         b.   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
         c.   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
      7.   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
         a.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or Roadway
structures only where the Utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
         b.    A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
            (1)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
            (2)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the
highway structure in the transportation system;
            (3)   The alternative routings available to the Utility and their
comparative practicability;
            (4)   The proposed method of attachment;
            (5)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of
the proposed facility;
            (6)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and
painting;
            (7)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
            (8)   The public benefit expected from the Utility service as
compared to the risk involved.
      8.   Appearance Standards.
         a.   The Village may prohibit the installation of Facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
         b.   A Facility may be Constructed only if its Construction does not

right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
         b.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify
the Director or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
village police shall be notified immediately.

more of the provisions of this section must do so in writing to the Director as
a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of
this section from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance
should be granted.
      2.   Authority to Grant Variances. The Director shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this section identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
      3.   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Director may authorize a
variance only if the Utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
         a.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
         b.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
      4.   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director may require the utility requesting the
variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this section but which carry out the purposes of the
same.
      5.   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
under the provisions of this section shall have the right to appeal to the
Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate. The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk
within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal
at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting, but in no event earlier than

decide the appeal.
   V.   Penalties. Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or
refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this Section shall be subject
to a fine in accordance with Section
1-4-1 of this code. There may be times when the village incurs delay or other
costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot
perform its duties under its permit and this section.
   Unless the utility demonstrates that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs and/or damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a
permit related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon
a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
   W.   Enforcement. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting any
additional or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of
this section. (Ord. 1771-17, 6-26-2017; amd. Ord. 1796-17, 12-13-2017; Ord.

applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure, unless the provider of the first
completed and accepted application tolls its application as described in the
permit required subsection of this section (Division C.2.d.Tolling).
            (2)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the Village fails to
approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days after the submission of
a completed application.
            However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
seventy-five (75) days after the submission of a completed application.
            The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the ninetieth
(90th) day after submission of the complete application or the tenth (10th) day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of
the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the Village's denial of the
permit request within the time limits as provided under this section.
            (3)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the Village fails to approve or

activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application.
            The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day after submission of the complete application or
the tenth (10th) day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the
Village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the
Village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under
this section.
            (4)   The Village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this section.
            If the Village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or
regulations that concern public safety, or the Collocation Requirements and
Conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
Village denies an application.
            The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village
and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty
(30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed
approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days
of denial shall require the application to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the Village's review period.
            The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
            (5)   Pole Attachment Agreement. Within thirty (30) days after an
approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility
pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment
Agreement, a form of the agreement is attached as Exhibit A to Ord, 1863-18,
provided by the Village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole
by the application. Such agreement may be approved administratively by the
Village's Chief Operating Officer (COO) or designee unless the COO or designee
decides to place the approval of said supplemental agreement with the Corporate
Authorities at the next available Village Board meeting. For subsequent
approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal
utility pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a License
Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement that may be approved
administratively by the Village's Chief Operating Officer (COO) or designee
unless the COO or designee.
         c.   Completeness of Application. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving an application, the Village shall determine whether the application
is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the
Village must specifically identify the missing information. An application
shall be deemed complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the
applicant within thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees
specifically enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted
by the applicant to the Village.
      Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
         d.   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled
by:
            (1)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
            (2)   A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
         e.   Consolidated Applications. An applicant seeking to collocate
small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be
allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and
receive a single permit for the collocation of up to twenty-five (25) small
wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same
type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
         If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the
Village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application
and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
         f.   Duration of Permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a
period of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for
equivalent durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless
facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the
applicable Village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained
in this section.
         If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable Village code provisions or

      3.   Collocation Requirements and Conditions.
         a.   Public Safety Space Reservation. The Village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
         b.   Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall
install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe
condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and
conditions of this section. The wireless provider shall ensure that its
employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small
wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all
applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations.
         c.   No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
         A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency's communications equipment.
         Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy
the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
         d.   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
         However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
         e.   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
         f.   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a Village
ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive plan or other
written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way,
including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
         g.   Alternate Placements. Except as provided in this Collocation
Requirements and Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
(100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
         If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
         h.   Height Limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless
facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless
support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
         New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            (1)   Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility
pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in
place on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located
within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or
wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
            (2)   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
         i.   Height Exceptions or Variations. If an applicant proposes a
height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations
on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variation in conformance with procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in Section 4 of this section.
         i.   Contractual Design Requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and
a private property owner that concern design or construction standards
applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of-way.
         j.   Ground-mounted Equipment Spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variation and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variations.
         k.   Undergrounding Regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
         l.   Collocation Completion Deadline. Collocation for which a permit
is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit,
unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a
delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack
of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of
the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time
to complete installation does not exceed three hundred and sixty (360) days
after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the
Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
      4.   Application Fees. Application fees are imposed in accordance with
Section
11-1-1 of the Village Code and as follows:
         a.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local

continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. Within
thirty (30) days of a facility becoming inoperable, the owner of the facility
shall notify the Village in writing that such facility is no longer
operational. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility
within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village
notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment.
      The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its Pole Attachment Agreement for municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
      A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it
sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the

   D.   Variations.
      1.   Request For Variation: A utility requesting a variation from one or
more of the provisions of this Section must do so in writing to the Director of
Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this Section from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
      2.   Authority To Grant Variations: The Village shall decide whether a
variation is authorized for each provision of this Section identified in the
variation request on an individual basis.
      3.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Director of Public Works
may authorize a variation only if the utility requesting the variation has
demonstrated that:
         a.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
         b.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variation is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
      4.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variation: As a condition
for authorizing a variation, the Director of Public Works may require the
utility requesting the variation to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this Section but which carry
out the purposes of this Section.
      5.   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this Section shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Board or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the Village Board's next regularly scheduled
meeting occurring at least seven (7) business days after the filing of the
appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the appeal.
   E.   Dispute Resolution. The Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois shall
have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small
Wireless Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning
rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles
within the right-of-way, the Village shall allow the collocating person to
collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than two hundred dollars
($200) per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon
final resolution of the dispute.
   F.   Indemnification. A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the
Village harmless against any and all liability or loss from personal injury or
property damage resulting from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use
or occupancy of the Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this section and the
Act.
   A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against
any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of
the Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive
any claims that they may have against the Village with respect to
consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
   G.   Insurance. The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless
provider's own cost and expense, the following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
      The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured
on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and
documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
      A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this
section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 1863-18, 7-23-

guarantee the completion of public improvements may not be reduced or partially
discharged prior to completion and issuance of each certificate of occupancy
for covered residential dwelling units; that is, all certificates of occupancy

be entitled to interest on such cash deposit. Should such public property and
improvements be damaged in any way, the building inspector shall notify the
applicant and the applicant shall have fourteen (14) calendar days in which to
repair the same. If the applicant fails to make such necessary repairs within
said time, the building inspector is directed to have the necessary repairs
made and the costs paid from the cash or surety bond. The balance of the cash
or surety bond, if any, shall be returned to the applicant. Should the cash or
surety bond be insufficient to pay the full amount of the costs, the applicant
shall promptly reimburse the Village, upon demand, for such additional costs.

occupancy of the premises will not, in the opinion of the Chief Operating
Officer, present a hazard to the occupants. Both the owner and any contractor
must sign any application for a temporary certificate of occupancy. In
addition, prior to the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy the
owner and contractor must execute an agreement, acceptable in form to the
Village Attorney, providing as follows:
         a.   That all corrections indicated on the final inspection check
sheet shall be completed within six (6) months of the issuance of the temporary
certificate of occupancy;
         b.   That reinspection of the subject premises shall be permitted
within the six (6) month period in order to verify the corrections;
         c.   That failure to make the corrections within the six (6) month
period shall be cause for the Village to record the final inspection check
sheet with the Recorder of Deeds of Lake County, Illinois;
         d.   That the owner and contractor shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Village, its officers, agents and employees from any and all
claims, losses or damages which may be incurred by reason of occupancy of the

been fully completed so as to comply with all applicable Village ordinances at
the end of the six (6) month period, the owner and contractor agree that the
Village may cause said premises to be vacated and to remain vacated until full
compliance with all applicable ordinances of the Village has been obtained.
During the time period of the temporary certificate of occupancy, all cash
bonds and/or letters of credit required in connection with the issuance of the
building permit will be held by the Village. Failure to complete all items on
the final inspection check sheet may cause the forfeiture of any or all cash
bond or letter of credit with respect to said structure and the Village may
record said final inspection check sheet with the Recorder of Deeds for Lake
County, Illinois. The Village has the right, but not the obligation, to utilize
the cash bond or letter of credit posted hereunder to cause the completion of
any remaining items necessary to obtain a permanent certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. 1642-16, 3-21-2016)

(Ord. 381-87, 6-9-1987)
9-3-14: SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PWS FACILITIES:
Personal wireless service (PWS) facilities shall not be installed, constructed
or altered without first obtaining a building permit from the village. The
regulations set forth in this section shall govern the installation of PWS
facilities (including all collocation of such facilities on existing
facilities), in addition to all other applicable provisions of this code.
Applications for a building permit to construct PWS facilities shall be
referred to the building department for review.
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for the installation
of PWS facilities and minimize the total number of PWS facilities throughout
the village; encourage owners and operator of PWS facilities to locate them, to
the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the village is
minimized; encourage owners and operators of PWS facilities to configure them
in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the PWS facilities; and to
comply with the requirements of federal law.
   B.   Use Provisions/Location: PWS facilities (specifically includes no
impact facilities without PWS towers) complying with the requirements of this
section may be installed on lots in the M or I district as a special use.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village may permit as a special use in any
zoning district, PWS facilities when specifically located along existing
overhead electrical high tension transmission lines or railroad tracks. Where
there are existing PWS facilities located in any zoning district, collocation
may be considered by a special use permit.
PWS facilities may be installed on zoning lots along with existing principal
structures or uses. Lawfully constructed PWS facilities shall not be deemed to
be either principal or accessory structures or uses, but shall be permitted
additional structures. Such PWS facilities shall be included for the purpose of
determining maximum lot coverage for the zoning lots so occupied.
   C.   Standards For Construction Of PWS Facilities: PWS facilities may be
installed on lots as provided in this section, in accordance with the
following:
      1.   Collocation: In order to minimize adverse visual impacts associated
with the proliferation of PWS facilities, collocation of PWS facilities by more
than one carrier on existing or new PWS facilities or other structures shall
take precedence over the construction of new single use PWS facilities. The
village may deny an application for special use permit or building permit to
construct a new PWS facility if the applicant has not made a good faith effort
to collocate the PWS facility on an existing PWS facility or other structure in
accordance with the provisions of this section. If a new PWS facility is deemed
to be necessary, then it shall be designed and constructed to accommodate more
than one user, and shall include appropriate provision for the PWS facilities
of such additional users.
      2.   Exceptions: No new PWS facility shall be permitted unless the
applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the village that no
existing PWS facility or other structure can accommodate the applicant's
proposed PWS facility. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing PWS
facility or other structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed PWS
facility may consist of any of the following:
         a.   No existing PWS facility or other usable structures are located
within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering
requirements.
         b.   Existing PWS facilities and other structures are not of
sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements and cannot
be adapted or retrofitted to meet those requirements.
         c.   Existing PWS facilities and other structures do not have
sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's PWS antenna and
related equipment.
         d.   The applicant's proposed PWS facility would cause unavoidable
electromagnetic interference with an antenna or other facility on the existing
PWS facility or other structures, or an antenna or other facility on the
existing PWS facilities or other structures would cause unavoidable
electromagnetic interference with the applicant's proposed PWS facilities.
         e.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing PWS facilities and other structures unsuitable or
unusable.
      3.   Type And Finish: Each PWS facility shall be aesthetically designed
to blend in with the character of the site or be aesthetically camouflaged,
such as designed to look like a pine tree, for example. Each PWS facility
design shall be maintenance free. The design and finish shall be approved by
the village board.
      4.   Structural Attachment: Each PWS tower shall be roof mounted (i.e.,
structurally attached to the roof of a building), freestanding (i.e.,
structurally attached to the ground), or mounted to high tension towers.
      5.   Installation And Maintenance: Each PWS facility shall be installed
and maintained in accordance with all applicable local, state, and federal
laws, including those of the FAA and the FCC, and the village's building
regulations.
      6.   Security: Each PWS facility shall be equipped with an appropriate
anticlimbing device or devices; and shall feature security wall and/or other
appropriate security measures as detailed in subsection D2 of this section.
      7.   Number Of Towers: Not more than one freestanding PWS facility shall
be installed on any zoning lot without a variance and special use.
      8.   Lighting: No PWS facility shall be artificially illuminated unless
such is required by the FAA or other regulatory agency having jurisdiction in
which case, such artificial illumination shall be limited to that which is so
required.
      9.   Setbacks: Each freestanding PWS facility shall comply with all
required setbacks for the zoning district in which such are located and
further, shall be set back from any residential lot line a distance of not less
than the height of the tower. Setbacks shall be measured from the nearest
property line or street right of way to the base of the PWS facility.
      10.   Distance Between Towers: No freestanding PWS tower shall be
installed less than five hundred feet (500') from any other freestanding PWS
tower.
      11.   Height For Roof Mounted Towers: No PWS facility installed by
structural attachment to a roof mounted PWS tower or directly to a building
shall overhang or project more than twenty four inches (24") beyond the plane
of any exterior wall of such building. No PWS facility installed by direct
structural attachment to an existing structure shall exceed a total height of
ten feet (10') above the height of such structure.
      12.   Height For Freestanding Towers: No freestanding PWS towers shall
exceed a total height of twenty feet (20') above the zoning district's maximum
building height, and no roof mounted PWS tower shall exceed a total height of
twenty feet (20') above the height of the building to which it is attached,
both as measured from grade to the highest point of the tower, including the
height of any antennas attached thereto, unless the applicant can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the planning, building and zoning commission that more
height is physically necessary in order to permit the provision of personal
wireless services and no alternative location or locations exist which would
permit the provision of personal wireless services without a tower of such
height in which case, the tower shall not exceed the minimum height necessary
to provide personal wireless services.
   D.   Aesthetics, Screening, And Wall: PWS facilities shall be designed so as
to be aesthetically compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses in
the area in which they are located, to the extent practical, in accordance with
the following:

establishing minimum requirements for the off street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put. (Ord. 381-87, 6-9-1987)
9-11-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS, PARKING AND LOADING:
   A.   Scope Of Regulations: The off street parking and loading provisions of
this title shall apply as follows:
      1.   Applicability: For all buildings and structures erected and all uses
of land established after the effective date of this title, accessory parking
and loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this title, and provided
that construction is begun within one year of such effective date, and
diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities as required
hereinafter need not be provided.
      2.   Intensity Of Use Increased:
         a.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities are required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
         b.   However, no building or structure lawfully erected or use
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this title shall be
required to provide such additional parking or loading facilities unless and
until the aggregate increase in units of measurement existing upon the
effective date of this title, in which event parking or loading facilities as
required herein shall be provided for the total increase.
      3.   Change Of Existing Use: Whenever the existing use of a building or
structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading
facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. However, if the said
building or structure was erected prior to the effective date of this title,
additional parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by
which the requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use
if the latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of this title.
   B.   Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Accessory off street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served which were in existence on the effective date of this title or were
provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced
below or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below the
requirements of this title for a similar new building or use.
   C.   Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: Nothing in this title shall
be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings; provided,
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   D.   Damage Or Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this title,
which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off
street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time
of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation.
However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or
loading facilities in excess of those required by this title for equivalent new
uses or construction.
   E.   Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No off site parking lot shall
change ownership from that of the zoning lot on which the building or use
served by such facility is located. No such off site parking facilities shall
be authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where the plans call for
parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the Plan
Commission 1  has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and made findings
that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the site of the
parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the off site
parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the
proposed use or building. (Ord. 381-87, 6-9-1987)
   F.   Submission Of Plot Plan: Any application for a building permit or for
an occupancy certificate shall include therewith a plot plan (drawn to scale
and fully dimensioned) showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided
in compliance with this title. (Ord. 1190-06, 11-20-2006)

owner of the proposed use, or through consultation with consultants or other
communities containing uses similar to the one proposed, or through a
combination of these methods.
   C.   Shopping Centers: Drive-through facilities adjacent to or integrated in
a shopping center or cluster of commercial facilities shall use the common
access with other business establishments in that center.
   D.   Drive-Through Aisles:
      1.   Each drive-through entrance/exit shall be located so that, when in
use, they do not obstruct ingress or egress to the site and do not obstruct
access to required parking or loading spaces.

clearly designated by signs and pavement markings.
      3.   Area for drive-through aisles shall be separated with landscaping

with low shrubs that screens the drive-through aisles from the adjacent public
right of way and neighboring properties shall be used to minimize the visual
impact of any permitted sign. At no time shall this landscape barrier be pruned
in a manner that allows the vehicle headlights from the drive-through lane to
be visible from abutting street right of way or from neighboring properties.
Plantings should also be designed to discourage potential safety issues.
   F.   Pedestrian Access And Crossings: Pedestrian walkways should not
intersect the drive-through drive aisles, but where they do the walkways shall

(50) decibels and at no time shall any speaker system be audible above daytime
ambient noise levels beyond the property lines of the site. The speaker system

9-14-3: Initiation
9-14-4: Processing
9-14-5: Decisions
9-14-1: PURPOSE:
The development and execution of this title is based upon the division of the
village into districts, within any one of which the use of land and buildings
and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to the land,
are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses
which, because of their unique character cannot be properly classified in any
particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the
impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the public need for the
particular use or the particular location. Such special uses fall into the
following categories:
   A.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities, or
uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
   B.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities. (Ord. 381-87, 6-9-1987)
9-14-2: AUTHORITY:
Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the village board in accordance
with the provisions of this title applicable to amendments of this title and
the regulations and conditions set forth in this title for special uses. No
application for a special use shall be acted upon by the village board until
after:
   A.   A written report is prepared and forwarded to the village board by the
plan commission in a manner prescribed herein for amendments to this title; and
   B.   A public hearing has been held by the plan commission after due notice
by publication as prescribed herein, for amendments, and the findings and
recommendations of the plan commission 1  have been reported to the village
board. At the time of the filing of an application for any special use, the
applicant shall furnish to the village clerk a complete list containing the
names and addresses of those persons to whom were sent the tax bills for the
general taxes for the last preceding year on all property located within two
hundred fifty feet (250') in each direction of the location for which the
special use is requested; provided, the number of feet occupied by all public
roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall be excluded in computing the
two hundred fifty feet (250') requirement. The plan commission shall hear no
special use application unless the applicant furnishes such information. The
village clerk shall, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15)
days before the hearing at which the special use is to be considered, send
written notice to the persons whose names appear on the list furnished by the
applicant. (Ord. 381-87, 6-9-1987)
   C.   Notwithstanding any provision contained in this title to the contrary,
to hear applications for and thereafter submit reports of findings and

shall be final and subject to judicial review only in accordance with
applicable statutes of the State.
   E.   Standards:
      1.   The Board of Trustees of the Village shall not vary the provisions
of this Title as authorized in this Section, unless it shall have made findings
based on the evidence presented to it and the Zoning Board of Appeals in the
following cases:
         a.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;

         c.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      2.   A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the judgment
of the Village Board, sustains each of the three (3) conditions enumerated
above.
      3.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Zoning
Board of Appeals and the Board of Trustees, in making this determination
whenever there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, shall also
take into consideration the extent to which the following facts, favorable to
the applicant, have been established by the evidence:
         a.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved will bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out;
         b.   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is
based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoned
classification;
         c.   That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or,
         f.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      4.   The Zoning Board of Appeals and Village Board may require such
conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may
be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this Section to reduce
or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this Title.
   F.   Authorized Variation: Variations from the regulations of this Title

(90%) of the required area and width. The percentage set forth in this
subsection is not to be reduced by any other percentage for minimum lot width
and area set forth in this Title;

9-17-2: PURPOSE:
The natural character of the Village and its environs consist of gently rolling
and undulating fields interspersed with numerous wetlands and upland forest
groves. In a portion of the community there also exists remnant riparian and
lake margin forests which to a large extent have been disturbed over the years
resulting in successional plant growth such as common box elder and European
buckthorn competing with willows, ash, and soft maples. Coincidentally, box
elder and buckthorn are two (2) species often found invading vacant fields and
mature forest. The focus of this Chapter is on the wooded and created
environments of the Village and its environs so as to minimize disturbance and
to enhance the natural character of the Village as it develops and changes
pursuant to the Village Comprehensive Plan. Through careful planning and
creative design numerous benefits as stated below will be achieved:
   A.   Preservation in as far as practical, the existing natural vegetation of
the region;
   B.   Preservation to the greatest degree practical of significant trees
located around the periphery of properties and to a limited reasonable extent
the preservation of trees located internal to properties;
   C.   Preservation and creation of natural landscapes;
   D.   Aid in the stabilization of soil by the prevention of soil erosion and
sedimentation;
   E.   Reduction of storm water runoff and the cost associated therewith and
replenishment of ground water supplies;
   F.   Aid in the generation of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere;
   G.   Provision of a visual and acoustical buffer between differing land
uses;
   H.   Provision of protection against severe weather;
   I.   Aid in the control of drainage and restoration of denuded soil
subsequent to construction or grading;
   J.   Provision of a habitat and food source for birds, which will assist in
the control of insects;
   K.   Protection of property values;
   L.   Conservation and enhancement of the Village's physical and aesthetic
environment, especially its natural and semi-rural atmosphere;

         b.   Ornamental understory trees which are not acceptable for use as a
replacement tree are as follows:
 
Common Name  Scientific Name
Osage-orange Maclura pomifera
Buckthorn    Rhamnus cathartica
 
         c.   Replacement ornamental understory trees shall have a minimum
caliper of two inches (2") or a minimum height of six feet (6') if
multistemmed.
         d.   The required number of equivalent replacement ornamental
understory trees shall be computed on the following basis:
Two (2) replacement ornamental understory trees = one replacement shade/canopy
tree.
      3.   Equivalent Replacement Evergreen Trees:
         a.   For the purposes of this chapter the following tree species are
designated as equivalent replacement evergreen trees:
Common Name  Scientific Name
Fir, douglas Pseudotsuga menziesii

shall be computed on the following basis:
            One and one-half (1.5) replacement evergreen trees between six (6)
and eight feet (8') in height = One replacement shade/canopy tree
               or,
            One replacement evergreen tree eight feet (8') and over in height =
One replacement shade/canopy tree.
   C.   Tree Replacement Schedule:
      1.   Protected trees removed subject to the provisions of this Chapter
shall be replaced according to the following schedule:
 
Diameter Of Removed Trees Required Replacement  Shade/Canopy Trees
6–9 inches              2
10–12 inches            4
13–15 inches            6
16–20 inches            8
21–25 inches            9
26 or more inches         11
 
      2.   The size of required replacement shade/canopy trees and number and
size of equivalent replacement ornamental/understory and evergreen trees shall
be as set out in subsection B of this Section. Trees measured in any fraction
shall be rounded to the next highest whole number for the purposes of
determining the number of required replacement trees.
      3.   The total number of required replacement trees may be less than that
required in the tree replacement schedule provided that the total caliper of
all combined replacement trees is equal to or greater than that which would be
required by the strict application of the tree replacement schedule. For
example, the removal of two (2) protected trees each with a DBH of twelve
inches (12") requires eight (8) replacement shade/canopy trees or equivalent
with a minimum diameter of three inches (3") pursuant to subsection B of this
Section. The total caliper of the required replacement trees is therefore
twenty four inches (24"). The Village may instead permit four (4) shade/canopy
trees to be planted each with a diameter of six inches (6").
      4.   At least sixty percent (60%) of required replacement trees shall be
selected from the replacement tree list of the category of tree or trees being
removed. For example, the removal of two (2) protected ten (10) to twelve inch
(12") caliper diameter trees requires eight (8) replacement trees or equivalent
trees. At least five (5) of the replacement trees must be comprised of shade/
canopy trees and the remainder of the required plantings may be made up of
either or both ornamental understory or evergreen trees.
      5.   The Village may authorize the applicant to plant fewer trees than
required by the tree replacement schedule, as long as such replacement is in
keeping with good forestry practices as determined by the Plan Commission,
under the following circumstances:
         a.   There is not sufficient space available on the subject property
to plant the number of replacement trees required by this Chapter; or
         b.   Due to a catastrophic loss or natural disaster, the number of
replacement trees required by this Chapter would cause undue financial hardship
to the owner of the subject property.
      6.   The applicant shall not be required to replace protected trees
removed under the following circumstances:
         a.   Trees that have died as the result of natural causes, disease,
virus, infestation or act of God. The applicant shall notify the Village in
writing of the dead tree or trees and the Village shall have adequate time, but
no longer than seven (7) business days after receipt of the notification, to
verify the death of the tree or trees.
         b.   Trees that need to be culled, pursuant to proper forestry
practice, in order to prolong and enhance the lives of surrounding trees. The
applicant must submit a written statement or plan prepared by a qualified
landscape architect or urban forester detailing that culling is necessary to
maintain and prolong the life of the applicant's existing trees.
         c.   Trees required to be removed for the construction of a house.
      7.   Trees required to be planted according to the Village's Subdivision
Control Ordinance, or Section
9-17-6 of this Chapter shall not be considered replacement trees. However, the
Plan Commission may allow credit for the preservation of existing trees on the
subject site toward meeting the landscape planting requirements of the
Village's Subdivision Control Ordinance and Section
9-17-6 of this Chapter, as well as credit for increasing the minimum size of
required trees.
      8.   Where an applicant seeks to move an existing tree from its location
to another location on the subject site, and make provisions for proper tree
location and planting practices, the Village shall not require additional
replacement tree plantings for said relocated tree, provided that the applicant
demonstrates a reasonable probability that the said tree shall survive. (Ord.
802-97, 8-11-1997)
9-17-6: LANDSCAPE PLAN AND PLANTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability: A "landscape plan" shall be filed with the Village at
the time of filing of an application for a building permit for any project that
requires an application under the Architectural Review Commission provisions of

for review shall be prepared by a qualified landscape architect, be of the same
scale as the site plan and/or preliminary plat, and shall contain or have
attached to it the following information:
      1.   A scale, date and north arrow.
      2.   Name and address of the applicant and the name of the project.
      3.   Name, address, telephone number and qualifications of the person
preparing the plan.
      4.   The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures,
parking lots and drives, roadways and rights-of-way, sidewalks, bicycle paths,
ground signs and refuse disposal areas, and, any other proposed improvements to
the site.
      5.   To the extent known, the location and dimensions of all existing and
proposed structures, parking lots and drives, roadways, and rights-of-way,
sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs and refuse disposal areas, and, any
other pertinent information for the adequate consideration of the plan by the
Village on property adjacent to the subject site.
      6.   The location, quantity, size and species (both common and scientific
names) of all proposed plant materials including ground cover.
      7.   Existing and proposed topography with contours at one foot (1')
intervals.
      8.   Elevations, location and description of construction materials of
all buildings and other forms of enclosure on the property.
      9.   A full description of the manner in which existing trees that will
be preserved (if any) and site will be protected during construction.
      10.   Such other data and/or information as the Village Planner/Landscape
Architect and the Village Engineer may reasonably deem necessary to permit full
and fair consideration of the landscape plan.
   D.   Landscape Planting Requirements:
      1.   Single-family homes that require a permit from the Architectural
Review Commission shall comply with the landscaping provisions as established
by the Architectural Review Commission.
      2.   For all other development one shade/canopy tree a minimum caliper of
three inches (3") or equivalent substitute plantings shall be provided on the
lot for every one thousand (1,000) square feet of required open space on any
development lot as required in the Village Zoning Ordinance for the Zoning
District in which the subject lot is located. Such required landscape planting
shall not apply to interior open space areas devoted to athletic fields,
agricultural fields, septic fields and similar interior open space uses that
may limit interior landscaping opportunities. For the purposes of this Section,
the minimum number and size equivalent substitute plantings shall be computed
on the following basis:
         a.   Equivalent ornamental/understory trees shall have a minimum
diameter of two inches (2") or a minimum height of six feet (6') if multi-
stemmed.
            Two (2) ornamental shade/canopy trees = One shade/canopy tree.
         b.   Equivalent evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet (6') in
height.
            The required number of equivalent evergreen trees shall be computed
on the following basis:

                  or,
               One evergreen tree eight feet (8') and over in height = One
shade/canopy tree.
         c.   Eight (8) evergreen shrubs at least two feet (2') in height = One
shade/canopy tree
            Ten (10) deciduous shrubs at least three feet (3') in height = One
shade/canopy tree
            Fifteen (15) flowering shrubs at least two feet (2') in diameter/
height = One shade/canopy tree.
         d.   Five hundred (500) square feet of ground cover tree = One shade/
canopy tree.

be contained in the Village's approved landscape planting list as set out in
subsection E of this Section.
      4.   No more than ten percent (10%) of the required plantings shall be
comprised of equivalent substitute ground cover plantings.
      5.   Larger shade/canopy trees may be substituted for the minimum caliper
of three inches (3") provided that the total caliper of all combined required
shade/canopy tree plantings is equal to or greater than that which would be
required by the strict application of the minimum shade/canopy planting
requirements of this subsection. For example, two (2) required three inch (3")

of lots, blocks and streets. Dimensions of all lots shall be shown, but may be
approximated. It is the intent of this title that the concept plan need not be
done in precisely engineered plans but only in sufficient detail to permit
planning review. At this stage, the subdivider should expect that the plan
commission may require major alterations to be made in the plat if it is found
necessary.
      2.   It is not necessary that the concept plan be prepared by and sealed
by a registered land surveyor; provided, however, that the outside dimensions
of the plat shall be based upon an accurate boundary survey prepared by a
registered land surveyor.
   D.   Concept Plan Review:
      1.   The village planner shall provide the applicant with a written
review of the concept plan.
      2.   Copies of the written review of the concept plan shall be forwarded
to the village board of trustees.
   E.   Concept Plan Not Mandatory: The concept plan provided for in this
section is provided as a convenience to the subdivider and is not mandatory. As
such, should a subdivider elect to present a concept plan, such election shall
not be deemed to cause the commencement of the statutory time limitations set
forth in 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8. (Ord. 439-89, 12-11-1989;
amd. Ord. 823-98, 5-11-1998; Ord. 1629-16, 2-22-2016; Ord. 1972-19, 9-23-2019)

      2.   After final plat approval, but prior to construction activity, the
owner or subdivider shall submit a guarantee security in accordance with
subsection A2a of this section, naming the village as beneficiary thereto from
a sound and reputable banking institution, savings and loan association, surety
or insurance company, authorized to do business in this state, and deemed good
and sufficient by the village, in a form acceptable to the village attorney.
The cost of improvements shall be in accordance with cost estimates prepared by
the subdivider at his expense by a registered professional engineer and
approved by the village engineer.
         a.   Guarantee Security:
            (1)   A corporate surety bond or other financing surety submitted
in accordance with this section to guarantee the completion of public
improvements shall be in an amount equal to or greater than one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the estimated cost of installing and constructing said public
improvements, including labor and material required for the work, whether by
subcontractor or otherwise, and shall provide as follows:
               (A)   An expiration date not less than one year from the date of
issuance and an express provision that such surety or bond will not expire
prior to completion and village board acceptance of said public improvements;
               (B)   That written notice shall be given by certified or
registered mail to the village clerk of the expiration date, if any, of the
surety bond not less than sixty (60) days before said expiration, and that the
surety or bond shall not expire absent such notice;

section and the amount of such discharge or reduction;
               (G)   That the issuing institution will pay all attorney fees
and other costs reasonably incurred in enforcing collection of such financing
surety in the event that the issuer wrongfully fails to honor the village's
demand for payment under the terms of such surety or bond.
            (2)   The requirements of subsection A2a(1) of this section may be
modified or waived upon motion, resolution or ordinance of the village board if
the board first determines that the requirements of said subsection A.2.a.(1)
of this section would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the subdivider and
that the absence of a surety or bond submitted in accordance with said
subsection will not materially affect the guarantee that the requirements of
this title will be met.
            (3)   A subdivider may, at its option, submit separate sureties or
bonds for each public improvement to be accepted.
            (4)   A surety or bond submitted in accordance with this section to

extent that it would cause the balance of funds remaining to be less than one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost of work, labor, and material
remaining to be performed or provided in order to complete such improvements;
               (C)   A partial reduction or discharge of such financing surety
may be approved upon the chief operating officer's recommendation to the
village board; provided, however, such certificate shall not be construed as
partial or complete acceptance of the improvement for which said work was
performed or labor and materials provided.
            (6)   When the subdivider has supplied all of the documents or
materials required by this title to be submitted in support of its request for
discharge of a surety or bond or acceptance of the public improvement as
completed, the village board shall approve or disapprove such request within
sixty (60) days of the subdivider's application. If the subdivider's
application is disapproved, a written statement of the reasons for such
disapproval shall be given to the subdivider. The subdivider and the village
board may mutually agree to extend the sixty (60) day period. In addition, the
sixty (60) day period shall be extended as necessary in the event that weather
prevents the village from verifying the facts contained in the subdivider's
application.
            (7)   A surety or bond submitted in accordance with this section
shall be discharged upon acceptance by the village board of all improvements
for which said surety or bond was submitted and submission of a maintenance
bond guaranteeing said improvement against defects in materials or workmanship
in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the estimated cost of said improvement to
be effective for a period of one year from the date of acceptance in order to
assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements for a period of
one year after the date of their acceptance by the village board. The
maintenance bond shall continue in effect for good cause shown in writing by
the village beyond the maintenance period and until the village staff shall
verify that condition of the improvements is satisfactory and recommend release
of the maintenance bond.
            (8)   Upon acceptance of all public improvements or approval of a
partial reduction or discharge of such a surety or bond, the village clerk
shall send a written certificate within three (3) days after the next
succeeding village board meeting to the issuing institution and to the
subdivider that such financing surety may be discharged or partially reduced
and the amount of such discharge or reduction, said surety or bond to otherwise
remain in full force and effect.
            (9)   This section shall be binding upon and applicable to all
subdividers, developers and successors in title of property which is subdivided
or platted in accordance with this title.
   B.   Compliance Required Before Sale Of Lots: No owner, or agent of the
owner, of any parcel of land located in a proposed subdivision shall transfer
or sell such parcel before the final plat of said subdivision has been approved
by the village board, in accordance with the provisions of this title, and
filed with the recorder of deeds of Lake County, Illinois.
   C.   Compliance Required Before Issuance Of Building Permits: No building
permits shall be issued until the chief operating officer has notified the
village board that the final plat has been recorded, that the improvements of
the entire plat have been installed, inspected and approved in writing by the
village engineer up to, but not including, the bituminous surface course and
subsequent required items, and that the construction of the subdivision has
complied with the requirements of this code. (Ord. 1645-16, 3-21-2016; amd.

Ord. 1972-19, 9-26-2019)
10-3-4: BLOCKS:
   A.   Configuration Of Blocks: The shape of blocks shall be determined by
topographical features, the basic street system and traffic pattern, lot depths
and areas designated for public and other nonresidential land uses. In addition
to these, the lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due
regard to:
      1.   Site Adequacy: Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the
special needs of the type of use contemplated.

such facilities. (Ord. 439-89, 12-11-1989; amd. Ord. 1972-19, 9-26-2019)
10-3-5: LOTS:
   A.   Configuration Of Lots: The lot size, width, depth, shape and
orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for
the type of development and use contemplated and, in general, lots should be as
nearly rectangular in shape as practicable.
      1.   Conformance With Zoning Regulations: Width and area of lots shall
conform with lot width and area requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance
of the village1 or that of Lake County in the unincorporated areas beyond the
village limits. Corner lots shall be increased in width by twenty percent (20%)

undivided ownership or in manufacturing and business subdivisions when
specifically recommended by the plan commission and approved by the village
board.
   E.   Lot Size: Lots shall comply with the minimum lot size requirements of
the applicable zoning district classification for the property being
subdivided.
      In addition, newly created lots shall further comply with the following:
      1.   Newly created lots shall contain no area of lake, pond, wetland or
designated stormwater detention areas or similar areas, unless recommended by
the plan commission and approved by the village board.
      2.   Newly created lots must be served by sanitary sewer service or be
demonstrated to be suitable for accommodating a private individual sewage
disposal (septic) system as governed by the environmental regulations for
septic systems as adopted by the Lake County health department.
   F.   Lots Abutting A Watercourse: Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream shall have an additional depth or width as recommended by the
plan commission and approved by the board of trustees in order to provide
acceptable building sites.
   G.   Preservation Of Natural Features: In the subdividing of any land, due
regard shall be given to the preservation of natural features, such as trees,
watercourses, historical landmarks, wetlands and similar community assets,
which, if preserved, would add to the attractiveness and value of the
subdivision, neighborhood or the community as a whole. The plan commission
shall include in its report its conclusions as to compliance herewith.
   H.   Natural Features: Wetlands, lakes, ponds, detention areas and similar
natural features shall comply with the following:
      1.   Such areas shall be located on separate outlots, unless otherwise

declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, in a form approved by
the village, shall be recorded along with the final plat of subdivision and
shall include the responsibility to maintain such areas.
      3.   Such areas shall be subject to a backup special service area in the
event the homeowners' association fails to properly maintain such areas. Prior
to recording a final plat of subdivision, the applicant shall submit a consent
to the special service area signed by all owners of the property. In addition,
the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions applicable to the
property shall include an acknowledgment of the backup special service area.
(Ord. 439-89, 12-11-1989; amd. Ord. 1255-08, 6-16-2008; Ord. 1972-19, 9-23-
2019)
10-3-6: BUILDING SETBACK LINES:
Building setback lines in all new subdivisions shall conform to the front, side
or rear yard provisions of the village zoning ordinance (title 9 of this code).
(Ord. 439-89, 12-11-1989; Ord. 1972-19, 9-23-2019)
10-3-7: PARKS, SCHOOL SITES AND PUBLIC AREAS:
   A.   Depiction And Configuration: Whenever required by this title or any
other ordinance of the village, park sites, school sites and other public areas
shall be shown on all plans and plats and shall be of such configuration as to
be acceptable to the plan commission and village board.
   B.   Dedication Of Park Lands, Or Cash Contribution In Lieu Thereof: As a
condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plan and
plat of a planned unit development or any other development of land
(hereinafter referred to as a development), each subdivider or developer
(hereinafter referred to as a developer) will be required to: dedicate land for
park and recreational purposes, including, but not by way of imitation, bike/
walking paths/trails, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents
or occupants of the development; make a cash contribution in lieu thereof; or
some combination of both, at the option of the village. Unless otherwise
provided in the resolution or ordinance approving such final plat or final plan
and plat or other instrument granting final development approval, such
dedication and/or contribution shall be due as a precondition to such approval.
Such dedications and/or contributions shall be in accordance with the following
criteria:
      1.   Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreation Land Dedication:
         a.   Requirements And Population Ratio: The ultimate population of a
proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total land dedication requirement shall be one and one-half
(1.5) acres of land per one hundred (100) people. The required one and one-half
(1.5) acres may be allocated by the village board, in its discretion, based
upon the following criteria:
 
Park Classification Park Size             Minimum Acreage Per 100 People
Neighborhood parks  Not less than 5 acres 0.5 acres
Community parks     More than 20 acres    1.0 acres
Total                                     1.5 acres
 
      The ultimate population of a proposed development shall be calculated in
accordance with subsection B3 of this section.
         b.   Location: The comprehensive plan and/or the standards adopted by
the village shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. If a public school
site is located within a development, a park site adjoining the school site
shall be required. A central location which will serve equally the entire
development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be
located throughout the development according to established standards for park
area distances.
         c.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When
developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it
may have the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational
services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and
recreational area in developments may, at the sole option of the village board,
be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public"
open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the village board, based
upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park
and recreation land for the general area.
         In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks
will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his
obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of
facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village, and before any
credit is given for private recreation areas, the developer shall guarantee
that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use
by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private "swimming clubs"
are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas
is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication
that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development
and then subtract the credit to be given.
      2.   Criteria For Requiring A Cash Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites:
The village shall require the developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of
or in combination with the land dedication required when so determined by the
village board. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land
dedication shall be held in trust by the village, solely for the acquisition,
maintenance, and/or improvement of park and recreation land as herein
classified, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of
the residents of that development.
      Improvements of park and recreation land under this subsection B2 shall
be liberally construed and shall include, but shall not be limited to, the
development of: sidewalks; adjacent streets, including, but not limited to,
pavement, curbs, gutters and streetlights; connections with sewers, water,
electrical and other utility lines; and, as appropriate, grading, seeding and/
or sodding, and/or drainage and erosion controls; and as appropriate other
improvements as deemed necessary, including bike/walking paths/trails on the
development and to serve the development and maintenance thereof.
      If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of dedication of land is
not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten (10) years from the
date of receipt, it shall be refunded with interest at the rate(s), in effect
from time to time during said ten (10) year period, paid on investments in the
Illinois public treasurers' investment pool, to the owners of record of all
lots, except lots dedicated pursuant to the provisions hereof, in the
development for which such contribution was made. The refund shall be paid to
the person who is the owner of record on the day which is the tenth anniversary
of the receipt of such contribution. The amount of the refund due to each lot
owner shall be equal to the amount of the original contribution not expended,
divided by the total number of lots in the development (excluding only those
lots which were dedicated pursuant to the provisions hereof) for which such
contribution was made.
      The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market
value of the acres of land in the area, improved as specified herein, that
otherwise would have been dedicated pursuant to the provisions hereof. It has
been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and
surrounding the village is two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) per
acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the
developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection
the developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such
improved land in the area of his development or other evidence thereof and
final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land
shall be made by the village board based upon such information submitted by the
developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board.
      3.   Formulas For Determining Ultimate Population: The following table of
population density represents current and short range projected trends in
family size for a new residential construction and shall, where applicable, be
used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land and/or
the cash contribution in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed
thereto by the developer:
Type Of Unit People Per Dwelling Unit
Type Of Unit        People Per Dwelling Unit
Detached single-family:
2 bedroom           2.017
3 bedroom           2.899
4 bedroom           3.764
5 bedroom (or more) 3.770
Attached single-family:
1 bedroom           1.193
2 bedroom           1.990
3 bedroom           2.392
4 bedroom (or more) 3.145
Multiple-family:
Efficiency          1.294
1 bedroom           1.758
2 bedroom           1.914
3 bedroom (or more) 3.053
 
      For all developments in which the population density cannot be precisely
determined at the time of approval of the development, the land donation
requirement shall be determined as follows. The ultimate population shall be
calculated on the basis of four (4) bedrooms and one acre per detached single-
family unit, which the village board hereby determines to the current trend in
such development within the village; and the bedroom mix used for single-family
attached and multiple-family dwelling units shall be based upon the number of
units and mix of bedrooms as indicated on the approved final plan and plat of
planned unit development.
      In the event a developer files a written objection to one or more of the
tables, formulas and/or determinations pursuant to this section, he shall
submit his own study showing the estimated ultimate population and in that
event final determination of the formula to be used in such calculations shall
be made by the village board based upon such information submitted by the
developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board.
It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions
change over time, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the
payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic
review and amendment as necessary.
      4.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan of the
village calls for a larger amount or size of park and recreational land in a
particular proposed development, than the developer is required to dedicate
pursuant to the provisions hereof, the land needed beyond the developer's
required contribution shall, if so determined by the village board, be reserved
for subsequent purchase by the village, provided that such purchase is made, or
proceedings to acquire such land by condemnation are commenced, within one year
from the date of approval of the final plat or plan for the development.
      5.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: For all developments of less
than fifty (50) acres, public open space which is to be dedicated should, where
possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to
produce usable recreation areas or sites without undue hardship to a particular
developer.
      6.   Dedicated Sites, Topography, Grading And Improvements: The slope,
topography and geology of each dedicated site as well as its surroundings must
be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on dedicated sites shall not
differ greatly from surrounding land. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
dedicated site may, with the consent of the village board, include areas of
minimal or limited suitability, such as wetlands and stormwater detention
areas. The acreage of such areas of minimal or limited suitability shall not be
used to satisfy, or be credited against, the land dedication requirement.
      All sites shall be dedicated as improved sites, i.e., in a graded, seeded
and/or sodded condition with appropriate drainage and erosion controls and
ready for full service by streets (including, but not limited to, pavement,
curbs, gutters and streetlights), sewers, water and electrical and other
utilities, or acceptable provision made therefor. Sidewalks, bike/walking
paths/trails and trees shall be included within the definition of improved
sites.
      7.   Title To Sites: All sites shall be conveyed to the village either by
warranty or trustee's deed. The developer shall be responsible for conveying
good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be responsible for payment of
all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any agricultural
rollback taxes which might be extended or levied against such sites, for any
tax years or periods prior to the time of conveyance.
      8.   Sale Of Dedicated Land: When, in the opinion of the village board,
any such parcel has become unnecessary or unsuitable or inconvenient, such
parcel may be sold as provided by applicable statutory authority and the
proceeds shall be held in trust by the village, solely for such uses as are
provided for herein, and said proceeds shall be subject to the ten (10) year
expenditure requirements from and after the date when said land is converted to
cash proceeds.
      9.   Agreement: When the village requires any cash contribution in lieu
of a dedication of land, the developer shall execute a park donation agreement
and provide the security set forth therein, in the form of agreement approved
by the village attorney.

In the event that it is necessary for the Village to obtain professional
services, including, but not limited to, attorneys, engineers, planners,
architects, surveyors, Village professional staff, financial, traffic or
drainage experts, or other consultants, and if the Village incurs various
expenses such as publication costs and recording fees during any stage of the
approval process, in connection with any Petitioner’s request for the Village
to consider or otherwise take action upon annexation, zoning change, variation,
special use permit, zoning amendment, certificate of approval, ditch line
construction, subdivision development, commercial development, PUD or other
improvement or development upon real property, or if the applicant incurs any
fine associated with violations to any section or provision of the Village
Code, then the Petitioner and Owner of the property shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of such fees, expenses and fines plus ten
percent (10%) to cover the Village’s administrative expenses. At the time the
Petitioner requests action from the Village, the Petitioner will be required to
deposit the following amounts with the Village as an initial deposit to be
credited against fees and costs incurred for the above described services:
Single Family Residential Lot $2,500
0 - 4.99 Acres                $8,000
5 - 15.99 Acres               $16,000

Over 601 Acres                $400,000
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, applications requesting a zoning variation,
zoning amendment, certificate of approval, special use permit, or ditch line
construction permit for a single, previously subdivided lot, shall require a
deposit of $4,000.00.
Final plat approval - 1.5 mile jurisdiction             $4,000.00
The Village shall send the Petitioner a monthly accounting report for the fees
and costs associated with the development or project. The monthly accounting
report will indicate the beginning monthly balance, expenses for the month and
the remaining balance of the deposit. Invoices to support the expenses for the
month will be attached to the monthly accounting report.
A Petitioner who withdraws such application relating to subsections 11-1-1B3,
B4, B5, B6, B8, B10, H5 and H7 of this chapter, may apply in writing to the
Village for a refund of the initial deposit. The Board of Trustees may, in its
discretion, approve the refund application less any actual fees and costs which
the Village has already incurred relative to the petition.
Any professional fees incurred as a direct or indirect result of the
Petitioner, Owner or their agent requesting a professional opinion or otherwise
requesting relief or assistance from the Village, whether or not related to
real property, shall be deducted from the deposit in accordance with this
section if, in the discretion of the Village, a professional opinion is
desired.
If the remaining balance of the Draw Down Deposit Agreement reaches 30% of the
initial deposit, the Village will determine an amount needed to be deposited
with the Village for the continuation of professional services and reviews.
Upon the failure of the Owner or Petitioner to deposit such determined amount,
the Village in accordance with this subsection, may elect to cease all
professional services and reviews. Additionally, no item shall be placed on any
deliberative body’s agenda until such time that the full initial deposit
amount, not 30% of the initial deposit, is deposited or replenished. Further,
the Village may deny any application for a grading, building or other permit,
or certificate of occupancy if such amounts have not been paid in full.
The Mayor and Board of Trustees, Chief Operating Officer and staff members are
hereby authorized to assign requests for professional services to the Village
staff or to consultants as the Mayor and/or Chief Operating Officer deem
appropriate.
When any professional services contemplated by this section are rendered by the
Village staff, the cost associated with such professional service shall be at
the rate of one-hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per hour for each
Department Director or Planning Manager staff time and one hundred dollars
($100.00) per hour for each research/analysis staff member’s time.
The remedies available to the Village as set forth hereinabove are non-
exclusive and nothing herein shall be construed to limit or waive the Village’s
right to proceed against any or all parties in a court of law of competent
jurisdiction.
The remaining balance of any fees deposited pursuant to this Agreement shall be
refunded at the time the Village accepts all required improvements within the
development, pursuant to any improvement agreement executed in connection with
the development of the property that is the subject of the petition or
application. In the event that no improvements are required, any such balance
shall be refunded upon the later occurring of the following events: completion
of Village deliberation on the petition or application, completion of Village
inspections on the project associated with the petition or application,
recording of all necessary documents associated with the petition or
application, or issuance of a building permit upon the property in question.
