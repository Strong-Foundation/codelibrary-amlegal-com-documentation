1-5-4: INDEMNIFICATION OF VILLAGE OFFICIALS:
   A.   The village policy as to indemnification of village officials is as
follows:
      1.   The village has the power to indemnify its officials, both elected
and appointed, pursuant to law.
      2.   The term "officials", as used in this section, shall mean the
president and trustees, the village administrator, department directors and
appointed committee and commission members, as well as all other officers of
the village, whether or not currently serving.
      3.   It is in the best interest of the village to provide for the
indemnification of its officials, both elected and appointed, against claims,
expenses and liabilities to which such persons may be subject by reason of
their having acted in their capacity as a public official.
   B.   The village shall indemnify any official who was or is a party, or may
become a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of any
act or omission, error, misstatement or misleading statement, or neglect or
breach of duty or any other action which could reasonably be construed to have
been committed, attempted or allegedly committed or attempted by such person in
the discharge of his or her duties in his or her capacity as an official, both
elected and appointed, against expenses (including attorney fees), judgments
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in
good faith in a manner in which he or she reasonably believed was in the best
interests of the village. This indemnification shall not apply to any claim,
suit, action or proceeding:
      1.   Which is for the return by any such official, both elected and
appointed, of any remuneration paid in fact to him or her without the previous
approval of the village if it shall be determined by judgment or other final
adjudication that such remuneration is in violation of law or if such
remuneration is to be repaid to the village under a settlement agreement.
      2.   Which is for an accounting of profits made from a purchase or sale
by such official, both elected and appointed, of village property for any
transaction prohibited by the village ethics ordinance.
      3.   Which is brought about or contributed to by the fraudulent or
dishonest acts of such official, both elected and appointed, if a judgment or
other final adjudication adverse to such official establishes that acts of
active and deliberate dishonesty were committed or attempted by such official
with actual dishonest purpose and intent and were material to the cause of
action so adjudicated.
      4.   Which is brought about or contributed to by any criminal activities
of such official, and there has been a judicial determination of said criminal
activities.
      5.   For which the village is not authorized by law to provide
indemnification to the official, either elected or appointed.
      6.   With reference to any of the aforementioned enumerated items, a
presumption shall exist that indemnification shall apply unless a judicial
finding to the contrary is made.
   C.   The termination of any action, suit or proceeding, contrary to the best
interests of the official, by judgment, order, settlement or other resolution
shall not create a presumption that the official did not act in good faith in a
manner in which he or she reasonably believed was in the best interests of the
village. To the extent that an official has been successful, on the merits or
otherwise, in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding or in the defense
of any claim which qualifies herein for indemnification, such person shall be
indemnified against expenses (including attorney fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection therewith. However, the village shall not
withhold payment of attorney fees until the conclusion of any legal
proceedings, but shall pay the attorney fees of the official on a timely basis.
   D.   The village shall indemnify only those officials, either elected or
appointed, from whom or with respect to whom the village has received written
notice of a claim. To the extent practicable, any notice from such official
shall be mailed as soon as practicable and shall identify the official seeking
the indemnification and contain information with respect to the time, place and
circumstances of the claim, the names and addresses of any injured persons or
other claimants and the names of any available witnesses. In the case where
legal proceedings have been commenced, indemnification may be denied if the
official fails to mail to the village, within twenty (20) days after receiving
service of process, a copy of such process relating to a claimed wrongful act
unless: 1) the village has otherwise received a copy of, or written notice of,
such process; or 2) the failure to notify within such twenty (20) day period
does not adversely impact upon the village's ability to defend against such
claim. Notice of the claim shall be made in writing to the village clerk.
   E.   The village shall indemnify the official for any damages, expenses,
court costs and legal fees incurred in connection with any defense of or
settlement of a claim, action or proceeding where such settlement has been
approved in advance by the village, or where the village refuses or fails to
approve such settlement, such settlement is deemed to be reasonable by
independent legal counsel chosen by both the village and the official.
   F.   Any indemnification pursuant to this section shall be made by the
village upon a determination that indemnification of the person is required by
this section. Such determination shall be made: 1) by the president and board
of trustees by a majority vote of a quorum of the board who were not parties to
such claim, suit, action or proceeding; or 2) if such quorum is not obtainable
or, even if obtainable, where a majority of a quorum of the board fails to
approve the indemnification, by independent legal counsel chosen by both the
claimant and the village board.
   G.   Any official against whom any action, suit or proceeding is brought may
employ his or her own attorney; provided, that such attorney is reasonably
acceptable to the village; and provided further, that the costs of such
attorney shall not be paid by the village unless the village attorney or
independent counsel for the village shall have advised the village that such
official's interests should not be represented by the same counsel that
represents the village in such action, suit or proceeding.
   H.   The indemnification provided herein shall be in addition to and not
exclusive of any other indemnity or insurance or other protection to which the
indemnitee may be entitled. The indemnification provided herein shall be
payable whether or not the village has obtained insurance therefor and, in the
case of the death of the indemnitee, shall inure to the benefit of his or her
heirs or successors. (2016 Code)

   D.   On the date that the PSEBA application is deemed complete by the
village, the completed application shall then be submitted to the village
administrator as the preliminary record, and a copy of the same shall be date
stamped and provided to the applicant.
   E.   Upon receipt of a complete application for PSEBA benefits, the village
administrator shall set the matter for an administrative hearing with the
village administrator or his or her designee serving as the hearing officer to
make a determination on whether to grant the application and provide the
applicant with benefits under PSEBA.
   F.   The applicant shall be given written notice of the date for the
administrative hearing not less than ten (10) calendar days prior to the
commencement of the hearing. If the applicant, upon receiving written notice of
the administrative hearing, cannot attend that date, the applicant must contact
the hearing officer in writing within seven (7) calendar days after being
served. The hearing officer shall establish an alternative hearing date within
thirty (30) calendar days of the original hearing date. The applicant's failure

benefits.
   G.   The village administrator may delegate any of his or her authority,
duties and obligations under this chapter, in whole or part, to a designee, or
designees. (Ord. 19-7, 3-5-2019)
1-10-3: POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR HEARINGS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS:
   A.   Hearing Officer: The village administrator or his or her designee shall
be the hearing officer for hearings on applications for PSEBA benefits. The
hearing officer shall have all of the authorities granted under statute,
ordinance and common law relative to the conduct of administrative hearings,
including to:
      1.   Adopt, revise and enforce rules of procedure for hearings;
      2.   Preside over hearings;
      3.   Administer oaths;
      4.   Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the issue of
eligibility under PSEBA;
      5.   Issue subpoenas to secure attendance of witnesses and the production
of relevant papers or documents upon the request of the parties, their
representatives or the hearing officer;
      6.   Rule upon objections to the admissibility of evidence;
      7.   Preserve and authenticate the record of the hearing and all exhibits
in evidence introduced at the hearing; and
      8.   Issue a final written determination on each application for PSEBA
benefits based on the evidence presented at the hearing which shall include
findings of fact, decision and order.
   B.   Hearings: Hearings for the determination of eligibility for benefits
under PSEBA shall be initiated by the village after the submission of a full
and complete PSEBA application, and a determination by the hearing officer that
it is appropriate to proceed with the hearing, which determination shall
include consideration of the status of any disability pension proceeding
related to the applicant and whether the disability pension proceeding has
resulted in a final and non-appealable decision. A hearing shall be held to
adjudicate and determine whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under
the PSEBA. If the applicant is found eligible, the PSEBA benefits provided to
the applicant shall be consistent with the PSEBA.
      1.   Record: Hearings shall be attended by a certified court reporter,
and a transcript of all proceedings shall be made by the certified court
reporter.
      2.   Procedures: The village and the applicant shall be parties at the
hearings and are entitled to representation by counsel at hearings and may
present witnesses, testimony and documents, may cross-examine opposing
witnesses, and may request the issuance by the hearing officer of subpoenas to
compel the appearance of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant
documents. The hearing officer may issue subpoenas to compel the appearance of
relevant witnesses or the production of relevant documents in his or her
discretion.
      3.   Evidence: The Illinois rules of evidence shall apply to the extent
practicable unless, by such application, the hearing officer determines that
application of the rule would be an injustice or preclude the introduction of
evidence of the type commonly relied upon by a reasonably prudent person in the
conduct of her/his affairs. Such determination shall be in the sole discretion
of the hearing officer.
      4.   Final Determination: A written determination by the hearing officer
of whether the applicant is eligible for benefits under the PSEBA shall
constitute a final administrative determination for the purpose of judicial
review under the common law writ of certiorari. Motions to reconsider, set
aside or challenge the final determination of the hearing officer are not
permitted.
      5.   Burden Of Proof: At any administrative hearing, the applicant shall
have the obligation and burden of proof to establish that the applicant is
eligible and qualified to receive PSEBA benefits. The standard of proof in all
hearings shall be by the preponderance of the evidence. (Ord. 19-7, 3-5-2019)
1-10-4: PSEBA BENEFITS GRANTED BY THE VILLAGE:
   A.   Basic Group Insurance Plan: If an applicant is determined to be
eligible for PSEBA benefits, the applicant will be eligible to receive
continued health coverage consistent with the PSEBA under the village's basic
group health insurance plan. The basic group health insurance plan shall be the
least expensive health plan offered to village employees at the time PSEBA
benefits are awarded as determined solely by the village from time to time. The
basic group health insurance plan may change from time to time. A PSEBA
beneficiary may choose to enroll in any other health insurance plan offered by
the village different from the basic group health insurance plan, but shall pay
the difference in insurance premium between the village's basic plan and the
other plan. Failure of a PSEBA beneficiary to timely pay the premium's non-
basic level coverage shall result in coverage in the basic plan. PSEBA benefits
do not include benefits not provided in the village's basic group health
insurance plan, such as, but not limited to, dental, vision, life insurance,
and the like. Individuals receiving benefits from the village under the PSEBA
may only change from one health insurance plan to another during the village's
open enrollment period.
   B.   Reduction Or Elimination Of PSEBA Benefits By Other Health Coverage: If
a PSEBA beneficiary becomes eligible to receive health insurance benefits from
any other source, including, but not limited to, Medicare, the PSEBA
beneficiary's coverage may be reduced or eliminated as determined by the
village consistent with PSEBA. Health insurance benefits payable from any other
source will reduce the PSEBA benefits payable from the village. Receipt of
health insurance benefits from other sources without notice to the village
shall require the PSEBA beneficiary to reimburse the village for the value of
those benefits. The PSEBA beneficiary shall notify the village when the PSEBA
beneficiary becomes Medicare eligible regardless of the status of the
enrollment period, so the village may assist with the transition to Medicare
coverage and/or adjust health insurance benefits or PSEBA benefits accordingly.
   C.   Affidavit Of Continued PSEBA Eligibility: All recipients of PSEBA
benefits from the village shall complete and return to the village
administrator on an annual basis an affidavit verifying the recipient's
continued eligibility for PSEBA benefits. The affidavit must be completed and
returned to the village administrator within sixty (60) calendar days of
written notice from the village. If the recipient does not complete and return
the affidavit within the time required, the village administrator shall give
the recipient an additional written notice providing an additional thirty (30)
calendar days for the recipient to complete and return the affidavit. Failure
to return the affidavit within the time required shall result in the recipient
incurring responsibility for reimbursing the village for premiums paid during
the period the affidavit is due and not filed.
   D.   Disclosure Of Health Insurance Coverage: PSEBA beneficiaries have an
ongoing obligation and shall update health insurance coverage information
provided and failure to do so may result in the denial of benefits and/or
reimbursement to the village for duplicate coverage. If duplicate coverage has
been received by a PSEBA beneficiary, further PSEBA benefits will be denied
until the village has been fully reimbursed by the PSEBA beneficiary for what
it would have been credited if it had known about other coverage. (Ord. 19-7,
3-5-2019)

discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags
suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such

accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or

point within the village and charges for that portion of the interoffice
channels provided within the village. Charges for that portion of the

boundary of the village and the denominator of which is the total number of
channel termination points connected by the interoffice channel. However,
"gross charge" shall not include any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter; 2) the tax imposed by the

such service;

sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to

portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

devices; or
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the

   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those

taxable; 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice; and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.

ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same

SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, "service address" means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added
services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form,
content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than
transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, night of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this definition,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 02-40, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-

that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall
be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the
village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%)
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a

tax in this state. (Ord. 02-40, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-2003; amd. 2016 Code)

by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected

owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid and, if unpaid, is
recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at
retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when

act. (Ord. 02-40, 9-17-2002, eff. 1-1-2003)
3-3-5: RESALES:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in subsections A and B of this section, the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall
not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the
person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that
number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any
sale to such person is nontaxable because of being for resale. (Ord. 02-40, 9-

erroneous payment; provided, that no amounts erroneously paid more than three
(3) years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited. (1976

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-50, 12-19-

regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 00-

   A.   It shall be unlawful for any real property to be a nuisance property or
an aggravated nuisance property.
   B.   It shall be unlawful for any person in charge to permit real property
under his or her control to be a nuisance property or an aggravated nuisance

12, 5-15-2012; amd. Ord. 19-25, 6-18-2019)
5-2A-3: PROCEDURES:
When the chief of police receives one or more police reports documenting the
occurrence of nuisance activity on a property as described in section
5-2A-1 of this article, definition of "aggravated nuisance property", or two
(2) or more police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on
or within a property as described in section
5-2A-1 of this article, definition of "nuisance property", the chief of police
shall examine such reports to determine whether there is a rational basis to
believe that such nuisance activity, if it recurs, may unreasonably interfere
with the use and enjoyment of the property by the residents thereof or the use
and enjoyment of adjoining or nearby properties. Upon such a finding, the chief
shall:
   A.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger
of becoming either a nuisance property or aggravated nuisance property. The
notice shall contain the following information:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
      2.   A statement that the chief of police has information that the
property may be an aggravated nuisance property or a nuisance property, with a
concise description of the nuisance activities that may exist or that have
occurred. The chief of police shall offer the person in charge an opportunity
to propose a course of action that the chief of police agrees will abate the
nuisance activities giving rise to the violation.
      3.   Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police
within five (5) business days to discuss the nuisance activities.
   B.   1. After complying with the notification procedures described herein,
if the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of
additional nuisance activity on or within a property and determines that the
property has become an "aggravated nuisance property" or a "nuisance property",
as defined in section
5-2A-1 of this article, he shall:
         a.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has
become a nuisance property or an aggravated nuisance property. The notice shall
contain the following information:
            (1)   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
            (2)   A statement that the chief of police has determined the
property to be an aggravated nuisance property or a nuisance property with a
concise description of the nuisance activities leading to the finding
supporting the determination.
            (3)   Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of
police within five (5) business days and propose a course of action to abate
the nuisance activities.
         b.   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail
addressed to the person in charge at the address of the property believed to be
an aggravated nuisance property or nuisance property, or such other place which
is likely to give the person in charge notice of the determination by the chief
of police. (Ord. 12-12, 5-15-2012)
         c.   A copy of the notice shall be served on the taxpayer of record at
such address as shown on the tax rolls of Cook County and/or the occupant, at
the address of the property, if these persons are different from the person in
charge, and shall be made either personally or by first class mail, postage
prepaid. (Ord. 12-12, 5-15-2012; amd. 2016 Code)
         d.   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after
five (5) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the
person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of
police.
         e.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property may
be an aggravated nuisance property or nuisance property shall not invalidate or
otherwise affect the proceedings under this article.
      2.   If, after notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the village pursuant to this section, a person in charge
stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a
course of action that the parties agree is reasonably calculated to abate the
nuisance activities, the chief of police may agree to defer to other
enforcement measures for a reasonable period of time. If the agreed course of
action does not result in the abatement of the nuisance activity or if no
agreement concerning abatement is reached, the chief of police shall order a
local ordinance citation be issued to the person in charge and/or shall request
that the village attorney commence a legal action to abate the nuisance.
      3.   The chief of police shall send copies of the notice and citation
required by this section to the village administrator.

require the exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered
for any other purpose. (Ord. 12-12, 5-15-2012)

   A.   In any action seeking the abatement of an aggravated nuisance property
or nuisance property, the village shall establish by a preponderance of the
evidence that the property is an aggravated nuisance property or a nuisance
property. As used in this section, “court” shall refer to either a circuit
court judge or an administrative hearing officer, as applicable.
   B.   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a nuisance
property or an aggravated nuisance property, the court may order such relief as
it deems appropriate. In addition, in the event that it also finds a person in
charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting
or violating this article and permitted the activities to occur, the court may
assess a fine. Each incident that the property constitutes a nuisance property
or an aggravated nuisance property shall constitute a separate offense.
   C.   In determining what remedies to grant, the court may, in its
discretion, consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the
property including, but not limited to:
      1.   The disturbance of neighbors.
      2.   The recurrence of loud and obnoxious noises.
      3.   The actions or lack of actions taken by the person in charge to
mitigate or correct the problem at the property.

      6.   The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting
to correct the condition.
   D.   The court may also require the owner to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy. In the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court, the court may authorize the village to physically
secure the property against use or occupancy. In the event that the village is
authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village
to secure the property shall be made and assessed as a lien against the
property and/or as a judgment against the owner. As used herein, "costs" mean
those costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the
property.
   E.   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure or is fined by the court
shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.
   F.   In the event that the village prevails in any action to enforce this
article, it shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees. (Ord. 12-12, 5-15-2012;
amd. 2016 Code; Ord. 19-25, 6-18-2019)

any other right, remedy or claim the village may have and are not intended to
waive or limit the availability of any common law or statutory cause of action.

it is determined that the property is an unreasonable threat to the public
safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for such interim relief
as is deemed appropriate. (Ord. 12-12, 5-15-2012)

withdrawn or paid without authorization.

thing is "obscene" even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of

person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof,

circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      2.   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the
matter is utterly without redeeming social importance.

be admissible to show:

that the dissemination:
      1.   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under eighteen (18) years of age;
      2.   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material. (2016 Code)

You are listed as the registered Owner or person entitled to possession of the
following described vehicle: (make) (model/year) (other identifying features)
(license plate number and State) which is located on (location) in an
apparently abandoned or unusable condition, to wit: (facts forming basis of
proposed tow) as defined in (ordinance or statutory section).
The Village of Berkeley will tow the vehicle or cause it to be towed after
seven (7) days from the above date of mailing or personal delivery unless you
move the vehicle to a lawful location or request a hearing as set forth below.
Any such hearing will only concern the proposed towing, and will not be
determinative of or adjudicate any parking ticket or other citation concerning
the vehicle. If the vehicle is towed, you will be required to pay all towing
and storage charges before the vehicle is released.
The towing is authorized by the Village Code of the Village of Berkeley.
If you wish to request a hearing on the legality of the present location and
condition of your vehicle, you must contact the office listed below and file in
person or by mail a request for such hearing within 7 days of the above date of
mailing or personal delivery. If you file your request for a hearing by mail,
it must be received by the office listed below within 7 days from the mailing
or personal delivery of this Notice.
   B.   Pretow Hearing Procedures:
      1.   Opportunity For Hearing: The owner or person entitled to possession
of a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven (7) days
after the date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in
writing, a pretow hearing. Subsequent to this seven (7) day period, the vehicle
may be towed, if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the
seven (7) day period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this
subsection will be deemed waived.
      2.   Request For Hearing: Requests for a hearing are to be made in person
to the chief of police or may be made by mail. Forms for such requests shall be
made available at the police department. At the time of making the request, the
owner will be provided a hearing date and time by mail or in person, as the
circumstances require.
      3.   Preliminary Hearing: If the owner or person entitled to a hearing
requests within seven (7) days after the mailing or personal delivery of the
notice, the preliminary hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer
appointed by the chief of police within twenty four (24) hours after receipt of
the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. All interested
persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard and the formal
rules of evidence will not apply and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only
if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the
conduct of their affairs.
      4.   Written Decision: The hearing officer shall make a written decision
upon a preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is
authorized by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the village, with a
specific statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall
be provided a copy of the pretow hearing decision.
      5.   Decision To Tow; Rates:
         a.   If the preponderance of the evidence supports towing with
compliance of the provisions of this division, the hearing officer shall direct
that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and storage costs to then be imposed
upon the owner. The fees to be charged for towing and storage services shall be
no more than the maximum rates set by the chief of police pursuant to the
provisions of this division. The owner of the vehicle having had such a hearing
may avoid the towing by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper
location to a proper, lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of
the vehicle.
         b.   The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for
towing and storage on police ordered tows at rates that do not exceed maximum
amounts to be administratively established by the chief of police and which may
be revised from time to time. However, nothing in this division is intended to
prevent a competitive towing service operator from charging less than the
established maximum rates for police ordered or any other tows. In arriving at
the maximum rates for various services, the chief of police shall consider such
matters as the prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of
vehicles, the types of storage and area requirements for categories such as
large trucks and commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount
of work required to perform various types of towing operations. For
particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious
accidents, the chief of police is authorized to allow towing operators to
charge rates above those established for normal situations. All special charges
must be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account such
matters as the man hours and equipment time required for the job. A towing
service operator must fully itemize in writing the details of such a billing at
special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of
the itemized bill to the owner and to the police department. Any special rates
charged must be customary in the towing industry in the area for the nature and
extent of the services provided. Every towing service operator and the police
department shall have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule
and any special rate policy established by the chief of police for vehicle
owners to view upon request. (Ord. 14-29, 9-16-2014)

line of the through street at the intersection, unless said intersecting street
is determined to be a yield street, as herein described, in which case, every

immediate hazard, but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as
a safe interval occurs, subject, however, to the direction of any traffic
control sign or signal or any police officer at such stop or yield
intersection.

   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights of way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights of way and the village as a whole.
   B.   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights of way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or
public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the village residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights of way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   C.   Scope: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the jurisdiction of the
village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date hereof may
continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement.
   D.   Franchises, Licenses Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   The village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require
utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the
privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within the village rights of way. Utilities that are not required by
law to enter into such an agreement may request that the village enter into
such an agreement. In such an agreement, the village may provide for terms and
conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
      2.   In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider
has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      3.   In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the
provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license or
similar agreement between the village and any telecommunications provider, the
provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension
thereof.
   E.   Conflicting Provisions:
      1.   This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted
prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
      2.   In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations
conflict with the requirements of this chapter, the utility shall comply with
the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent possible without
violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   F.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights of way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 08-07, 2-19-2008)

after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
         c.   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to subsections A, B and C of this section,
the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an application for
a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of subsection D1 of this section.

Under The Cable And Video Competition Law Of 2007: Applications by a utility
that is a holder of a state issued authorization under the cable and video
competition law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days after
submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided
the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
   E.   Effect Of Permit:
      1.   Authority Granted: A permit from the village authorizes a permittee
to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter on village
rights of way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the
permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the
rights of way.
      2.   Term Of Permit: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid
for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
      3.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting
shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such
village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights of way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
      4.   Compliance With Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
   F.   Revised Permit Drawings: In the event that the actual locations of any
facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the
plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the
permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section
8-2-15 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
   G.   Suspension Or Revocation Of Permit:
      1.   Grounds: The village may revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant
to this chapter for one or more of the following reasons:

village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to
arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction
of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering
service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations
hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,
losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct
or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees,
agents or representatives.
   C.   Security:
      1.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this subsection C. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this subsection C at the permittee's
sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit. The security fund shall serve as security for:
         a.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
         b.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this chapter; and
         c.   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee in violation of this chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this chapter to perform that the village must
perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's
failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the
permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
      2.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village
in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
         a.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
         b.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection
by the village of any amounts covered thereby; and
         c.   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
      3.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient
to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village engineer and/or superintendent of public
works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village
estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such
restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each
phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be
undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase
or phases, the village engineer and/or superintendent of public works may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection C3 for any single phase.
      4.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund;
provided, that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
         a.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         b.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         c.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
         d.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
security fund.
      5.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C3 of this section.
      6.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the
village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village; provided,
that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection C3 of this section.
      7.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation;
provided, that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
      8.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect
to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village,
whether reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 08-07, 2-19-
2008)

thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right of way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right of way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village right of
way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 08-07, 2-

under the circumstances.
   E.   Compliance: The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the village. (Ord. 08-07, 2-19-2008)
8-2-9: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
   A.   General Requirements: In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection.
      1.   No utility facilities shall be placed in any location if the village
engineer and/or superintendent of public works determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the village
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village utility facilities.
      2.   The proposed location shall cause only the minimum possible
interference with the use of the right of way and shall cause only the minimum
possible impact upon, and interference with, the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin said right of way.
      3.   No utility facility shall be placed in any location that interferes
with the usual travel on such right of way.
      4.   No utility facility shall be placed in any location so as to limit
visibility of or by users of the right of way.
      5.   The proposed installation shall use the smallest suitable vaults,
boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by
the facility owner, regardless of location, for the particular application.
   B.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways:
      1.   Overhead Parallel Facilities: An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right of way lines of a highway only if:

practicable and not more than eight feet (8') (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right of way line;
         b.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         c.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right of way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (5') (1.5 m) from the right of way line, and any
aboveground appurtenance shall be located within one foot (1') (0.3 m) of the
right of way line or as near as practicable.
   C.   Facilities Crossing Highways:
      1.   No Future Disruption: The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      2.   Cattle Passes, Culverts Or Drainage Facilities: Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities.
      3.   Ninety Degree Crossing Required: Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree (90°) angle to the centerline as practicable.

cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable. The installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   G.   Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk, and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

to the risk involved.
   H.   Appearance Standards:
      1.   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      2.   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right of way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed. (Ord. 08-
07, 2-19-2008)
8-2-10: CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS:
   A.   Standards And Requirements For Particular Types Of Construction
Methods:
      1.   Boring Or Jacking:
         a.   Pits And Shoring: Boring or jacking under rights of way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the village
engineer and/or superintendent of public works from the edge of the pavement.
Pits for boring or jacking shall be excavated no more than forty eight (48)
hours in advance of boring or jacking operations and backfilled within forty
eight (48) hours after boring or jacking operations are completed. While pits
are open, they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades. Shoring
shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and maintained so that it will
safely support all vertical and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it
during the boring or jacking operation.
         b.   Wet Boring Or Jetting: Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         c.   Borings With Diameters Greater Than Six Inches: Borings over six
inches (6") (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and
following pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside
diameter of the following pipe by more than one inch (1") (25 mm).

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipeline testing. Only
one-half (1/2) of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless
special permission is obtained from the village engineer and/or superintendent
of public works.
         b.   Open Trench And Excavated Material: Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by chapter 6 of the "Illinois
Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices". Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right of way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off road location.
         c.   Drip Line Of Trees: The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      3.   Backfilling:
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications For
Road And Bridge Construction". When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         b.   For a period of three (3) years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the engineer and/or superintendent of public works, the utility, at
its expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as
determined by the engineer and/or superintendent of public works.

right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village engineer and/or superintendent of public works or his or her duly
authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have

superintendent of public works shall decide whether a variance is authorized
for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on an
individual basis.
   C.   Conditions:
      1.   The village engineer and/or superintendent of public works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
         a.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
         b.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities
that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
      2.   As a condition for authorizing a variance, the village engineer and/
or superintendent of public works may require the utility requesting the
variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter.
   D.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
engineer and/or superintendent of public works under the provisions of this
chapter shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such other
board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the village clerk within thirty (30) days after the
date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board
shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the
appeal. The village board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 08-07, 2-19-

   A.   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when
the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and
this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned thereto.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

of the increased risk that said trees (or portions thereof) may fall onto the
street or other public access easement.
   C.   Notice To Prune Or Remove: Should any person(s) owning real property
bordering on any street or other public access easement fail to properly prune
trees and other vegetation as hereinabove provided or to properly remove

in effect until paid.

all the persons participating therein of the terms and conditions of the

fire, and ambulance vehicles and/or personnel from responding to emergency
calls within the village, including within the immediate area of the proposed
parade or assembly.
      8.   The parade will not progress from its assembly area to its
disbanding area as expeditiously as reasonably required for the safe and

permit, be less than three (3) hours. The chief of police shall issue permits
for more than a single parade during one day in accordance with the
requirements of this section and subsection 8-4-5A of this chapter; provided,

continuing diversion of so great a number of police officers or other village
personnel so as to prevent normal police protection or other services to the
village. A single permit may cover more than one group or person if their
identities are properly reported on the application. (2016 Code)

traffic, either vehicular or pedestrian, in an unreasonable manner. The chief
of police may impose, as a condition of the permit, reasonable regulations as

police manpower will not be diverted for too long a period of time from its
other duties, giving consideration to the day of the week, the expected amount
of vehicle and pedestrian traffic, weather conditions and the holiday
conditions, if any. The time requested may be reset or diminished if necessary
to avoid relocating or rerouting overly large amounts of vehicles or pedestrian
traffic covered by peak periods of traffic. The chief of police may then issue
a permit with those conditions. (2016 Code)

from the area of the parade or assembly. (2016 Code)
8-4-11: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
The chief of police shall have the authority to revoke a parade or public
assembly permit instantly upon violation of the conditions or standards for
issuance as set forth in this chapter or when a public emergency arises where

of police services for the parade or public assembly would have an immediate
and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons or property. (2016
Code)

corporate authorities by the applicant, permittee, or any person affected by

such appeal.
   B.   In the event that the village board rejects an applicant's appeal, the
applicant may file an immediate request for review with a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided, however, nothing in this chapter shall be construed,

shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24 hour composite sample or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended
solids analyses are obtained from 24 hour composite samples, whereas pHs are
determined from periodic grab samples.) (2016 Code)

that written approval has been granted by the authorized enforcement agency for
its discharge to the stormwater drainage system. (Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015; amd.
2016 Code)
   B.   Connections: The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence
of illicit connections to the stormwater drainage system is prohibited. This
prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in
the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or
practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is
considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line
conveying sewage or any other nonstormwater discharge to the MS4, or allows
such a connection to continue. (Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015)
9-6-5: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   The village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to
a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the MS4, or to waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States and to minimize danger to persons.
   B.   Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have
the person's MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator, in
writing, of the proposed termination of the violator's MS4 access. The violator
may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and
hearing.
   C.   A person violates this chapter if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior written approval
of the authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015)
9-6-6: INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES:
Any person subject to an NPDES construction site activities permit or NPDES
industrial activities permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Said person shall submit to the village a copy of the notice of intent (NOI)
that was provided to the Illinois environmental protection agency (IEPA).
Additional proof of compliance with an NPDES construction site activities
permit or NPDES industrial activities permit may be required, in a form
acceptable to the village, prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015)
9-6-7: MONITORING DISCHARGES:
   A.   The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and
inspect premises subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
   B.   Facility operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination, copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit, and the performance of any additional duties as required by state
and federal law.
   C.   The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any
premises such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the premises'
stormwater discharge.
   D.   The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
   E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
premises to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
   F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency
access to a premises is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the
operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with industrial activity commits a violation of this chapter if the person
denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.
   G.   If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may either
terminate water service or seek issuance of an administrative search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015)
9-6-8: USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause
or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the stormwater
drainage system, or waters of the United States. The owner, or operator of a
commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his/her own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or
other wastes into the municipal stormwater drainage system or waters of the
United States through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises which is or may be
the source of an illicit discharge may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with any terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan ("SWPPP") as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 15-40, 6-
2-2015)
9-6-9: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that
such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 15-40, 6-2-2015)
9-6-10: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or any person responsible for emergency response
for a facility or operation, has information regarding any known or suspected
release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
in pollutants entering stormwater, the stormwater drainage system, or waters of
the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
recovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person, by phone, or by facsimile no later
than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be
confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the village within three
(3) business days of the phone call or personal notice. If the discharge of
prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment,
the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on site
written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its
recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. (Ord.
15-40, 6-2-2015; amd. 2016 Code)
9-6-11: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Administrative And Enforcement Body: The village shall administer,

The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance plus replacement, applicable surcharges and local
capital cost charge composed of a debt service charge and a capital improvement
charge. (1976 Code § 13.48.010)
9-7-2: MEASUREMENT OF FLOW:
   A.   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges
shall be the metered consumption read to the lowest even increments of one
thousand (1,000) gallons.
   B.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part or all of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system,
all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the
village water department for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
   C.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by
the village building department if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.
   D.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the water department. (1976 Code § 13.48.050)
9-7-3: RATES ESTABLISHED:
   A.   Metered Rates: All premises of users are required to be metered.
   B.   Basic User Rate: There shall be and there is established by the village
board of trustees from time to time a basic user rate for the use of and for
service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the village. (1976 Code §
13.48.070; amd. 2016 Code)

reconstruction of the sewage treatment works. (1976 Code § 13.48.060; amd. 2016
Code)
9-7-4: COMPUTATION OF CHARGES:
   A.   Basic User Charge: The basic user charge shall be based upon water
usage as recorded by water meters. It shall consist of operation and
maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:
      1.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
      2.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
costs to each user by volume of water used.
   B.   Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge is computed by
apportioning the annual debt service on a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons
basis.
   C.   Capital Improvement Charge: The capital improvement charge is levied on
all users to provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of
the sewage treatment works. The capital improvement is computed by apportioning
the annual amount to be accrued as a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
(1976 Code § 13.48.020)
   D.   Formula: The wastewater service charge shall be computed by the
following formula:
   CW = (CC + CD + CU) VU
 
Where:
CW = Amount of waste service charge ($) per monthly billing period
CD = Debt service charge (subsection 9-7-3C1 of this chapter)
CC = Capital improvement charge (subsection 9-7-3C2 of this chapter)
VU = Water volume for the billing period
CU = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement (subsection 9-
     7-3B of this chapter)
 
(1976 Code § 13.48.080; amd. 2016 Code)
9-7-5: ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHARGES:
The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed, not less often
than annually, by certified public accountants for the village in their annual
audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect a change in local capital costs or a change in operation and
maintenance costs including replacement costs. (1976 Code § 13.48.030)
9-7-6: MONTHLY PAYMENTS; LIABILITY FOR CHARGES:
The rates or charges for service shall be payable monthly. The owner of the
premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay for the service to such premises, and the service is
furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition that the owner
of the premises and the occupant and user of the service are jointly and
severally liable therefor to the village. (1976 Code § 13.48.090; amd. 2016
Code)
9-7-7: BILLS RENDERED; DUE DATE; LATE PAYMENT PENALTY:
Bills for sewer service shall be included with the monthly water bill and will
be sent out by the village finance director on the first day of the month
succeeding the monthly period for which the service is billed. All sewer bills
are due and payable twenty one (21) days after being sent out. A penalty as
established in the annual fee schedule shall be added to all bills not paid by
the twenty first day after they have been rendered. (1976 Code § 13.48.090;
amd. 2016 Code)
9-7-8: DELINQUENT PAYMENTS; SHUT OFF OF SERVICE:
If the charges for such services are not paid within sixty (60) days after the
rendition of the bill for such services, such services shall be discontinued
and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. (1976 Code §
13.48.100; amd. 2016 Code)
9-7-9: LIEN PROVISIONS:

contract purchasers of all condominium units in the condominium project. The
total estimated deposits shall be based upon the required deposit amount the
developer establishes in the disclosure declaration, pursuant to subsection 10-
17-4C8g of this chapter. The village engineer shall review such estimates or
construction contracts and, if acceptable, approve the amount of the
performance guarantee. The amount of the performance guarantee shall be based

the guarantee is without adequate capital, assets, earnings and liquidity and
is unable to meet any federal or state requirement for reserves, is insolvent,
is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is otherwise in danger of
being unable to honor such guarantee at any time during its term, or if the

village; or d) in any other manner fails or refuses to meet fully any of its
obligations under the guarantee or the applicable subdivision or development
agreement as required pursuant to section
11-3-14 of this code, then the village may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, retain all or any part of the guarantee. The village thereafter
shall have the right to exercise any other action it deems reasonable and
appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or refusal, and to
reimburse itself or a contract purchaser from the proceeds of the guarantee for
all of its costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative
expenses. If the funds remaining in the guarantee are insufficient to repay
fully the village or all aggrieved contract purchasers for all such costs and
expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required guarantee during
the entire time of such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve
equal to the required guarantee during the entire time such guarantee should
have been maintained, then the developer shall, upon demand of the village
therefor, immediately deposit with the village such additional funds as the
village determines necessary.
   E.   Performance guarantees required under this section shall be in a form
approved by the village administrator. The following types of performance
guarantee are acceptable, provided they are consistent with the regulations
below:
      1.   Cash Escrow: A cash deposit may be used as a guarantee, provided the
total amount of the guarantee required is placed with the village administrator
and administered in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision or

letter of credit or surety bond may be used as a guarantee, provided such

surety bond conforms to the terms of the subdivision or development agreement,
and the letter of credit or surety bond is accompanied by a cash deposit in an
amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the total guarantee amount. The cash
deposit shall, at all times until released, as provided herein, be maintained

savings and loan insurance corporation;

Illinois department of insurance to sell and issue sureties in the state of
Illinois.
   F.   The developer may make a written request to the village engineer to
partially reduce the amount of the approved performance guarantee. The village
engineer shall be authorized to approve such partial reductions in the amount
of the performance guarantee, provided:
      1.   There shall be no more than three (3) partial reductions approved in
the amount of the performance guarantee during the life of the subdivision;
      2.   Partial reductions shall be authorized only following the acceptable
completion of the following improvements:

systems have been properly installed and all erosion and sediment controls are
operational;

would not allow the village to complete the installation of public and private
improvements associated with the subdivision; and (Ord. 2005-64, 11-15-2005)
      6.   In no event shall any portion of the cash deposit be reduced prior

code official shall determine the reasonable minimal time necessary to correct
the violations based upon the number and severity of the violations. The code
official shall serve or send notice to the property owner or the listed

recent license application. Said notice shall include the following:
      1.   Description of the property sufficient for identification;

frame.
      1.   If any violation is not corrected, the code official may issue a
written notice extending the time to correct the violations if there has been a
good faith effort to correct the violations and the failure to do so was due to

village codes have not been met upon the completion of such reinspection, the
license for the rental residential property shall be suspended.

licensee is convicted by a court of a violation of any property maintenance
regulations.

attorney to file a complaint against the owner in the circuit court.

certified mail to the owner or his property agent's last address provided on
the last license application.
   D.   A property owner whose license has been suspended may request a
reinspection prior to revocation. If, upon reinspection, the code official
finds that the licensed property in connection with which the notice was issued
is now in compliance with this chapter, including the payment of all
outstanding fees, the code official may reinstate the license. The request for
a reinspection shall not stay the revocation of the license unless the code
official grants such request pursuant to a showing of good cause by the
property owner.
   E.   A license may also be revoked when, in the opinion of the code
official, emergency conditions exist in a rental residential property that
require the immediate vacating of a structure as specified in the village's
property maintenance code.
   F.   A license which has been properly revoked as herein provided shall not
be reinstated. The property owner may, however, obtain a new license after all
violations have been corrected and by following the procedures for obtaining a
new license as set forth in this chapter.
   G.   Whenever a license is revoked, the code official shall send notice to
the property owner or the listed property agent at the last address provided on
the most recent license application. Said notice shall be sent by registered
mail, return receipt requested. The code official shall also notify all tenants
of the rental residential property by posting a notice on all entrances to the
rental residential structure. The notice to the tenants shall include the
following:

license said property, the code official shall notify all tenants of the rental
property by posting a notice on all entrances to the rental property indicating
the following:
      1.   You are hereby notified that the owner or agent of this rental
structure has failed to license this rental property in violation of the
Berkeley Village Code.
      2.   You must vacate this structure within 45 days of this notice.

prior to expiration of the rental permit for renewals and within sixty (60)
days of initial application for new applicants. At the seminar, the crime free
multi-housing coordinator shall provide, at no cost, samples of the crime free
lease addendum and shall review any clauses within actual leases with the
village's legal department to determine if the clause is similar to the crime
free lease addendum. The crime free housing addendum or equivalent lease clause

license issued hereunder if it appears to his/her satisfaction from the report
of any village officer or village employee or any other available information
that the licensee is violating and/or is in violation of the provisions set
forth in Article 5-2A of this code. Any suspension or revocation of a license
shall be pursuant to the provisions set forth in title 4, chapter 1 of this
code and the penalties as set forth in section
1-4-1 of this code.
   H.   A tenant who is an innocent party or the victim of a crime, including
but not limited to actual or threatened domestic violence or sexual violence
will not be in violation of this Section. Nothing in this Section prohibits the
eviction of the perpetrator of the domestic violence, sexual violence, or other
criminal activity. A tenant is encouraged to report crimes without fear of
their status as a tenant.
   I.   A tenant will not be in violation of this Section, and a nuisance
property or aggravated nuisance property cannot be established in any way,

party.
   J.   A violation of this Section, a crime free lease addendum, or an
equivalent lease clause required herein may constitute good cause for immediate
termination of the lease; provided, however, that a violation shall not be good
cause to terminate the tenancy if the immediate termination of the lease would
violate Section 1-2-1.5 of the Illinois Municipal Code, as amended (65 ILCS 5/
1-2-1.5). (2016 Code; amd. Ord. 23-49, 10-3-2023)

It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to require a presale inspection of
residential, commercial or industrial buildings or structures in the Village
for compliance with the Village's Property Maintenance Codes prior to the
issuance of a Code compliance stamp on the deed for the sale or transfer of the
real property on which that building or structure is located. (Ord. 16-23, 5-
17-2016; amd. Ord. 18-42, 8-7-2018)
10-20-2: PRESALE INSPECTIONS:
   A.   No real property within the Village shall be sold, transferred or
retitled unless the seller obtains a presale inspection by the building
official or his or her designee. The inspection report shall state that the
building complies with all applicable building and zoning regulations of the
Village that were inspected, or in the alternative lists the building and
zoning violations.
   B.   The request for a presale inspection should be made at least thirty
(30) days prior to the scheduled date of the closing. A sale for purposes of
this section includes contract sales, exchanges, conversions to condominiums
and transfers of any legal or beneficial interest of the real estate. If the
request is not filed, the required fees are not paid, or a person participates
in such a sale in violation of this section either as a seller or by receipt of
a sales commission in connection therewith, that person shall be in violation
of this chapter and be subject to the penalties as provided in section
1-4-1 of this Code. Any contract executed in violation of this chapter shall be
voidable by the buyer.
   C.   The building official shall supply a form for the requested presale
inspection which shall specify the address of the real property being sold or
transferred, the improvements located thereon, the type of construction of such
improvements, and the number of apartments contained therein. If such real
property is commercial or industrial property, the number of square feet of
space shall be specified. Upon receipt of the form and payment of the
inspection fee(s) as provided in the annual fee ordinance, the building
official shall cause such buildings or structures on the real property to be
inspected. Inspections shall include all of the building or structure when all
utilities are connected and servicing the building and structure.
   D.   The inspection report will be valid provided the real property is
transferred within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date such application
is submitted and the appropriate inspection fee paid to the Village. Any real
property to be transferred more than one hundred eighty (180) days following
such date is subject to reapplication, reinspection and the repayment of fees
in accordance with this chapter as if no previous inspection report had been
issued.
   E.   If the Village's inspector is unable to inspect any portion of the
property or equipment in or on the property for any reason including but not
limited to the termination of electric, gas or water service at the time of
inspection, the Village shall require the establishment of an escrow amount
with the buyer’s attorney in an amount as determined by the Village building
official and/or his/her designee of the estimated cost to bring any uninspected
portion of the property or equipment in the building into Code compliance and
if related to those terminated utilities in an amount of not less than five
thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each utility that has been terminated.
   F.   A Village of Berkeley compliance agreement shall be completed by the
party posting the escrow. If there are any violations or fees related to the
escrow or building during the escrow period and any fines, penalties, judgments
or other costs authorized by this Code are accessed; those fines, penalties,
judgments or other costs shall be deducted from the escrow prior to its
release, and, after all deductions are made, any escrow remaining will be
refunded upon compliance within thirty (30) days. (Ord. 16-23, 5-17-2016; amd.
Ord. 17-44, 7-18-2017; Ord. 17-55, 9-5-2017; Ord. 18-42, 8-7-2018)
10-20-3: CODE COMPLIANCE STAMP:

Administrator or designee shall promptly provide the owner with a
predeprivation due process hearing within five (5) business days of the
request. If the owner disputes the Village's determination as to liability, the
seller may pay the bill under protest, and may pursue any remedies available to
the seller to recover the claimed overcharge. (Ord. 16-23, 5-17-2016; amd. Ord.

development agreement, then the village may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, retain all or any part of the guarantee.
         b.   The village thereafter shall have the right to exercise any other
action it deems reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such
failure or refusal and to reimburse itself from the proceeds of the guarantee
for all of its costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative
expenses. If the funds remaining in the guarantee are insufficient to repay
fully the village for all such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash
reserve equal to the required guarantee during the entire time such guarantee
should have been maintained, then the subdivider shall, upon demand of the
village therefor, immediately deposit with the village such additional funds as
the village determines necessary.
   E.   Performance guarantees for the installation of public and private
improvements shall be in a form approved by the village administrator. The

and administered in accordance with the provisions of the subdivision or
development agreement.
      2.   Irrevocable Letter Of Credit And Cash; Surety Bond: An irrevocable
letter of credit or surety bond may be used as a guarantee, provided such

by the village administrator, the administration of such letter of credit or
surety bond conforms to the terms of the subdivision or development agreement,
and the letter of credit or surety bond is accompanied by a cash deposit in an
amount not less than ten percent (10%) of the total guarantee amount. The cash
deposit shall, at all times until released, as provided herein, be maintained
at not less than ten percent (10%) of the initial total guarantee amount. The
financial institution issuing the irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond
shall be:
         a.   Insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or federal
savings and loan insurance corporation;
         b.   Chartered in the state of Illinois or have a registered agent in
Illinois;
         c.   Have adequate capital, assets, earnings and liquidity to ensure

Illinois.
   F.   The subdivider may make a written request to the village engineer to
partially reduce the amount of the approved performance guarantee. The village
engineer shall be authorized to approve such partial reductions in the amount
of the performance guarantee, provided:

the amount of the performance guarantee during the life of the subdivision;

completion of the above;
      4.   The amount of such partial reduction shall not exceed seventy five
percent (75%) of the estimated cost to construct such improvements;
      5.   In no event shall the amount of the performance guarantee be reduced
to a level which, in the sole and absolute opinion of the village engineer,
would not allow the village to complete the installation of public and private
improvements associated with the subdivision; and
      6.   In no event shall any portion of the cash deposit be reduced prior
to final release of the performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection.
   G.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection F of this
section, public improvements shall not be considered accepted by the village
unless and until each of the following reviews and actions have been
successfully performed:
      1.   Filing with the village engineer a formal written request to accept
the improvements by the subdivider;
      2.   Certification by the village engineer that all or specific
individual public improvements required to be constructed or installed have

and specifications and that the inspected construction or installation thereof

included in the guarantee have been one hundred percent (100%) completed to the
satisfaction of the village engineer, the village administrator shall release
the guarantee.
   I.   Prior to the acceptance of required public improvements by the village,
the subdivider shall execute a maintenance agreement, acceptable in form and
substance to the village attorney, for the repair or replacement of defective
materials and workmanship for a period of time extending one year from the
effective date of village acceptance of such improvements. A maintenance
guarantee conforming with the requirements of this subsection shall be
submitted with the maintenance agreement. The amount of the maintenance
guarantee shall be ten percent (10%) of the total amount of the initial
performance guarantee for the subdivision. The village engineer shall be
authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the village following board
of trustees acceptance of such improvements. If, after one year, no defects in
workmanship or materials have developed, the maintenance guarantee shall be
released by the village engineer. In the event any defects are identified by
the village engineer during the term of the maintenance guarantee, the balance
of such guarantee shall be released only after: 1) the village has been fully
reimbursed for amounts expended in correcting defective improvements; or 2) the
subdivider or developer has successfully repaired all such defects to the
satisfaction of the village engineer. (Ord. 05-02, 1-18-2005)

which are therein dedicated as such, whether located within the corporate
limits of the village or outside thereof, or contains existing streets outside

an acceptance by the village of such streets or thoroughfares, nor of the
improvements constructed or installed thereon or therein, irrespective of any
act or acts by any officer, agent or employee of the village with respect to
such streets or improvements. The acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares
shall be made only by the adoption of a resolution by the village board after
there has been filed with the village clerk a certificate by the village
engineer certifying that all improvements required to be constructed or
installed in or upon such streets or thoroughfares in connection with the
approval of the plat of subdivision by the village board have been approved by
him.
   B.   No permanent connection shall be made or maintained with the sanitary
or storm sewer or water supply systems of the village to serve property within

provided, has been filed, and not until any money owing the village for permit
fees for the connections with said systems, or any of them, have been paid.

notification, shall be cause for denial of an application.
      4.   The zoning administrator shall, upon making a finding that an
application is complete and that the proposed use complies with all applicable
provisions of this title, approve and authorize the application for further
consideration by other officials, boards, or commissions.
In any case where an application is denied, the zoning administrator shall
state specific reasons therefor and shall site specific provisions of this
title upon which such denial is based. If relief from such demand would be
available pursuant to a companion application, the zoning administrator shall
so inform the applicant and shall promptly process such companion application.
If relief from the zoning administrator's denial of the application would be
available by variation, special use permit, or other provision of this title,
but no application for such relief has been filed, the zoning administrator
shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the appropriate provisions of
this title.

a plat conforming to the standards for a preliminary plat as set forth in the

property involved in the violation. The zoning administrator may recommend and
the board of trustees may order such revocation; provided, however, where the
original rezoning permit, variation or approval was granted following a public
hearing required pursuant to this title, the revocation shall be preceded by a
similar hearing.
      5.   Fines: In the enforcement of this title, the zoning administrator
shall, where necessary and appropriate, order the issuance and enforcement of
citations to recover fines and penalties for the violation of this title as
authorized by state law and this title.

      1.   Any person who shall violate, disobey, omit, neglect or refuse to
comply with, or who shall resist enforcement of, any provision of this title
shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor
more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day a
violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense; provided,
however, that the zoning administrator shall levy fines according to the
following tiered schedule:
 
Between first through third day   $200.00
Between fourth through sixth day  225.00
Between seventh through tenth day 250.00
From eleventh day forward         Not less than $300.00 nor more than $750.00
 
      2.   The zoning administrator may, in his sole and absolute discretion,
stop levying fines upon satisfactory evidence that a violator of this title has
begun to or is in the process of remedying any such violation. In the event
that a violator of this title stops without good cause or otherwise fails to
finish any remedial action to cure any violation of this title, the zoning
administrator shall be authorized to again levy fines of between three hundred
dollars ($300.00) and seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per day for any
such violation that remains uncorrected.
   D.   Private Remedies Preserved: Nothing in this section shall be
interpreted to prevent any person entitled to relief in law or equity by reason
of a violation of the provisions of this title from bringing an appropriate
action to secure such relief. (2005 Zoning Code)

committee shall be held at the call of the chairman, and shall be open to the
public. A meeting shall be called whenever an application for a building permit
is submitted for the committee's consideration. The committee shall keep
minutes of its proceedings and shall keep records of its examinations, and
other official action. The committee may adopt its own rules of procedure not
inconsistent with this title.
   B.   Procedure:
      1.   The zoning administrator, upon his or her determination that a
request for a building permit warrants the attention of the architectural
review committee, or upon a similar determination of the corporate authorities,
shall refer such request, together with all necessary drawings, including, but
not limited to, preliminary exterior drawings, sketches, landscape and site
plans and other related materials on a specific project for their review.
      2.   The committee shall meet not later than fifteen (15) days from the
date of the zoning administrator's request for meeting, and shall review the
proposed building design, at which time the presence of the petitioner or his
architect shall be requested to answer questions. The committee shall provide
to the petitioner such advice, counsel, suggestions and recommendations on
matters pertaining to appearance as they may deem necessary to develop a plan
that would comply with standards set forth in this section.
      3.   Upon finding that the preliminary exterior drawings, sketches,

the character of the immediate neighborhood and are in compliance with the
general standards provided in this section, the committee shall submit its
recommendations for approval, or revisions, if any, and the underlying
reasoning thereof, to the zoning administrator with a letter signed by the
chairman of the committee.
      4.   The fact that the architectural review committee is considering
compliance of an application with the requirements of this section shall not be

building and zoning aspects of the project, while said application is pending.
      5.   The zoning administrator, upon receiving such recommendation from
the committee, shall proceed with the issuance of a building permit if the
recommendation is favorable, and provided the proposed building complies with
all other provisions of this title, and all other applicable village
ordinances.
      6.   If the recommendations of the architectural review committee
pertaining to suggested revisions are rejected by the petitioner, or if the
committee recommends denial of the request for the building permit, the zoning
administrator shall refer this matter to the corporate authorities within seven
(7) days from the date of the committee's communication, or from the date the
zoning administrator is informed by the petitioner or his representative that
they object to the committee's recommendation. The board of trustees shall hear
and decide as provided by law. After receiving the evidence from the applicant,
the zoning administrator, and any owners or occupants of buildings in the
immediate vicinity of the proposed building, the board of trustees shall
determine whether the erection of the proposed building will not meet the
standards, requirements and purposes of this section, and shall affirm the
denial of the permit or shall direct the zoning administrator to issue a
building permit.
   C.   Design Standards: All new construction of buildings and all
alterations, modifications and improvements to existing buildings shall be
architecturally designed in a manner not manifestly inferior, radically
different from, nor incompatible with existing buildings in the neighborhood
(including buildings under construction). The term "architectural design" shall
mean the external style and general arrangement of such portion of a building
or structure as is designed to be open to view from a public street, place, or
way, including the kind, color and texture of the building material of such
portion, and the types of windows, doors, lights, attached or ground signs and
other fixtures appurtenant to such portion. The following standards shall be
used by the committee in evaluating any matter before it:
      1.   Repetition Of Design:
         a.   No developer shall construct two (2) or more buildings of like
exterior design on the same side of the street unless such buildings are
separated by two (2) or more buildings or building sites, or combination
thereof, of completely dissimilar design.
         b.   All buildings shall be considered to be of like exterior design
unless they have substantially different floor plans, or they have similar
floor plans, but each building is oriented in a different direction so as not
to expose similar elevations in any one direction, or in the opinion of the
architectural review committee, their elevations are deemed substantially
different in exterior appearance.
      2.   Exterior Materials:
         a.   Freestanding buildings and buildings fronting on more than one
street shall have the same material or different but architecturally harmonious
materials used on all exterior walls. Nothing herein contained shall be held to
require the use of more than one material on any one wall unless such variety
of material is used for decorative purpose.
         b.   All single- and multiple-family dwellings shall be faced with
pressed face bricks or other masonry material, except cinder block, on all
sides. Other materials may be used above the first floor for a specific
architectural effect upon approval by the architectural review committee and
acceptance by the zoning administrator.
         c.   All office and commercial buildings shall be faced with pressed
face brick or glass, except utilization of the other noncombustible material
other than common brick or cinder blocks may be used above the first floor for
a specific architectural effect upon approval by the architectural review
committee and acceptance by the zoning administrator.
         d.   All industrial buildings shall be faced with pressed face bricks
on their entire elevations. Other noncombustible material is only permitted for
a specific architectural effect and only for decorating purpose, provided no
common brick or cinder blocks are used for this purpose, and only upon approval
by the architectural review committee and acceptance by the zoning
administrator.
      3.   Landscaping Plan And Material: All site plans for buildings
constructed in R-3 and R-4 residential districts and B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, M-1,
M-2, and M-3 districts shall be referred to the architectural review committee
with respect to the location, design, and type of plant material used in the
landscaping of sites as required by this title.
   D.   Power To Establish Separate Committee: The corporate authorities may at
any time, and in their sole and absolute discretion, establish a separate
architectural review committee to carry out those responsibilities set forth in
subsection 12-3A-6E of this article and this section. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-3A-8: CONFLICT OF INTEREST:
No member of the planning and zoning commission shall participate in
discussions or vote on a request related to any matter belonging to a client he
or she is serving, or related to any business of which he or she is owner,

without the prior approval by the corporate authorities by resolution duly
adopted. The corporate authorities may, but shall not be required to, hold a
public hearing prior to adoption of such approval resolution. Such approval by
the corporate authorities shall be in lieu of any zoning certificate and shall
be subject to the special standards contained in subsection C of this section
and the use limitations contained in subsection F of this section, all as
determined and imposed by the corporate authorities, in its sole discretion.

such temporary use is located.
   F.   Use Limitations:
      1.   General Limitations: Every temporary use shall comply with the use
limitations applicable in the district in which it is located as well as with
the limitations made applicable to specified temporary use by subsection D of

traffic reasonably expected to be generated by such temporary use would have
undue detrimental effects on surrounding streets and uses.
      5.   Conflicts With Other Temporary Uses: No temporary use shall be
permitted if such use would conflict with another previously authorized
temporary use.
      6.   Parking: Before approving any temporary use, the zoning
administrator shall make an assessment of the total number of off street
parking spaces that will be reasonably required in connection with the proposed
temporary use, on the basis of the particular use, its intensity, and the
availability of other parking facilities in the area, and shall approve such
temporary use only if such off street parking is provided. No temporary use
shall be authorized that would, in the opinion of the zoning administrator,
unreasonably reduce the amount of off street parking spaces available for use
in connection with permanent uses located on the zoning lot in question.
   G.   Additional Conditions: Every temporary use shall, in addition, comply
with, and the zoning administrator may impose, such other conditions as may
reasonably be necessary to achieve the purposes of this title or to protect the

12-7-1: ESTABLISHMENT; PURPOSES:
There are four (4) business zoning districts within the village. These
districts are intended to govern the locations and uses of a full range of
business and commercial establishments needed to serve the citizens of the
village and its trade area. The regulations of the various business districts
are designed to provide for grouping of business and commercial establishments
that are compatible in scope of services and method of operations. The four (4)
districts are:
   A.   The B-1 local business district that is intended to provide areas and
govern uses therein for a range of shopper and personal service types of
establishments in order to serve the general shopping needs of a consumer
population that is located in the village and in areas immediately adjoining
the village.
   B.   The B-2 local business district that is intended to provide areas and
govern uses therein for a range of shopper and personal service types of
establishments, including those providing entertainment, automotive sales,
repair and services and other highway oriented services, in order to serve the
general shopping and service needs of a consumer population that is located in
the village and in areas adjoining the village.
   C.   The B-3 community business district that is intended to regulate uses
permitted in B-1 and B-2 business districts that are concentrated in areas
showing shopping center characteristics but without the benefit of unified
ownership or control of individual properties. The B-3 community business
district is designed to overcome the shortcomings resulting from absence of
such unified ownership, and provides for integrated use of common accessory
facilities such as customer parking, and the access driveways to the major
streets for the benefit of public welfare, safety, and elimination of traffic
congestion on the major streets.
   D.   The B-4 regional/community business district that is intended to
require the comprehensive, coordinated and integrated development into multiple
use retailing and limited service facilities meeting the needs of the community
and surrounding region. (2005 Zoning Code)

12-7D-4: CONDITIONAL USES:
The St. Charles Road corridor plan (corridor plan), completed in 1999,
established a framework for promoting economic development within the village
and the revitalization of the St. Charles Road corridor and served as the basis
for establishing this B-4 district. Permitted uses within this district are
restricted to multiuse retailing and limited services; however, in a small
number of cases, existing properties are not well suited for those uses
enumerated in section
12-7D-3 of this article. The purpose of this section is to allow for certain
office and service uses in limited quantities within the B-4 district, without
diluting the purpose of the B-4 district established by the corridor plan,
which is to require the comprehensive, coordinated and integrated development
into multiple use retailing and limited service facility meeting the needs of
the community and surrounding region.
   A.   In existing nonresidential lots, where the intent of the B-4 zoning
district to permit multiuse retailing and limited service facilities is
restricted by the existing characteristics of the property, approval of a
conditional use permit may be granted for the following uses, provided that the
village plan commission finds that the location is appropriate and not in
conflict with the corridor plan:
      Business offices.
      Doctor or other medical offices.
      Professional, scientific, and technical services as defined in the NAICS
code (see appendix).
   B.   Uses must meet at least four (4) of the following conditions:
      1.   Lot frontage less than or equal to seventy five feet (75');
      2.   Lot size less than or equal to ten thousand (10,000) square feet;
      3.   Existing on site parking does not conform to minimum parking
requirements;
      4.   Building is one story and based on the parking, lot size, and
structural conditions of the building it has little potential to be converted
with additional stories;
      5.   Professional marketing of the property for retail uses has been
unsuccessful during a period of six (6) or more consecutive months; or is
      6.   Indicated as not a probable redevelopment site in the corridor plan.
   C.   Unless otherwise specified in this article or specified as a condition
of approval, the height limits, minimum yards, lot area, and sign requirements
shall be the same as for other uses in the B-4 district.
   D.   The privileges, obligations, and provisions of any conditionally
permitted use under this section shall be for the sole benefit of and shall be
binding on the applicant. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow the
applicant to transfer its privileges, obligations, or any other provision to
any person or entity without a new application for approval for any person or
entity other than the applicant. (Ord. 2006-16, 4-18-2006)
12-7D-5: CURRENT USES:
   A.   All current uses in conflict with this article will remain as legal
nonconforming uses until such time that the building is demolished, square
footage would be changed, or the building would be substantially remodeled. At
that time, the property will comply with the terms of this article.
In regard to nonconforming religious uses, to advance religious expression or
identification, but which does not substantially expand or extend the size or
useful life of the building, shall not be considered substantially remodeled
for the purposes of this article but shall be in compliance with all other
applicable ordinances.
   B.   In existing buildings, which, due to their unique size, placement,
parking, or architecture, or office and professional nature, transfer of
ownership or other replacement of a legal nonconforming use with a use of
substantially similar character, is permitted; provided, that the replacement
use is occupied within six (6) months after the discontinuation of the original
legal nonconforming use and continuous efforts are made to seek a replacement
use in the interim. (Ord. 2006-16, 4-18-2006)
12-7D-6: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING:
Off street parking and off street loading shall be in accordance with
regulations set forth in chapter 12, articles A and B of this title. (Ord.
2006-16, 4-18-2006)
12-7D-7: SIGNS:
Signs shall be in accordance with regulations set forth in chapter 13 of this
title. (Ord. 2006-16, 4-18-2006)
12-7D-8: SITE PLAN REVIEW:
New uses that require changes to the square footage of an existing building,
substantial reconfiguration or remodeling of an existing building, or new
buildings, will require site plan review and approval. (Ord. 2006-16, 4-18-
2006)
12-7D-9: DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
The owner of a parcel not meeting the lot size requirements established for a
B-4 zone herein, upon proof of hardship and of a best efforts attempt over a
reasonable length of time to make the parcel part of a larger accumulation by
purchase of adjoining property or sale to adjoining landowners, may request a
variance to the square footage development requirements set forth herein as a
part of the special use process. (Ord. 2006-16, 4-18-2006)

12-8-1: ESTABLISHMENT; PURPOSES:
There are three (3) manufacturing districts. The regulations for manufacturing
districts are designed to provide for the establishment of a limited range of
industrial and allied activities and to govern their operations in a manner
that will not have a deleterious effect on residential or business areas. It is
essential that adequate industrial sites are provided to attract new industry
compatible with the present quality of the village. Adequate sites and
industrial expansion will create growth and development of the village economic
and tax base and provide a variety of employment for its labor force. The three
(3) districts are:
   A.   The M-1 manufacturing district which is designed to provide an
environment suitable for industrial activities that requires a pleasant and
nuisance free environment and will be compatible with adjacent residential and
business uses.
   B.   The M-2 manufacturing district that fully encompasses the Proviso
freight yard, since it is a use of unique characteristics, and it is necessary
to provide special provisions for this use in order to maintain the general
characteristics of the northern neighborhoods in Berkeley and also to encourage
the future conversion of these yards into some uses more compatible with the
general area characteristics.
   C.   The M-3 manufacturing district shall have as its purpose and function
to allow construction and development of village garage and motor vehicle
facilities, billboard advertising signs, and television, telecommunication and
similar nonoccupancy type structures. (2005 Zoning Code)

Landscaping in general shall be parklike in effect, blending into and enhancing
the adjoining properties. Vertical and horizontal elements must be in good
balance and of good design. Plant groupings shall be of good composition.
Specifically, landscaping must provide for the following:
   A.   Boundary Plantings: Effective and attractive boundary plantings to
screen the parking area from adjoining residential properties.
   B.   Evergreen Hedging: Low to medium (below 5 feet) evergreen hedging
between street boundaries and the surfaced parking area. (Hedging may be
clipped formally or free flowing with periodic trimming to ensure density and
uniformity.)
   C.   Intermittent Screen Planting: Intermittent screen planting between
street boundaries and surfaced parking area, designed to break the view of the
parking lot and to provide visual attraction to the foreground.
   D.   Species Allowed: Only those species and varieties of trees, small
trees, shrubs, evergreens and ground cover plants which are professionally
rated as the choice of their kind shall be used. Selection should be predicated
on beauty that endures and increases with age, and minimum care and maintenance
requirements.

mortar mixing plants. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-8-5: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
Any use established in the manufacturing districts after the effective date
hereof shall be operated in such a manner as to comply with applicable
performance standards as hereinafter set forth governing: a) noise; b)
vibration; c) air pollution; d) fire and explosive hazards; e) glare or heat;
and f) radiation hazards; and no use already established on the effective date
hereof shall be so altered or modified as to conflict with such applicable
performance standards. Prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy, the zoning
administrator may, at his discretion, require certification from a testing
laboratory or professional engineer, approved by the corporate authorities,
that the proposed use is capable of complying with the applicable performance
standards.
   A.   Noise:
      1.   Instrumentation: Noise shall be measured with a sound level meter,
octave band analyzer meeting the applicable standards of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI S1.4-1971 and ANSI S1.11-1966). The instruments shall
be set to the flat response weighing scale and the meter to the response.
      2.   Maximum Permitted Sound Levels:
         a.   Table designates the maximum permitted sound levels that apply on
or beyond appropriate district boundaries. Where more than one set of sound
levels apply, the most restrictive shall govern. Readings are to be made at
points of maximum noise intensity. In all instances in which a manufacturing
district does not adjoin a residence or business district, the performance
standards governing noise shall apply at or beyond the nearest residential or
business district boundary line.
         b.   At no point on the boundary of a residence or business district
shall the sound pressure level of any individual operation or plant (other than
background noises produced by sources not under control of this title such as
the operation of motor vehicles or other transportation facilities) exceed the
decibel levels in the designated octave bands shown in table I of this section.

a fence made of wood in which the open spaces, when viewed at a right angle to
the vertical fence plane, constitute less than one-third (1/3) of the total
fence contour. The "total fence contour" is the entire square foot area within
and between the outside vertical outline of the fence. The open spaces are
areas within the total fence contour, which, when viewed at right angles to the
vertical fence plane, allow clear visibility through said fence plane. (2005

Code)
12-11A-2: APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   District Height Limitations: The requirements set forth in this article
shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are
installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each
zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures
shall not apply to towers and antennas.
   B.   Public Property: Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased,
or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the
requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such
antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority.
   C.   Amateur Radio; Receive Only Antennas: This article shall not govern any
tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under seventy feet (70') in
height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station
operator or is used exclusively for receive only antennas.
   D.   Preexisting Towers And Antennas: Any tower or antenna for which a
permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date hereof shall not be
required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements
of subsections 12-11A-3E and F of this article. Any such towers or antennas
shall be referred to in this article as "preexisting towers" or "preexisting
antennas". (2005 Zoning Code)
12-11A-3: GENERAL GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose And Goals: The purpose of this article is to establish general
guideline for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are
to:
      1.   Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and
minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
      2.   Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites;
      3.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent
possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal;
      4.   Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas; and
      5.   Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
   B.   Principal Or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a
tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including, but
not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such
requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the
antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers
that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the
provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a
nonconforming use or structure.
   C.   Inventory Of Existing Sites: Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the zoning administrator an inventory of its existing towers
that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within
one-fourth (1/4) mile of the border thereof, including specific information
about the location, height, and design of each tower. The zoning administrator
may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative
approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations
seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority;
provided, however, that the zoning administrator is not, by sharing such
information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are
available or suitable.
   D.   Aesthetics And Lighting: The guidelines set forth in this subsection
shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas
governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing authority may
waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are
better served thereby.
      1.   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject
to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to
reduce visual obtrusiveness.
      2.   At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures
shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and
built environment.
      3.   If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
      4.   Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA
or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority
may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that
would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
   E.   Federal Requirements: All towers must meet or exceed current standards
and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal
government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of
the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at
the owner's expense.
   F.   Building Codes And Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable village building codes and
the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the
governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and
standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice
being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days
to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to
bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the governing
authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-11A-4: PERMITTED USES:
   A.   General: The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted
uses and shall not require administrative review or a special use permit.
Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply with subsections 12-11A-3D, E and F of
this article and all other applicable ordinances.
   B.   Specific Permitted Uses: The following uses are specifically permitted:
      1.   Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, in the village manufacturing districts; provided, however, that such

to the height of the tower;
      2.   Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower
(such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding
nonresidential structure) that is fifty feet (50') in height or greater, so
long as said additional antenna adds no more than twenty feet (20') to the
height of said existing structure; and
      3.   Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long
as the addition of said antenna adds no more than twenty feet (20') to the
height of said existing tower and said existing tower is not a preexisting
tower; provided, however, that such specific permitted use shall not include
the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in
connection with said antenna. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-11A-5: ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS:
   A.   General:
      1.   The planning and zoning commission may administratively approve the
uses listed in this section.
      2.   Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the zoning
administrator, providing the information set forth in subsections 12-11A-6B and
D of this article.

a preexisting tower and further including the placement of additional buildings
or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as
the addition of said antenna adds no more than twenty feet (20') to the height
of said existing tower.
      3.   Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district other
than the village manufacturing district that, in the judgment of the planning
and zoning commission, is in conformity with the goals set forth in subsection
12-11A-3A of this article.
      4.   Locating any tower in a zoning district other than the village
manufacturing districts, provided a licensed professional engineer certifies
the tower can structurally accommodate the number of shared users proposed by
the applicant; the planning and zoning commission concludes the tower is in
conformity with the goals set forth in subsection 12-11A-3A of this article and
the requirements of subsections 12-11A-3D, E and F of this article; the tower
is to be set back from any existing off site residence a distance equal to the
height of the tower; and that the tower meets the following height and usage
criteria:
         a.   For a single user, up to ninety feet (90') in height;
         b.   For two (2) users, up to one hundred twenty feet (120') in
height; and
         c.   For three (3) or more users, up to one hundred fifty feet (150')
in height. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-11A-6: SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
   A.   General: The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special
use permits:
      1.   If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section
12-11A-4 of this article or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant
to section
12-11A-5 of this article, then a special use permit shall be required for the
construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts.
      2.   In granting a special use permit, the governing authority may impose
conditions to the extent the governing authority concludes such conditions are
necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining
properties.
      3.   Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits,
whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed
professional engineer.
   B.   Information Required: Each applicant requesting a special use permit
under this article shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view
and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed
and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and
dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography,
radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking,
fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the
governing authority to be necessary to assess compliance with this article.
   C.   Factors Considered In Granting Special Use Permits: The governing
authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue
a special use permit, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the
burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the governing
authority concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby:
      1.   Height of the proposed tower;
      2.   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
      3.   Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
      4.   Surrounding topography;
      5.   Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
      6.   Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness;
      7.   Proposed ingress and egress; and
      8.   Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as
discussed in subsection D of this section.
   D.   Availability Of Suitable Existing Towers Or Other Structures: No new
tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate
that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna may consist of any of the following:
      1.   No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements.
      2.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
the applicant's engineering requirements.
      3.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
      4.   The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed antenna.
      5.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
      6.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
   E.   Setbacks And Separation: The following setbacks and separation
requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use
permit is required; provided, however, that the governing authority may reduce
the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this article
would be better served thereby:
      1.   Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower
from any off site residential structure.
      2.   Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
      3.   In zoning districts other than industrial or heavy commercial zoning
districts, towers over ninety feet (90') in height shall not be located within
one-fourth (1/4) of a mile from any existing tower that is over ninety feet
(90') in height.
   F.   Security Fencing: Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less
than six feet (6') in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate
anticlimbing device; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive
such requirements, as it deems appropriate.
   G.   Landscaping: The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required; provided,
however, that the governing authority may waive such requirements if the goals
of this article would be better served thereby:
      1.   Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant
materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent
residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip
at least four feet (4') wide outside the perimeter of the compound.
      2.   In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether.
      3.   Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall
be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers
sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be
a sufficient buffer. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-11A-7: REMOVAL OF ABANDONED ANTENNAS AND TOWERS:
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of six (6)
months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower
shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the
governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or
tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the governing authority may
remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two (2) or
more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective
until all users cease using the tower. (2005 Zoning Code)

12-12A-1: AUTHORIZATION:
Subject to the limitations of this article, off street parking is permitted as
an accessory use in all districts. Off street parking as a principal use is
permitted only when expressly authorized by the regulations applicable to the
district in question. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the
right of any person to provide off street parking in excess of the requirements
herein established but all such parking shall comply with the standards of this
article. All parking area design shall be reviewed and approved by the zoning
administrator. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-12A-2: APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING, NEW AND EXPANDED USES:
   A.   General Applicability: Except as provided otherwise in this section,
the provisions of this article shall apply to, and off street parking spaces
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this article shall be provided for,
all existing and new uses.
   B.   Change In Existing Use: Whenever a use existing on the effective date
hereof is changed thereafter to a new use, parking facilities shall be provided
as required herein for such new use; provided, however, that when any such
existing use was deficient in required parking spaces on such effective date,
such new use may be established with a deficiency in required parking spaces
equal in number to not more than such preexisting deficiency.
   C.   Increase In Use Intensity: Whenever the intensity of use of any
structure or use is increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor
area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for
required parking spaces, parking spaces as required herein shall be provided
for such increase in intensity of use.
   D.   Minor Additions: Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
section, no building or use lawfully existing on the effective date hereof, or
any amendment hereto establishing parking requirements with respect to such
structure or use, shall be required to provide any additional parking spaces
pursuant to this section unless and until the aggregate increase in the units
of measurement by which the parking requirement is calculated shall equal ten
percent (10%) or more of the units of measurement required upon such effective
date, in which event parking spaces as required herein shall be provided for
the total aggregate increase.
   E.   Accessory Use: Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
the continued utilization of any parking space as an accessory use to any
structure or use for parking of a vehicle that may be lawfully parked in such
space solely because such space does not satisfy the locational or design
requirements of this title, or any amendment hereto, if such space was validly
in use as an accessory use to such structure or use on the effective date of
this title or such amendment. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-12A-3: LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES:
   A.   General Rule:
      1.   Except as provided in subsections B and C of this section, parking
spaces required by this article shall be located on the same zoning lot as the
use to which they are accessory.
      2.   Off street parking spaces may be provided on surface lots,
underground, under a building, or in parking structures. Parking lots, areas,
and garages shall comply with the yard requirements made applicable to them by
the regulations of the district in which they are located.
   B.   Parking For Townhouses: Not more than two (2) parking spaces located in
a garage, driveway, or other area reserved for the exclusive use of the
residents of an individual dwelling unit shall be counted toward the parking
spaces required pursuant to subsection 12-12A-12A1 of this article. Not more
than two (2) spaces required by said subsection may, and at least one such
space shall, be located in an area or areas available for use in common by at
least three (3) such individual units. Such areas may include parking spaces
located in parking areas or lots within the development in which such units are
located, whether located on or off the lot on which such units are located;
provided, however, that no such required space shall be located farther than
three hundred feet (300'), measured along an established pedestrian circulation
route, from the unit it is required to serve.
   C.   Deficiency Spaces: When proposed to eliminate a parking deficiency or
when required because of a change in use or an increase in use intensity
pursuant to subsection 12-12A-2B or C of this article, parking spaces may be
located within any district adjacent to the district in which the principal use
in question is a permitted use, or within the same zoning district as, and
within one thousand feet (1,000') of, the zoning lot on which the use to be
served is located; provided, however, that such remote parking spaces may be
allowed only when such remote site is covenanted to remain as parking for so
long as said parking spaces are required to meet the standards of this title.
   D.   Parking In Yards: Off street parking spaces, open to the sky, may be
located in required interior side yards and rear yards. In all business
districts, the required off street parking spaces may be located in a front
yard adjoining a street, not less than ten feet (10') from a lot line or may be
located in a side yard adjoining a street, not less than five feet (5') from a
lot line. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-12A-4: DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   Design:
      1.   Space Dimensions:

60 degrees    9 feet 0 inches 19 feet 0 inches 6 feet 8 inches
90 degrees    9 feet 0 inches 18 feet 0 inches 6 feet 8 inches
 
         b.   The stall width dimensions shall be increased to sixteen feet
(16') for required handicapped parking spaces or to the width required under
applicable state law, whichever is greater.
         c.   The stall dimensions shall be reduced by one-half foot (1/2') in
length and one-half foot (1/2') in width for commuter parking lots and
structures.
         d.   Except for parallel parking spaces, the stall dimensions may be
reduced by one-half foot (1/2') in length and width in parking lots and
structures accessory to office and institutional uses where the planning and
zoning commission finds that the typical parking space in such lot or structure
will not be occupied by more than two (2) different vehicles during the course
of the business day.
      2.   Access To Street:
         a.   Least Interference: All parking lots, areas, and garages shall be
so located and designed as to provide access to adjacent streets with the least
interference with through traffic movements.
         b.   Driveways:
            (1)   Driveways shall have return radii of twenty feet (20') at the
point of access to the street.
            (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, driveways
serving single-family dwellings and driveways providing direct access from a
parking lot to a street (and not serving as a circulation aisle) may traverse
any required yard. The surface area of any such driveway from a parking lot to
a street shall not exceed an area calculated by multiplying the width of the
driveway times the depth of the required yard times a factor of 1.5.
         c.   Curb Cut Width: No curb cut across public property shall exceed
thirty feet (30') without the written approval of the zoning administrator.
         d.   Access Across Separate Zoning Lot: No access to an adjacent
street shall be provided through a zoning lot, other than the zoning lot on
which the parking lot is located, except across a permanent, recorded access
easement in form and substance satisfactory to the village attorney.
      3.   Turnaround Area: Every parking lot or garage, other than a parking
lot or garage accessory to a single-family dwelling, shall be provided with a
turnaround area or other means to permit cars to exit the parking lot or garage
without backing onto any street or sidewalk.
      4.   Surface, Drainage And Markings:
         a.   Every off street parking lot and garage shall be surfaced with a
bituminous or portland cement concrete pavement providing all weather, durable,
and dustless surface. Unless otherwise approved by the village engineer, such
construction shall meet the following minimum standards for structural
materials derived from the "Illinois Department Of Transportation Manual",
current edition:
            (1)   For parking areas designed and intended principally for
passenger automobiles, a minimum coefficient rating of 2.25.
            (2)   For parking areas designed and intended for vehicles other
than the above, a minimum coefficient rating of 2.40.
         b.   All parking surfaces shall be graded and drained to dispose of
surface water accumulation by means of a positive stormwater drainage system
connected to a public stormwater sewer system. Individual stalls shall be
clearly identified by painted markings four inches (4") to six inches (6") in
width.
      5.   Car Stops: Every parking lot and garage, except that accessory to a
single-family dwelling, shall be provided with curbs, car wheel stops,
guardrails, barrier fences, or other suitable devices designed and located to
protect required screening devices, landscaping, and structures from damage by
vehicles using such lot or garage. This provision shall not be construed to
require car wheel stops for every parking space, but only in those cases where
the zoning administrator determines that such stops are necessary or desirable
to achieve the purposes of this subsection B5.
      6.   Circulation Aisles: Each parking space, except spaces accessory to a
single-family dwelling, shall be accessed by a circulation aisle of a width, in
feet and inches, as specified below:
 
Parking Angle One-Way Aisle Width Two-Way Aisle Width
Parallel      12 feet 0 inches    24 feet 0 inches
45 degrees    12 feet 6 inches    24 feet 0 inches
60 degrees    14 feet 6 inches    24 feet 0 inches
90 degrees    22 feet 6 inches    24 feet 0 inches
 
      7.   Tandem Spaces: No parking spaces shall be designed in tandem so that
ingress to or egress from one space is blocked by a second space, except for
spaces accessory to single-family or multiple-family dwelling units.
      8.   Back Up Area: Each parking space, except spaces accessory to a
single-family dwelling, shall be provided with a sufficient back up area to
permit egress in one maneuver, consisting of one backward and one forward
movement, and shall be designed so that no vehicle is required to back up onto
any street.
      9.   Lighting: Fixed lighting shall be provided for all parking lots and
garages accommodating more than ten (10) vehicles. Such lighting shall be so
arranged as to prevent direct glare of beams onto any public or private
property or streets by the use of luminare cutoffs. All lighting shall be
reduced to security levels at all times of nonuse.
      10.   Tree Planting Areas And Islands: Trees located within planting
islands in paved areas shall have a minimum landscaped area of at least thirty
six (36) square feet of surface area and a depth sufficient to allow the bottom
of the tree ball to be planted with a washed gravel layer at the bottom of the
tree planting area to allow proper drainage. If the soil is impervious, then a
drainage pipe shall connect the tree planting area to a drainage structure.
   B.   Maintenance: All tree planting areas, parking lots, garages, and areas
shall be properly maintained at all times so as to be free of potholes, broken
curbs, and other damaged or neglected features. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-12A-5: COMPUTATION OF REQUIRED SPACES:
   A.   Fractional Spaces: When determination of the number of required parking
spaces results in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction shall
require one additional parking space.
   B.   Capacity Calculations: When parking spaces are required on the basis of
capacity, capacity shall be determined based on the occupancy standards
established by the village building code.
   C.   Bench Seating: In houses of worship and other places of assembly in
which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating
facilities, each eighteen inches (18") of such seating facility shall be
counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off
street parking facilities under this title.
   D.   Population Calculations: When parking spaces are required on the basis
of the number of customers, students, or similar measure, the maximum number
for which the structure is designed shall govern, except that when the
structure has no design capacity, the maximum number present at any one time
shall govern. When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of
employees, the number of employees working during the largest shift shall
govern. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-12A-6: USE OF LOTS OR GARAGES RESTRICTED:
No off street parking lot or garage shall be used for any purpose other than
the temporary storage of motor vehicles related to the premises. The storage of
merchandise and the sale or commercial repair of vehicles are prohibited. (2005

permitted on a lot other than the lot on which the structure or use served is
located, the owner of record of such lot shall be the same as the owner of
record of the lot occupied by the structure or use in which the parking
facilities are accessory. A covenant running with the land must be recorded in
the office of the recorder of deeds of Cook County, on the lot upon which the
accessory off street parking is located which prohibits any other use on that
lot, and a copy of the recorded covenant certified by the recorder of deeds of
Cook County must be deposited with the zoning administrator. The covenant shall
not be released until such time as either one of the following conditions
occurs:

the principal use terminated; or
      2.   Another lot of the required size within the required distance is
properly developed and used for the required accessory off street parking in
place of and in lieu of the initial lot used for accessory off street parking
with the same requirements, covenants, and conditions attaching to such
substitute accessory use lot as approved by the same authority as required for
approval of such initial lot.
   B.   Parking Plan or Lease Agreement: As an alternate, the required off site
parking spaces may be provided either through:
      1.   A parking plan approved by the Zoning, Administrator, which the
Zoning Administrator may approve, condition, modify and revoke from time to

authorities.
   C.   Maximum Distance Between Principal Use And Off Site Parking: In no
event shall off site parking be more than three hundred (300) linear feet, as
measured along: 1) the common street frontage; or 2) as measured from the
nearest property line on each lot between the principal use served and the off
site parking lot property. (2005 Zoning Code; amd. Ord. 21-19, 4-6-2021; Ord.

erect, construct, enlarge, relocate, alter, convert or maintain a sign shall be
made to the village zoning administrator upon a form provided by the village
clerk. All applications for such a permit shall include plans and
specifications showing the dimensions, materials, and required details of
construction including loads, stresses and anchorage of the sign or proposed
sign and any such other information as the zoning administrator may reasonably
require to assure compliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to,
whether staging of the proposed work will be located on public property. All
such applications for a permit shall be executed by the owner of the zoning lot
upon which the sign is to be installed, constructed, enlarged, relocated,
altered, converted, or maintained. All such applications for a permit shall
include payment of the fee as set forth in this title.
   D.   Issuance Or Denial: It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator,
upon the filing of an application for a permit, to examine the permit and its
supporting plans, specification, and other data related to the sign and sign
structure. If it appears that the sign and sign structure are in compliance
with all the requirements of this chapter and the proper fee has been paid, and
if there are no violations of any other ordinances of the village, then the
zoning administrator shall issue a permit. The zoning administrator is
obligated to either grant or deny an application for a permit within a
reasonable time after receiving a complete application. If the application is
denied, the zoning administrator shall state, in writing, the reasons therefor.
   E.   Void If Work Not Commenced: A permit issued by the zoning administrator
becomes null and void if work is not commenced within one hundred eighty (180)
days of issuance.

maintaining a sign for which a permit is required above shall notify the zoning
administrator upon completion of the work so that an inspection for compliance
can be performed.

permit fee is required, shall be maintained in good condition at all times. The
zoning administrator shall have the authority to order the painting, repair,
alteration or removal of signs which become dilapidated or are abandoned, or
which constitute a physical hazard to the public safety.
   H.   Signs Declared Unlawful: The zoning administrator may declare any sign
unlawful if it endangers public safety by reasons of inadequate maintenance; or
if it has been abandoned. Prior to declaring any sign unlawful the zoning
administrator shall first send a written notice to the owner of the zoning lot
upon which the sign is located informing said person that the sign endangers
the public safety or that appears to be abandoned. The owner of the property on
which the sign is located, or someone in their stead, shall then have ten (10)
days to cure any specified problems before a citation under this section can be
issued. (Ord. 06-31, 8-15-2006)

shall not, after being discontinued or abandoned, be reestablished. Any use of
such sign thereafter shall be in conformity with the regulations of this
chapter.
   B.   Maintenance: Normal maintenance of a nonconforming sign is permitted,
including necessary nonstructural repairs which do not extend or intensify the

nonconformity.
   D.   Damage Or Destruction: If a nonconforming sign is damaged or destroyed
by any means, to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more of its replacement
value at that time, the sign can be rebuilt or used thereafter only in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. In the event the damage or
destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, based
upon prevailing costs, the sign may then be restored to its original condition
and its use may continue until the nonconforming sign is otherwise abated. In
either event, restoration or repair of this sign must be started within a
period of three (3) months from the date of damage or destruction and
diligently pursued to completion. In every case, the reconstructed sign shall
conform to the building and electrical codes in force at the time of its
reconstruction.
   E.   Abatement Of Nonconforming Signs: All signs legally in existence as of
September 1, 1995, and not conforming with all regulations and requirements of
the village's sign code passed as amended in September of 1995, pursuant to

this chapter, or any person erecting a temporary sign that violates this
chapter, shall be subject to a penalty as set forth in this code, as amended

      1.   An accurate plat of the zoning lot, at such scale as the zoning
administrator may reasonably require depicting the location of building(s),
parking lots, driveways, landscaped areas, and the location of each existing
and proposed sign on such zoning lot, whether the sign requires a permit or
not.
      2.   A report providing a computation of the maximum sign area, the sign
area for each proposed individual sign, the total of the sign area for all of
the proposed signs on the zoning lot, the height and dimensions of all proposed
signs on the zoning lot.
   C.   Common Signage Plan: If the owner(s) of two (2) or more contiguous
zoning lots (disregarding intervening streets and alleys) or if the owner of a
single lot with more than one building (not including any accessory building)

signs, but need not specify the exact dimension or nature of every transitory
window sign.

plan or common signage plan may contain such other restrictions as the owner(s)
of the zoning lots may reasonably determine.
   G.   Consent: The master signage plan or common signage plan shall be
executed by all owners of record and persons with legal possession of the
zoning lot(s) involved (or their authorized agents) in such form as the zoning

by filing a new master signage plan or common signage plan that conforms with
all requirements of this chapter then in effect.
   J.   Existing Signs Not Conforming To Common Signage Plan: If any new or
amended common signage plan is filed for a zoning lot upon which existing signs
are located, the common signage plan shall include a schedule for bringing into
conformance, within six (6) months, all signs not conforming to the proposed

of such a master signage plan or a common signage plan and any provision of
this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall control. (Ord. 06-31, 8-15-

condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
         b.   The condition upon which the petition for a variation is based
would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         c.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any

         e.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; and
         f.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood.
   B.   Imposition Of Conditions And Restrictions: The corporate authorities
may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a
variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in this

area and width; and provided that, the corporate authorities in considering any
request for permission to build upon an undersized tract, including an
undersized platted lot or combination of undersized platted lots, shall
whenever such combination is possible require that two (2) or more undersized
lots be combined, or subdivided into building sites of at least or
substantially the same size as required by section
12-6-2 of this title. The corporate authorities shall have the power to permit
the use of building sites smaller than required where such combination and
subdivision cannot be done without substantial hardship to the owner or owners
of the lots in question. Where a number of undersized lots is owned as a tract,
the corporate authorities shall limit variations to permit as little divergence
as possible from the tract size required by this title. In its consideration,
both of the possible combination of undersized lots into proper building sites,
and the division of large lots into building sites not of the sizes herein
required, the board shall consider both the hardship to the property owner and
the type of building sites already used in the immediate neighborhood.
      5.   To permit the same off street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses; provided, that substantial use of
such facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week.
      6.   To reduce the applicable off street parking or loading facilities by
fifty percent (50%).
      7.   To allow parking lots in residence districts and municipal or
governmental uses in any district.
      8.   To grant additional time for, or permit extension of, a
nonconforming use.
      9.   To increase the number of accessory uses permitted on a residential
lot.
   B.   Time Limit: No order of the corporate authorities granting a variation
shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months from the date of such
order unless a building permit is obtained within such period and the erection
or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within such
period. (2005 Zoning Code; amd. Ord. 07-16, 7-17-2007; Ord. 11-25, 7-19-2011;

meeting thereafter of the corporate authorities.
   B.   Hearing And Notice Requirements:
      1.   A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the

public hearing and submit to the corporate authorities a report of its findings
and recommendations.
      2.   Upon being advised of the date of hearing, the village clerk shall
cause notice of the hearing to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the village not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty
(30) days prior to said hearing.
      3.   The published report shall be supplemented by sending copies of the
same to the property owners, as recorded in the office of the county recorder
of deeds and as appears from the tax records of this county of all property
within two hundred fifty feet (250') in each direction of the location for
which the amendment is requested, and the number of feet occupied by all public
roads, streets, alleys, and other public ways shall be excluded in determining
the two hundred fifty foot (250') requirement.
      4.   In case an amendment does not affect the zoning district boundaries
but only changes the text of this title, unless such change directly affects
any particular property, publication of the notice of the hearing as required
in subsection B2 of this section shall suffice, and notification of individual
property owners shall not be required.

Zoning Code)
12-16-4: DECISIONS:

percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of
twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley
therefrom, or by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly
opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, is filed with the village clerk,
an amendment shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3)
of all the village trustees elected. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-16-5: STANDARDS:
The wisdom of amending the zoning map or the text of this title is a matter
committed to the legislative discretion of the corporate authorities and is not
dictated by any set standards. However, in determining whether a proposed
amendment should be granted or denied, the corporate authorities should be
guided by the principle that its power to amend this title is not an arbitrary
one but one that may be exercised only when the public good demands or requires
the amendment to be made. In considering whether that principle is satisfied in
any particular case, the corporate authorities should weigh the following
factors:
   A.   Existing uses and zoning classifications of properties in the vicinity
of the subject property;
   B.   Trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property;
   C.   Extent to which the value of the subject property is diminished by the
existing comprehensive plan designation or zoning classification;
   D.   Extent to which such diminution in value is offset by an increase in
the public health, safety, and welfare;
   E.   Extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties
would be affected by the proposed amendment;
   F.   Extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would be
affected by the proposed amendment;
   G.   Extent, if any, to which future orderly development and redevelopment
of adjacent properties would be affected by the proposed amendment;
   H.   Suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or permissible
under its present comprehensive plan designation or zoning classification;
   I.   Availability of adequate ingress and egress from the subject property
and the extent to which traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the
subject property would be affected by the proposed amendment;
   J.   Availability of adequate public utilities and essential public services
to the subject property to accommodate the uses permitted or permissible under
the present comprehensive plan designation or zoning classification;
   K.   Length of time that the subject property has been vacant or
underutilized, in consideration of the context of the pace of development and
redevelopment in the vicinity of the subject property; and
   L.   Community's need for the proposed map amendment and for the uses and
development that it would allow. (2005 Zoning Code)

12-17A-3: Application; Hearing
12-17A-4: Decisions
12-17A-5: Standards
12-17A-1: PURPOSE:
The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive ordinance is based on the
division of the entire village into districts, within each of which are
permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such
permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses
which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which
on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public
facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation
for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this title as
special uses and fall into two (2) categories:
   A.   Public: Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly
regulated utilities, or uses traditionally affected by public interest.
   B.   Private: Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their
peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public,
and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood, may have to be
established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be
allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under this title. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-17A-2: INITIATION:
Special uses may be proposed by the board of trustees, planning and zoning
commission, and by any person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest,
a possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive
possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is
described in the application for special use. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-17A-3: APPLICATION; HEARING:
   A.   Filing Of Application: An application for a special use shall be filed
with the village clerk and thereafter entered into the records of the first
meeting thereafter of the board of trustees.
   B.   Hearing And Notice Requirements:
      1.   A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded, by the
village clerk, to the planning and zoning commission with a request to hold a
public hearing and submit to the board of trustees a report of its findings and
recommendations.
      2.   The planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time, not
to exceed sixty (60) days, for the hearing of the request for special use
permit and give due notice to the parties in the same manner as provided in
subsection 12-16-3B of this title.
      3.   Such public hearing shall be held upon such notice, and findings and
recommendations of the planning and zoning commission shall be submitted to the
village board not later than sixty (60) days following the public hearing.
(2005 Zoning Code)
12-17A-4: DECISIONS:
   A.   Rendering Of Decision: The board of trustees, upon report of the
planning and zoning commission and without further public hearing, may grant or
deny any proposed special use in accordance with applicable Illinois statutes,
or may refer it back to the planning and zoning commission for further
consideration.
   B.   Written Protest By Property Owners: In case a written protest against
any proposed special use signed and acknowledged by owners of twenty percent
(20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across the alley
therefrom, or by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly
opposite the frontage to be altered, is filed with the village clerk, the
special use cannot be passed except on the favorable vote of two- thirds (2/3)
of all members of the board of trustees elected. (2005 Zoning Code)
12-17A-5: STANDARDS:
No special use permit shall be recommended or granted unless the applicant
shall establish that:
   A.   The proposed use and development will be in harmony with the general
and specific purposes of this title and for the regulations of the district in
question and with the purposes and intent of the comprehensive plan;
   B.   The proposed use, drainage, and development will not have a substantial
undue adverse effect upon adjacent properties, the character of the area, or
adversely impact the public health, safety and welfare;
   C.   The proposed use and development will be constructed, arranged, and
operated so as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the
use and development of neighboring properties in accordance with the applicable
district regulations;
   D.   The proposed use will be adequately served by essential public
facilities and services, such as streets, public utilities, drainage
structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and
schools, or the applicant will provide adequately for such services;
   E.   The proposed use and development will not cause undue traffic
congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through residential streets;
and
   F.   The proposed use and development will comply with all additional
standards imposed on it by the provisions of this title or any special
conditions imposed by the corporate authorities. (2005 Zoning Code)

12-17B-1: AUTHORITY:
The corporate authorities may, in accordance with the procedures and standards
set forth in article A of this chapter, by ordinance duly adopted, grant
special use permits authorizing the development of planned developments in any
district of the village. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-2: PURPOSE:
   A.   Planned developments are a distinct category of a special use and are
authorized for the same general purposes as all other special uses. Planned
developments may include uses or combinations of uses allowed by right or by a
special use permit within the underlying district, or any use prohibited within
the underlying zoning district; provided, however, that any use otherwise
prohibited within the underlying zoning district meets, in the sole and
absolute discretion of the corporate authorities, the conditions, procedures,
and standards of this article.
   B.   A planned development is granted through a special use permit and is
intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise applicable zoning district
regulations based upon a thorough review of a development proposal for larger
parcels. A planned development encourages developers to creatively develop
property to promote the following planning objectives:
      1.   Creation of a more desirable environment than would otherwise be
possible through strict application of applicable zoning district regulations;
      2.   Promotion of a creative approach to the development of land and
related facilities resulting in better design, including aesthetic amenities;
      3.   Combination and coordination of architectural styles, building
forms, and building relationships;
      4.   Incorporation of unique but complementary development within an
existing neighborhood context;
      5.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics, or
incorporation of site amenities, such as natural topography, vegetation,
wetlands, and other environmentally desirable features;
      6.   Provision of open space; and
      7.   Encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety,
and welfare. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-3: SCOPE; PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK PLANNED DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL:
   A.   Scope: The provisions set forth in this article shall apply to the
development or redevelopment of any: 1) parcel that is twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet or more in area; 2) adaptive reuse of a building that is ten
thousand (10,000) square feet or more in gross floor area; or 3) multi-family
development of any size.
   B.   Parties Entitled To Seek Planned Development Approval: An application
for a special use permit to authorize a planned development may be filed by the
owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject property.
(Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-4: PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION:
   A.   Application: A preliminary application for a special use permit for a
planned development shall be filed in accordance with section
12-17A-3 of this chapter and subsection 12-17B-13E of this article.
   B.   Initial Staff Review: The preliminary application shall be reviewed by
village staff or consultants retained by the village to identify any issues
that should be considered by the corporate authorities. All costs incurred by
the village in this review of the preliminary application shall be reimbursed
in accordance with subsection 12-17B-13B of this article and ordinance 99-03,
otherwise known as the cost recoveries ordinance, approved and adopted by the
corporate authorities on February 16, 1999.
   C.   Referral To Corporate Authorities: Every preliminary application for a
special use permit for a planned development shall be referred by the village
clerk to the corporate authorities.
   D.   Preliminary Consideration By Corporate Authorities: The corporate
authorities shall, not later than the first regular board of trustees meeting
after referral of such application, commence and conclude a preliminary review
of the application with the applicant. The preliminary review shall be used to
acquaint the corporate authorities with the application and to provide the
applicant with any preliminary views or concerns of the corporate authorities.
The applicant should consider the views or concerns expressed by the corporate
authorities while plans are still flexible and adjustments still possible, and
prior to the time that the applicant expends funds necessary to prepare and
complete the documentation required for a formal application. No final or
binding action shall be taken by the corporate authorities during their
preliminary review, and all views and concerns expressed by the corporate
authorities shall be deemed by all parties as solely advisory, and in no way be
deemed to create, or to prejudice, any rights of the applicant, or to obligate
the corporate authorities in any manner whatsoever to approve or deny any
formal application following full consideration thereof pursuant to this
article. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-5: DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT PLAN:
   A.   Purpose: The development concept plan is intended to provide the
applicant an opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope, character
and nature of the entire proposed planned development without incurring undue
cost. The development concept plan is the basis on which the required public
hearing is held, thus permitting public consideration of the proposal at the
earliest possible stage. In order to permit the village and the applicant to
proceed with some assurance, approval of the development concept plan binds the
applicant and the village with respect to the following basic elements of
development:
      1.   Categories of uses to be permitted;
      2.   General location of residential and nonresidential land uses;
      3.   Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of
nonresidential uses;
      4.   General architectural style of the proposed development, including
conformity with the village's design standard set forth in section
12-3A-7 of this title;
      5.   General location and extent of public and private open space,
including recreational amenities;
      6.   General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems;
      7.   Staging of development; and
      8.   Nature, scope and extent of public dedications, improvements or
contributions to be provided by the applicant.
   B.   Formal Application: Subsequent to the corporate authorities' review and
consideration of the preliminary application, but in no event more than six (6)
months thereafter, a formal application for approval of a development concept
plan shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of subsection 12-17B-
13F of this article. No application for approval of a development concept plan
shall be filed unless the corporate authorities shall have first reviewed a
preliminary application for a special use permit for a planned development.
   C.   Corporate Authorities Referral: Every properly filed and completed
application for approval of a development concept plan shall be referred by the
corporate authorities to the plan commission. The failure of the corporate
authorities to act on a properly filed and completed application within thirty
(30) days of the corporate authorities' receipt thereof, shall be deemed to be
a decision to refer the application pursuant to this subsection.
   D.   Public Hearing: In any case where an application for approval of a
development concept plan is referred by the corporate authorities pursuant to
subsection C of this section, a public hearing shall be set, noticed and
conducted by the plan commission.
   E.   Action By Plan Commission: Within twenty one (21) days following the
conclusion of the public hearing, the plan commission shall transmit to the
corporate authorities its recommendation that the development concept plan
either be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be approved.
The failure of the plan commission to act within twenty one (21) days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation
for the approval of the development concept plan as submitted.
   F.   Action By Corporate Authorities: Within sixty (60) days following the
receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the corporate authorities shall either deny the application for
approval of the development concept plan; shall remand it back to the plan
commission for further consideration of specified matters; or shall, by
resolution duly adopted, approve the development concept plan, with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
such approval, and refer the matter to the plan commission for processing of
the final plan in accordance with subsection 12-17B-7F of this article.
   G.   Failure Of Corporate Authorities To Act: The failure of the corporate
authorities to act within sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying approval of the
development concept plan.
   H.   Coordination With Subdivision Ordinance: When a subdivision of land
subject to the subdivision ordinance is proposed in connection with a planned
development, review of the tentative plat of the proposed subdivision shall be
carried out simultaneously with review of the development concept plan. (Ord.
05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-6: OPTIONAL SUBMISSION OF FINAL PLAN:
The applicant may, at his option, submit a final plan for the proposed planned
development pursuant to the requirements of section
12-17B-7 of this article simultaneously with the submission of the development
concept plan pursuant to the requirements of section
12-17B-5 of this article. In such case, the applicant shall comply with all
provisions of this article. The plan commission and the corporate authorities
shall consider such plans simultaneously and shall grant or deny final plan
approval in accordance with the provisions of section
12-17B-7 of this article. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-7: FINAL PLAN:
   A.   Purpose: The final plan is intended to particularize, refine and
implement the development concept plan and to serve as a complete, thorough and
permanent public record of the planned development and the manner in which it

the plan commission.
   D.   Coordination With Subdivision Ordinance: When a subdivision of land
subject to the subdivision ordinance is proposed in connection with a planned

carried out simultaneously with review of the final plan.
   E.   Phasing Of Final Plan Approval: An application for final plan approval
may include the entire area included in the approved development concept plan
or one or more phases, stages or units thereof; provided, however, that the
following matters must be addressed and provided in the first phase, stage or
unit submitted for final plan approval:
      1.   All public improvements required or proposed for the entire area
included in the approved development concept plan;
      2.   All open space required or proposed for the entire area included in
the approved development concept plan;
      3.   All land dedications required or proposed for the entire area
included in the approved development concept plan; and
      4.   The payment of all fees required by the village.

      1.   Evaluation: Within sixty (60) days following the filing of an
application for approval of a final plan, the plan commission shall, with such
aid and advice of such village staff and consultants as may be appropriate,
review and act on the plan. Such review shall consider:
         a.   Whether the final plan is in substantial conformity with the
approved development concept plan;
         b.   The merit or lack of merit of any departure of the final plan
from substantial conformity with the approved development concept plan;
         c.   Whether the final plan complies with any and all conditions
imposed by approval of the development concept plan; and
         d.   Whether the final plan complies with the provisions of this
section and all other applicable federal, state and village codes, ordinances,
and regulations.
      2.   Approval Based On Substantial Conformity: If the plan commission
finds substantial conformity between the final plan and the approved
development concept plan and further finds the final plan to be in all other
respects complete and in compliance with any and all conditions imposed by
approval of the development concept plan and with the provisions of all
applicable federal, state, and village codes, ordinances and regulations, it
shall transmit the plan to the corporate authorities with its recommendation
that the corporate authorities approve the final plan, with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
approval.
      3.   Recommendation Of Denial: In any case where the plan commission
finds that the final plan is not in substantial conformity with the approved
development concept plan and does not merit approval, or in any case where it
requires modifications of a plan that are not accepted by the applicant, the
plan commission shall transmit the plan to the corporate authorities together
with its recommendation and specific reasons in support of its recommendation
that the final plan not be approved.
      4.   Failure To Act: The failure of the plan commission to act within the
sixty (60) day period specified in subsection F1 of this section, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation to the corporate authorities to approve the final plan as
submitted.

receipt of the recommendation of the plan commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the corporate authorities shall take action in accordance with
the following:

recommended approval of a final plan pursuant to subsection F2 of this section,
the corporate authorities shall, unless it specifically rejects one or more of

authorities may refer the final plan back to the plan commission for further
consideration of specified matters.
      4.   Conditions On Final Plan Approval: The approval of any final plan
may, in addition, be granted, with or without modifications and conditions to
be accepted by the applicant as a condition of approval.
      5.   Failure To Act: The failure of the corporate authorities to act

shall be deemed to be a decision denying final plan approval.
   H.   Recording Of Final Plan: When a final plan is approved, the village
clerk shall cause the final plan, or the portions thereof as are appropriate,
to be recorded with the office of the Cook County recorder of deeds.
   I.   Limitation On Final Plan Approval: Construction shall commence in
accordance with the approved final plan within one year after the approval of
such plan, or within such shorter time as may be established by the approved
development schedule. Failure to commence construction within such period
shall, unless an extension of time shall have been granted, upon formal request
of the applicant, by the corporate authorities, automatically render void the
final plan approval and all approvals of the planned development and all
permits based on such approvals.

upon proper application by the applicant, issue building and other permits to
the applicant for the development, construction and other work in the area
encompassed by the approved final plan; provided, however, that no permit shall
be issued unless the appropriate official is first satisfied that the
requirements of any applicable codes, ordinances, or regulations of the
village, have been satisfied. Building permits may, however, be withheld at the
discretion of the corporate authorities, or their designee, at any time it is
determined that the development of the planned development is not proceeding in
strict compliance with the approved final plan. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-8: STANDARDS FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS:
No special permit for a planned development shall be recommended or granted
unless and until the applicant shall establish that the proposed development
will meet each of the following standards:
   A.   Unified Ownership Required: The entire property proposed for the
planned development shall be in single ownership or under such unified control
as to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a unified whole. All
owners of the property shall be included as joint applicants on all
applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any
owner as to any tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owners and all
tracts.
   B.   Covenants And Restrictions To Be Enforceable By Village: All covenants,
deed restrictions, easements and similar restrictions to be recorded in
connection with the planned development shall provide that they may not be
modified, removed or released without the express consent of the corporate

well as by future landowners within the proposed development.
   C.   Public Open Space: Where the subject property is two (2) acres or more
in area, the corporate authorities may require that public grounds be

corporate authorities may require evidence that all requirements of village
ordinances pertaining to the designation of public grounds have been met as
respects the proposed planned development and in accordance with the
subdivision ordinance.
   D.   Common Open Space:
      1.   Amount, Location And Use: The failure of a planned development to
provide common open space shall be considered to be an indication that it has
not satisfied the objectives for which such developments may be approved
pursuant to this article. When common open space is provided in a planned
development, the amount and location of such open space shall be consistent
with its intended function as set forth in the application and planned
development plans. No such open space shall be used for the construction of any
structure or improvement except such structures and improvements as may be
approved in the final plan as appropriate to the intended leisure and
recreational uses for which such open space is intended.
      2.   Preservation: Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants or
dedication of development rights, shall be provided to prevent the subsequent
use of common open space for any use, structure, improvement or development
other than that shown on the approved final plan. The restrictions must be
permanent and not for a given period of years and must run with the land.
      3.   Ownership And Maintenance: The final plan shall include such
provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such open space and
improvements as are reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care,
conservation, maintenance and operation in accordance with predetermined
standards and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the village
if such open space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or are not
maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the planned
development or the village.
      4.   Property Owners' Association: When the requirements of this
subsection D are to be satisfied by the ownership or maintenance of such open
space or improvements by a property owners' association, such association shall
meet each of the following standards:
         a.   The bylaws and rules of the association and all declarations,
covenants and restrictions to be recorded must be approved as part of the final
plan prior to becoming effective. Each such document shall provide that it
shall not be amended in any manner that would result in it being in violation
of the requirements of subsection A of this section.
         b.   The association must be established and all covenants and
restrictions recorded prior to the sale of any property within the area of the
planned development designated to have the exclusive use of the proposed open
space or improvements.
         c.   The association must be responsible for casualty and liability
insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of the open space and improvements to be
deeded to it.
         d.   Membership in the association must be mandatory for each property
owner, and any successive owner, having a right to the use or enjoyment of such
open space or improvements.
         e.   Every property having a right to the use or enjoyment of such
open space or improvements must pay its pro rata share of the cost of the
association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association that
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with
statutes of the state of Illinois.
         f.   The association must have the right to adjust the assessment to
meet changed needs. The membership vote required to authorize such adjustment
shall not be fixed at more than fifty one percent (51%) of the members voting
on the issue.
         g.   The village must be given the right to enforce the covenants.
         h.   The village must be given the right, after ten (10) days' written
notice to the association, to perform any maintenance or repair work that the
association has neglected to perform, to assess the membership for such work
and to have a lien against the property of any member failing to pay such
assessment. For this purpose alone, the village shall have all the rights and
powers of the association and its governing body under the agreements and
declarations creating the association.
         i.   Drafts of all association documents shall be provided to the
village attorney for his or her review to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this subsection D4.
   E.   Landscaping And Perimeter Treatment: Any area of a planned development
not used for structures or circulation elements shall be landscaped or
otherwise improved. The perimeter of the planned development shall be treated
so as to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses by means such as provision
of compatible uses and structures; setbacks; screening; or natural or manmade
buffers. Every planned development shall provide a perimeter landscaped open
space along each of its boundaries; each such open space shall have a minimum
depth equal to the minimum applicable yard required in the district in which it
is located.
   F.   Private Streets: Private streets shall be permitted in a planned
development provided that:
      1.   Said streets shall be treated as public streets and rights of way
for purposes of all setbacks, yards and calculations;
      2.   Said streets shall be owned and maintained by a property owners'
association meeting the requirements set forth in subsection D4 of this
section; and
      3.   A covenant shall be recorded against the subject property
acknowledging that the village shall at no time be under any obligation to
provide maintenance for or accept dedication of said streets.
   G.   Utilities: All utility lines shall be installed underground.
   H.   Conditions On Planned Development Approvals: The approval of either a
development concept plan or a final plan may be conditioned on such matters as
the corporate authorities may find necessary to prevent or minimize any
possible adverse effects of the proposed planned development; or to ensure its
compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency with
the general purposes, goals and objectives of the village, and all relevant
village codes, ordinances, and regulations. Such conditions shall be expressly
set forth in the ordinance or resolution granting the approval in question.
Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this
article and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted
for the planned development.
   I.   Affidavit Of Compliance With Conditions; Fee: Whenever any planned
development approval granted pursuant to this article is made subject to
conditions or limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon
meeting such conditions, file an affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory
to the village attorney, with the village clerk so stating. Such affidavit
shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, to be fixed in each case by the
corporate authorities, or their designee, to recover the village's actual
direct cost of an inspection to verify that such conditions and limitations
have been met. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-9: CONTROLLING PROVISIONS:
Following final plan approval, in the event of an express conflict between the
provisions of the final plan and this article, the final plan shall control.
This article shall control in all other instances. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-10: INSPECTIONS DURING DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Inspections By Village: Following approval of the final plan of a
planned development, or any stage thereof, the appropriate village officials
shall, at least annually until the completion of development, review all
permits issued and construction undertaken and compare actual development with
the approved plans for development and with the approved development schedule.
   B.   Action By Village Officials: If a village official finds that
development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved schedule, or that
it fails in any other respect to comply with the final plan, the village
official shall immediately notify the village administrator of such fact and
may, if necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare or to prevent
further violation of this article and the final plan, issue an order stopping
any and all work on the planned development until such time as any
noncompliance is cured.
   C.   Action By Corporate Authorities: Within sixty (60) days following
notification by the village administrator, the corporate authorities shall
either:
      1.   Take such steps as it deems necessary to compel compliance with the
final plan; or
      2.   Require the owner or applicant to seek an adjustment to the final
plan as provided in section
12-17B-11 of this article. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-11: ADJUSTMENTS TO FINAL PLAN DURING DEVELOPMENT:
   A.   Minor Adjustments:
      1.   During the development of a planned development, the corporate
authorities, or their designee, may authorize minor adjustments to the final
plan when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or
engineering considerations first discovered during actual development. Such
minor adjustments shall be limited to the following:
         a.   Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures
by not more than five feet (5') or one-fourth (1/4) of the distance shown on
the approved final plan between such structure or structures and any other
structure or any vehicular circulation element or any boundary of the planned
development, whichever is less;
         b.   Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than
five feet (5') or one-fourth (1/4) of the distance shown on the approved final
plan between such circulation element and any structure, whichever is less;
         c.   Altering the location of any open space by not more than twenty
feet (20');
         d.   Altering any final grade by not more than ten percent (10%) of
the originally planned grade; and
         e.   Altering the location or type of landscaping elements.
      2.   Such minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent and
purpose of this article and the final plan as approved, shall be the minimum
necessary to overcome the particular difficulty and shall not be approved if
they would result in a violation of any standard or requirement of this
article.
   B.   Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to the final plan not authorized by
subsection A of this section shall be considered to be a major adjustment and
shall be granted only upon application to, and approval by, the corporate
authorities, by ordinance duly adopted. The corporate authorities may, by
ordinance duly adopted, grant approval for a major adjustment without a hearing
upon finding that any changes in the final plan as approved will be in
substantial conformity with said final plan. If the corporate authorities
determine that a major adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the
final plan as approved, then the corporate authorities may refer the request to
the plan commission for further hearing, review, and recommendation. (Ord. 05-
03, 1-18-2005)
12-17B-12: FINAL PLAN AMENDMENTS:
After completion of a planned development, an approved final plan may be
amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
standards and limitations provided in this article for approval of the planned
development. (Ord. 05-03, 1-18-2005)

this article shall be subject to a nonrefundable one hundred fifty dollar
($150.00) application and filing fee, the requirements of the village cost
recoveries ordinance, and the actual cost, as hereinafter defined, incurred by
the village in processing such application. The owner of the property which is
the subject of the application and, if different, the applicant, shall be
jointly and severally liable for the payment of said fee. By signing the
application, the owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such fee and to
consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to
ensure collection of any such fee, plus the costs of collection, which have not
been paid within thirty (30) days following the mailing of a written demand for
such payment to the owner at the address shown on the application. Any lien
filed pursuant to this subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by
statute for mortgages or mechanics' liens.
   B.   Recoverable Costs: For purposes of calculating the fee due pursuant to
subsection A of this section, the actual costs incurred by the village in
processing an application shall be deemed to consist of the following items of

      1.   Initial Payment And Escrow: Every application filed pursuant to this
article shall be accompanied by the required fee plus an additional amount for
recoverable costs as provided in subsection B of this section, to be deposited
in an application fee escrow. No interest shall be payable on any such escrow.
      2.   Charges Against Escrow: From the date of filing of any application
pursuant to this article, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the
actual costs, as hereinabove defined, of processing such application. The
corporate authorities, or their designee, shall, from time to time, draw funds
from the escrow account established for such application to pay such costs and
shall transfer such funds to the appropriate village accounts.
      3.   Additional Escrow Deposits: Should the corporate authorities, or
their designee, at any time determine that the escrow account established in
connection with any application is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay
the actual costs of processing such application, the applicant shall be
notified of that fact and shall be required to make an additional deposit in an
amount deemed sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and
until such additional amount is deposited by the applicant, the corporate
authorities, or their designee, may direct that processing of the application
shall be suspended or terminated.
      4.   Final Settlement: As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the corporate authorities, or their designee, shall
cause a final accounting to be made of the escrow deposits made in connection
with such application and the actual cost of processing such application and
shall make a final charge of such costs against such escrow deposits. A copy of
the accounting shall be provided to the owner and the applicant. If the amount
in the escrow account is insufficient to pay the total actual costs, a written
demand for payment of the balance due shall be mailed to the owner and the
applicant. If unused balance remains in the escrow account after paying the
total actual costs, it shall be returned to the applicant.
   D.   Condition Of All Applications, Approvals And Permits; Time Periods: No
application filed pursuant to this article shall be considered complete unless
and until all fees and deposits due pursuant to this section have been paid.
Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this article shall,
whether or not expressly so conditioned, be deemed to be conditioned upon
payment of fees as required by this section. Where this article provides that
the passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or a
recommendation for approval, time periods shall be tolled during any period of
nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue to run. The failure to fully pay any
such fee or deposit, when due, shall be grounds for refusing to process an
application and for denying or revoking any permit or approval sought or issued
with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid fee or deposit
relates.
   E.   Applications For Preliminary Consideration: Every application filed
pursuant to section
12-17B-4 of this article shall provide the following information:

resubmit a revised application once within thirty (30) days after the notice of
denial is sent without payment of an additional application fee. The village
shall have thirty (30) days to approve or deny the resubmitted application or
it is deemed approved, if the applicant has notified the village of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which notification may be submitted with the resubmitted application. Review of
a resubmitted application is limited to the deficiencies cited in the original
notice of denial. This subsection does not apply if a revised application is

wireless facilities shall be allowed if the collocations each involve
substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the
same type of structure. Each consolidated application shall provide all the
information required by this chapter for each small wireless facility at each
location. If such an application includes incomplete information for one (1) or
more small wireless facility collocations, or includes requests for small
wireless facilities that do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are
otherwise denied, the village may remove such collocation requests from the
application and treat them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued
for each collocation approved in a consolidated application.
      11.   Alternate Locations: If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the village may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed collocation.
The applicant shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has
the right to use the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the
alternate location imposes technical limits or additional material costs as
determined by the applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location
based on the foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence
in the form of a written certification, under oath, describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate
location from being utilized.

13-7-9: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Public Safety Technology: A wireless provider's operation of a small
wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a public
safety agency for public safety communications. A wireless provider must
install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause
unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications
equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR Part 22.970 through 47 CFR
Part 22.973 and 47 CFR Part 90.672 through 47 CFR Part 90.675. The burden to
establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall
timely deliver to the village all information necessary to demonstrate its
efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the code of federal
regulations sections cited above. Failure to remedy the interference as
required herein shall constitute a public nuisance and the small wireless
facility may be abated through the procedures for abatement of such nuisances
set forth in this code.
   B.   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any wireless
facility that:
      1.   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a
right of way;
      2.   Obstructs the legal use of right of way by utility users;
      3.   Violates non-discriminatory applicable codes;
      4.   Violates or conflicts with title 8, chapter 2 or title 13, or other
applicable regulations set forth in this code or otherwise adopted by the
village, except to the extent such chapters, sections or regulations may be
modified by the provisions of this chapter; or
      5.   Violates the federal Americans with disabilities act of 1990, 42
U.S.C. §12101 et seq.
   C.   Contractual Requirements: Wireless providers shall comply with all
requirements imposed by a contract between the village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles
and ground-mounted equipment located in the right of way.

      2.   A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the village
administrator or his or her designee to allow wireless facilities to be located
above-ground in an area where village ordinances or regulations prohibit or
restrict above-ground facilities if the wireless provider can establish that:
         a.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no
reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right of
way;
         b.   An above-ground wireless facility at the proposed location is
necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
         c.   An above-ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety hazard;
         d.   An above-ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies;
         e.   Space exists within the public right of way to accommodate the
above- ground wireless facility at the proposed location;
         f.   An above-ground wireless facility at the proposed location will
not create a safety hazard;
         g.   The above-ground wireless facility is located and designed in
such a way so as to minimize its visual impact on adjacent properties; and
         h.   In any historical area, that the above-ground wireless facility
will not detrimentally affect the historical nature of the area.

facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in
accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape architect.
Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous and coniferous planting
materials. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance
of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      4.   Future Undergrounding: The village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the village shall
either:
         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   F.   Collocation Limits:
      1.   Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric
supply zone of the pole.
      2.   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the national electric safety code as published
by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers.

historical landmarks and/or district in design and color.
   C.   Historic District Or Landmark Limitations:
      1.   Any stealth, concealment and design standards in a historic district
or on a historic landmark, including restrictions on a specific category of
utility poles, may not have the effect of prohibiting any provider's
technology. Such stealth, concealment and design measures shall not be
considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size
restrictions of a small wireless facility.
      2.   This section shall not be construed to limit the village's
enforcement of historic preservation in conformance with the requirements
adopted pursuant to the Illinois state agency historic resources preservation
act or the national historic preservation act of 1966, 54 U.S.C. §300101 et

For the purposes of this title, the following definitions are adopted:
ACT: The rivers, lakes, and streams act 1 , as amended.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the regulatory floodway that are permissible and
will be considered for permit insurance. The only uses that will be allowed are
as specified in subsection 14-3-6C of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in section
14-3-4 of this chapter.
BUILDING: A structure that is principally aboveground and is enclosed by walls
and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, manufactured home,
mobile home or prefabricated building. This term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than one

COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain; the uncompensated loss of natural floodplain. The uncompensated
loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off site floodwater elevations
and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A REGULATORY FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and the federal emergency management agency of a proposed
change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to this
chapter, gives assurances to the property owner that when an appropriate use is

through the structure given a specific upstream and downstream water surface
elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: A. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
   B.   Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be
required include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police
stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities,
major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations
or electrical transformers), and hazardous materials storage facilities
(chemicals, petrochemicals or hazardous or toxic substances).
   C.   Examples of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended
include: sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing

elevations at or below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood
elevation. Floodplains may also include detached special flood hazard areas,
ponding areas, etc. The floodplain is also known as the special flood hazard
area (SFHA). The floodplains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the
village of Berkeley that are subject to inundation by the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood. The SFHAs of the village are generally identified as such
on panel numbers 168, 169, and 307 of the countywide flood insurance rate map
of Cook County and prepared by the federal emergency management agency. The
SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the
village are generally identified as such on the countywide flood insurance rate
map of Cook County prepared by the federal emergency management agency.

frequency flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or
floodways as shown on an effective FHBM or FIRM.
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designated for use, with or without a
permanent foundation, when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other
similar vehicles placed on site for more than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MITIGATION: Includes those measures necessary to minimize the negative effects
which floodplain development activities might have on the public health, safety
and welfare. Examples of mitigation include compensatory storage, soil erosion
and sedimentation control and channel restoration.
NAVD: North American vertical datum of 1988. A reference surface set by the
national geodetic survey deduced from a continental adjustment of all existing
adjustments in 1988.
NATURAL: When used in reference to channels, means those channels formed by the
existing surface topography of the earth prior to changes made by man. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flow over soil and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is
reestablished. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural
conditions by man through regrading and revegetation.
ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK (OHWM): The point on the bank or shore up to which the
presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark, such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation or other easily recognized
characteristics.
PUBLIC FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT: A flood control project which will be operated
and maintained by a public agency to reduce flood damages to existing buildings
and structures which includes a hydrologic and hydraulic study of the existing
and proposed conditions of the watershed. Nothing in this definition shall
preclude the design, engineering, construction or financing, in whole or in
part, of a flood control project by persons or parties who are not public
agencies.
PUBLICLY NAVIGABLE WATERS: All streams and lakes capable of being navigated by
watercraft.
REGISTERED LAND SURVEYOR: A land surveyor registered in the state of Illinois
under the Illinois professional land surveyor act of 1989 2 , as amended.
REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER: An engineer registered in the state of
Illinois under the professional engineering practice act of 1989 3 , as
amended.
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion
of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/
OWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing and anticipated future
100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than 0.1 foot increase in stage
due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent
(10%) increase in velocities. The regulatory floodways are designated for the
west branch of the DuPage River on the regulatory flood insurance rate map
prepared by the federal emergency management agency and shown on panel numbers
168, 169, and 307 of the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County
dated August 19, 2008, and panel numbers 103, 201, 106, and 204 of the
countywide flood insurance rate map of DuPage County dated December 16, 2004.
The regulatory floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook or DuPage
County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village that
may be annexed into the village are designated on panel numbers 168, 169, and
307 of the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County dated August 19,
2008, and panel numbers 103, 201, 106, and 204 of the countywide flood
insurance rate map of DuPage County dated December 16, 2004, prepared by the
federal emergency management agency. To locate the regulatory floodway boundary
on any site, the regulatory floodway boundary should be scaled off the
regulatory floodway map and located on the site plan, using reference marks
common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact
location of the regulatory floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for
the interpretation.
REPAIR, REMODELING OR MAINTENANCE: Development activities which do not result
in any increases in the outside dimensions of a building or any changes to the
dimensions of a structure.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty five
percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damaged occurred.
RETENTION/DETENTION FACILITY: A retention facility stores stormwater runoff
without a gravity release. A detention facility provides for the storage of
stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a
flood or storm.
RIVERINE SFHA: Any SFHA subject to flooding from a river, creek, intermittent
stream, ditch, on stream lake system or any other identified channel. This term
does not include areas subject to flooding from lakes, ponding areas, areas of
sheet flow or other areas not subject to overbank flooding.
RUNOFF: The water derived from melting snow or rain falling on the land
surface, flowing over the surface of the ground or collected in channels or
conduits.
SEDIMENTATION: The processes that deposit soils, debris and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in bodies of water or watercourses.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): Any base flood area subject to flooding from

the ground, including the construction, reconstruction or replacement of a
building or any addition to a building; installing a manufactured home on a
site; preparing a site for a manufactured home; or installing a trailer on a
site for more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage during the life of the building equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and
materials must be included in this determination. The term includes repetitive
loss buildings.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: A. Any repairs, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
      1.   Before the improvement or repair is started; or
      2.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred.
   B.   For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.
         C. The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for the improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of

14-3-3: DUTIES OF VILLAGE ENGINEER:
   A.   The village engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in subsection B of this section. To fulfill those duties, the
village engineer first should use the criteria listed in section
14-3-4, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine whether the
development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined
that a site is located within a floodplain, the village engineer must determine
whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway or
an SFHA or a floodplain on which no floodway has been identified. If the site
is within a flood fringe, the village engineer shall require that the minimum
requirements of section
14-3-5 of this chapter be met. If the site is within a floodway, the village
engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section
14-3-6 of this chapter be met. If the site is located within an SFHA or a
floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the
village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section
14-3-7 of this chapter be met.
   B.   In addition, the general requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the
requirements of section
14-3-5,
14-3-6 or
14-3-7 of this chapter. The village engineer shall assure that all subdivision
proposals shall meet the requirements of section
14-3-9 of this chapter.
   C.   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the village engineer
shall review the requirements of section
14-3-10 of this chapter to make sure that they are met. In addition, the
village engineer shall complete all notification requirements.
   D.   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in
this chapter, the village engineer may take any and all actions as outlined in
section
14-3-12 of this chapter.
   E.   The village engineer shall be responsible for the general
administration and enforcement of this chapter, which shall include the
following:
      1.   Determining Floodplain Designation: Check all new development sites
to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they
are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or
floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which drains more
than one square mile.
      2.   Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a
floodway or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted
which drains more than one square mile, then the permit shall be referred to a
registered professional engineer (PE) under the employ or contract of the
village for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of
section
14-3-6 of this chapter. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state
in writing that the development meets the requirements of section
14-3-6 of this chapter.
      3.   Dam Safety Requirements: Ensure that an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit
has been issued or a letter indicating that no dam safety permit is required if
the proposed development activity includes construction of a "dam" as defined
in section
14-3-2 of this chapter. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts
or impoundment structures.
      4.   Other Permit Requirements: Ensure that any and all required federal,
state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
      5.   Plan Review And Permit Issuance: Ensure that all development
activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the
requirements of this chapter and issue a floodplain development permit in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of the
village when the development meets the conditions of this chapter.
      6.   Inspection Review: Inspect all development projects before, during
and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to
ensure that they comply with the provisions of this chapter.
      7.   Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit
files an elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building or the
elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a
floodproofing certificate for all buildings subject to section
14-3-8 of this chapter for public inspection and provide copies of the same.
      8.   Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and regulatory floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map amendment and as built elevation and floodproofing or elevation
and floodproofing certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this
chapter.
      9.   State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been
granted by the Illinois office of water resources for all development projects
subject to sections
14-3-6 and
14-3-7 of this chapter unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to
the village. Upon acceptance of this chapter by IDNR/OWR and FEMA,
responsibility is hereby delegated to the village as per 17 Illinois
administrative code 3708 for construction in the regulatory floodway and
floodplain when floodways have not been defined in sections
14-3-6 and
14-3-7 of this chapter. However, the following review approvals were not
delegated to the village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
         a.   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
         b.   Department of transportation IDNR/OWR projects, dams or
impoundment structures as defined in subsection
14-3-2 of this chapter, definition of "dam", and all other state, federal or
local units of government projects, including projects of the village and
county except for those projects meeting the requirements of subsection 14-3-6H
of this chapter;
         c.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile per subsection 14-3-6D5 of this chapter;
         d.   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection 14-
3-6D4 of this chapter;
         e.   Alternative transaction sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensation storage as indicated in subsections 14-3-6D1, D2 and D8 of this
chapter;
         f.   Permit issuance of structures within or over publicly navigable
rivers, lakes and streams;
         g.   Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations;
and
         h.   Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist.
      10.   Cooperation With Other Agencies: Cooperate with state and federal
floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency
flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter.
Submit data to IDNR/OWR and the federal emergency management agency for
proposed revisions of a regulatory map. Submit reports as required for the
national flood insurance program. Notify the federal emergency management
agency of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
      11.   Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as
necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject,
however, to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter
changes. (2016 Code)
14-3-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
   A.   This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance
study for the village. If a base flood elevation for the 100-year frequency
flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection
standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois
state water survey's floodplain information repository. When a party disagrees
with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study
needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and
FEMA.
   B.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs
shall be as delineated in the 100-year flood profiles in the countywide FIS for
Cook County dated August 19, 2008, prepared by the federal emergency management
agency.
   C.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an AH zone or AO zone shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the village.
   D.   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the
remaining SFHAs delineated as an A zone on the flood insurance rate map of the
village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois
state water survey floodplain information repository. When no base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model,
such as HEC-2, WSP-2 or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in
the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrological model, such as HEC-
1, TR-20 or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by
the United States geological survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood
flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the
watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along
any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall
be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval; once approved, it must be submitted to
the Illinois state water survey floodplain information repository for filing.
For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of
record plus three feet (3') unless calculated by a detailed engineering study
and approved by the Illinois state water survey. (2016 Code)
14-3-5: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
   A.   Development Restricted; Compliance Required: Development in and/or
filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation and compensatory
storage and other provisions of this chapter are met. No use will be permitted
which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems.
Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of
this section along with the requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter.
   B.   Development Permit Requirements:
      1.   Permit Required: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without
first obtaining a development permit from the building official.
      2.   Application For Permit: An application for a development permit
shall be made on a form provided by the building official. The application
shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property
line dimensions and the legal description for the property and sealed by a
licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in
MSL, NAVD 88 and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the
location and dimensions of all buildings, the elevation of the lowest flood
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans, and the development will be subject to the requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter.
      3.   Review Of Application: Upon receipt of a development permit
application, the building official shall compare the elevation of the site to
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located
on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as
of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA
and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building
official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that the ground elevation existed prior to
the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
      4.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan: A soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan
shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the
temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate
their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final
stabilization and revegetation measures and the identification of a responsible
party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
      5.   Additional Required Permits: The building official shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state
and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be
required for this type of activity. The building official shall not issue a
permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained.
   C.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
   D.   Using Fill: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
   E.   Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (2016 Code)
14-3-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
   A.   Scope; General Requirements: This section applies to proposed
development, redevelopment, site modification or building modification within a
regulatory floodway. The regulatory floodway shall be delineated on the

facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses.
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls.
      4.   Underground and overhead utilities.
      5.   Recreational facilities, such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any 1
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows and including open
air pavilions.
      6.   Detached garages, storage sheds or other nonhabitable accessory
structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block
flood flows or reduce floodway storage.
      7.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto.
      8.   Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where the depth of
flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and
aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation.
      9.   Regulatory floodway regrading without fill to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a watercourse.
      10.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing
structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the
structure.
      11.   In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or
repairs made to a building that are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of
the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which do
not increase the outside dimensions of the building.
      12.   Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase
the building's footprint and are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the building.
   D.   Construction Of Appropriate Use: Within the regulatory floodway as
identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the
construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible; provided,
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation
criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure
meets the protection requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter:
      1.   Preservation Of Flood Conveyance To Not Increase Flood Stages
Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on
stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following facts shall be taken into consideration:
         a.   Regulatory floodway conveyance, two-thirds (2/3):
            K = 1.486 AR/n
            Where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area
of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter
(see Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New
York).
         b.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a record maintenance agreement with the federal,
state or local unit of government can assure that the proposed conditions will
be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a
nonvegetative land cover.
         c.   A transition section shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            (1)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expend no faster than at a rate of one
foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
            (2)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's
length.
            (3)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction,
a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of
stream length shall be used.
            (4)   Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            (5)   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      2.   Preservation Of Floodway Storage To Not Increase Downstream
Flooding: Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume
of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a
reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All
regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory
flood storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced
above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory
storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the
applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of
flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is
hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway
surface area as a result of a floodway modification unless such modification is
necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure.
      3.   Preservation Of Floodway Velocities To Not Increase Stream Erosion
Or Flood Heights: For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of
bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased
at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by
the use of riprap or other design measures.
      4.   Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway
Approaches:
         a.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks),
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/
OWR, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver.
         b.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section
14-3-4 of this chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/FHWA
"Hydraulic Chart For The Selection Of Highway Culverts". Bridges must be
analyzed using the U.S. DOT/"Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics Of
Bridge Waterways" calculation procedures.
         c.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated per subsection D2 of
this section.
         d.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection D3 of this
section.
         e.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
         f.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by
subsection C of this section.
         g.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per subsection D8 of this section.
      5.   Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And
Approach Roads:
         a.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event if the existing structure is not a source of flood
damage.
         b.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         c.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a
source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance
with IDNR/OWR rules, 17 Illinois administrative code 3708 (floodway
construction in northeastern Illinois), and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review
and concurrence before a permit is issued.
      6.   On Stream Structures Built For Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any
increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot, when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver for any
structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal
or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in subsection
14-3-2 of this chapter, definition of "dam", shall meet the permit requirements
of 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (construction and maintenance of dams).
If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to
accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention;
         b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish
species which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning;
         c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin;
         d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
         e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      7.   Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial
Structures: If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
      8.   Excavation In Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of
bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of
existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance
for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the
excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless
an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations
or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same
efficiency:
         a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
         b.   When water is flowing from a wider section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1')
horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length; and
         c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used.
         d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      9.   Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel
modification, it shall be demonstrated that:
         a.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would
accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body
of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization,
floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the establishment of a
stream side buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if
the purpose is to restore natural conditions and to improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
         b.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification, and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         c.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
            (1)   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design where practical.
            (2)   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            (3)   One sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of stream side (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            (4)   Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is
essential for the construction of the channel.
            (5)   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical wherever practicable.
Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred
materials. Artificial materials, such as concrete, gabions or construction
rubble, should be avoided unless there are not practicable alternatives.
            (6)   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to the establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            (7)   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity, such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established
where appropriate.
            (8)   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            (9)   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry, and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to the
diversion of water into the new channel.
            (10)   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            (11)   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
         d.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
section.
      10.   Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      11.   Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for the erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation
control measures shall be employed, consistent with the following criteria:
         a.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time that
the soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior
to the initiation of the improvements.
         b.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to
denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after the final grade is reached on any
portion of the site and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not
be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
         c.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment basins.
         d.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in
width shall be preserved and/or reestablished where possible along existing
channels (subsection D16 of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels
shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where
necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels
shall be restabilized immediately.
         e.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed
and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban Soil
Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois", 1988, also known as the "Green
Book", and "Standards And Specifications For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control"
(IEPA, 1987).
      12.   Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      13.   General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
         a.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory
floodway study, referenced in section
14-3-4 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If
the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR
shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
         b.   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         c.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, or modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
(5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      14.   Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA
all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by IDNR/
OWR until as built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA
and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall
take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and
IDNR/OWR.
      15.   Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall
be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer.
      16.   Construction Within Twenty Five Feet Of Channel:
         a.   For all activities in the floodway involving construction within
twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
            (1)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within
at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
            (2)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during
the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon the completion of construction.
            (3)   The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the
buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided when necessary
for stream maintenance purposes.
         b.   After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may
proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an
appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is
changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway
map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the
as built plans.
   E.   State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their
review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
      1.   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due
to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection D4 of this section.
      2.   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile pursuant to subsection D5 of this
section.
      3.   IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections D1, D2 and D8 of this
section.
      4.   IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction
any department projects, dams (as defined in section
14-3-2 of this chapter), and all other state, federal or local units of
government projects, including projects of the municipality or county.
   F.   Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/4.9 et seq., as amended. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/
OWR has delegated this responsibility to the village.
   G.   Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a "dam", as defined in section
14-3-2 of this chapter, per 17 Illinois administrative code 3702 (construction
and maintenance of dams), shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to
the start of construction of a dam. If the village engineer finds a dam that
does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the village engineer shall immediately notify
the dam safety section of IDNR/OWR. If the village engineer finds a dam which
is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village engineer shall immediately
notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, the dam safety section in Springfield
and the Illinois emergency management agency (EMA).
   H.   Activities Not Requiring Registered Professional Engineer Review: The
following activities may be permitted without a registered professional
engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of
this chapter, including the mitigation requirements:
      1.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
         a.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or
         b.   Require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway;
or
         c.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe
or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing
streambed; and
         d.   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
      2.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
         a.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope; and
         b.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
         c.   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall
location.
      3.   Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences),
properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade.
      4.   Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that:
         a.   Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length.
         b.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
         c.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area
of the stream channel or bank of the lake.
         d.   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials, such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions, should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
      5.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
         a.   The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above natural grade.
         b.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
         c.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two
feet (2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
         d.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized
as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction.
         e.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after authorization. (2016 Code)
14-3-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WITH UNIDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS:
   A.   Development Restrictions: In SFHAs or floodplains where no floodways
have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations
have been established by FEMA and draining more than a square mile, no
development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated cases and structures,
shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the
floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation.
   B.   Development Permit Requirements:
      1.   Permit Required: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body
not exempted by state law shall commence any development in an SFHA or
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the building
official.
      2.   Application For Permit: Application for a development permit shall
be made on a form provided by the building official. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions; existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor;
the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and
the elevation at the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed
buildings subject to the requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter. The application for a development permit shall also
include the following information:
         a.   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose and
intended use.
         b.   Site location (including legal description) of the property,
drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is
proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area.
         c.   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of the activity.
         d.   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided, which include
as a minimum:
            (1)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, the name of
the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site,
graphic or numerical scale and north arrow;
            (2)   A plan view of the project and engineering study, each
showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (NAVD 88), adjacent property
lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, the distance between
the proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is
near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and
orientation of cross sections, north arrow and a graphical or numerical scale;
            (3)   Cross section views of the project and engineering study,
each showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions
of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal
water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood
elevation and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and
            (4)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of the final stabilization and revegetation measures and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
         e.   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted,
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection C of this
section.
         f.   Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
      3.   Elevation Of Site: Based on the best available existing data
according to the Illinois state water survey's floodplain information
repository, the village engineer shall compare the elevation of the sites to
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation
information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the
elevation according to subsection 14-3-4D of this chapter. Any development
located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood
elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not
in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
identification.
      4.   Additional Required Permits: The building official shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state
and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be
required for this type of activity. The building official shall not issue the
development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have
been obtained.
   C.   Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA where a
floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter.
   D.   Undetermined Floodways: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway
has not been determined, the following standards shall apply:
      1.   The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in
writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the
project meets the engineering requirements of subsections 14-3-6D1 through D12
of this chapter for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of
subsection 14-3-4D of this chapter. As an alternative, the developer should
have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that
engineering study to IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon
acceptance of their floodway by the department, the developer shall then
demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section
14-3-6 of this chapter for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be
defined according to section
14-3-2 of this chapter, definition of "regulatory floodway".
      2.   A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first
obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is not
required from IDNR/OWR.
      3.   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated
permit responsibility to the village (per 17 Ill. adm. code part 3708), for
regulatory floodways, per IDNR/OWR statewide permit entitled "Construction In
Floodplains With No Designated Floodways In Northeastern Illinois".
      4.   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
"dam", as defined in section
14-3-2 of this chapter, or an on stream structure to impound water shall obtain
an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter indicating that a permit is not
required prior to the start of the construction of a dam. If the village
engineer finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the village
engineer shall immediately notify the dam safety section of IDNR/OWR. If the
village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the
village engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois
emergency management agency (EMA) and IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, in
Springfield.
      5.   The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review or the calculation of a base flood elevation and
regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of
this chapter.
         a.   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            (1)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations;
or
            (2)   Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the
floodway; or
            (3)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet (3') below the existing
streambed; and
            (4)   In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are
placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch
debris.
         b.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
            (1)   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope; and
            (2)   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and
            (3)   Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the
outfall location.
         c.   Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that:
            (1)   Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length or two
(2) cubic yards per linear foot of streambed.
            (2)   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of the
bank.
            (3)   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional
area of the stream channel by more than ten percent (10%).
            (4)   Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the
preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel
velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative
stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials.
Artificial materials, such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions, should
be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
         d.   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            (1)   The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above the natural
grade.
            (2)   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing
up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile
or outfall invert.
            (3)   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet (2') below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall
be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
            (4)   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction.
            (5)   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed
within one year after authorization.
         e.   The construction of light poles, signposts and similar
structures.
         f.   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields
(excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade.
         g.   The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures,
such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports, built at or below the
existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of floodwaters.
         h.   The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding
seventy (70) square feet in size nor ten feet (10') in any one dimension (e.g.,
animal shelters and toolsheds).
         i.   The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not
increase the first floor area by more than twenty percent (20%), which are
located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building and which
do extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the
flow of floodwaters.
         j.   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
            (1)   The affected length of stream is less than one thousand feet
(1,000');
            (2)   The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural
stream channels; or
            (3)   The cross sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to
that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.
      6.   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
   E.   Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. (2016 Code)
14-3-8: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS:
In addition to the requirements found in sections
14-3-5,
14-3-6 and
14-3-7 of this chapter for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways
and SFHAs or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (zones A, AO,
AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements
shall be met:
   A.   Public health standards.
   B.   No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE.
   C.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer lines
and on site waste disposal systems may be permitted; provided, that all
manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
   D.   For all projects involving channel modification, fill or stream
maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse
shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities
in writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the
alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
   E.   All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as an
SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection
elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway
shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in
section
14-3-6 of this chapter. These building protection criteria apply to the
following situations:
      1.   Construction or placement of a new building;
      2.   A structural alteration to an existing building that either
increases the first floor area by more than twenty percent (20%) or the
building's market value by more than fifty percent (50%);
      3.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply
to returning a mobile home to the same site that it lawfully occupied before it
was removed to avoid flood damage; and
      4.   Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days.
This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following
methods.
   F.   A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be
constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following:
      1.   The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood
protection elevation. The flood protection elevation shall be one foot (1')
above the base flood elevation.
      2.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot (1')
deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet (10') beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation.
The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the
ten foot (10') minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an
alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic
pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill
shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto
neighboring properties.
   G.   A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance
with the following:
      1.   The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space,
stilts, piles, walls or other foundation that is permanently open to
floodwaters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than
one foot (1') above grade and consist of a minimum of two (2) openings. The
openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch of every
one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood
elevation.
      2.   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned
in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure
to known hydrodynamic forces, such as current, waves, ice and floating debris.
      3.   All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed
of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement)
and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing and air conditioning
equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the flood protection
elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible
pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood
protection elevation.
      4.   No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for
storage of items or materials.
      5.   Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for
more than one hundred eighty (180) days shall be elevated to or above the flood
protection elevation and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or
lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the rules and
regulations for the Illinois mobile home tiedown act 1 , as amended, issued
pursuant to 77 Illinois administrative code 870.
   H.   Only a nonresidential building may be structurally floodproofed (in
lieu of elevation); provided, that a registered professional engineer shall
certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the
flood protection elevation and the structure and attendant utility facilities
are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account flood
velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the
effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures
shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity. (Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection.)
   I.   Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in
use but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A nonconforming
structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or manmade disaster may
be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its market value
before it was damaged, in which case, it shall conform to this chapter. (2016
Code)

14-3-9: OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The board of trustees shall take into account flood hazards to the
extent that they are known in all official actions related to land management,
use and development.
   B.   New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements and
planned unit developments (PUDs) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure
that the proposed developments are consistent with sections
14-3-5,
14-3-6,
14-3-7 and
14-3-8 of this chapter and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans
for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit developments (PUDs)
shall include a signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the
plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface waters in
accordance with the plat act 1 , as amended.
   C.   Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer
parks, planned unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home
parks and subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this information is not
available from an existing study filed with the Illinois state water survey,
the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or
100-year frequency flood elevation per subsection 14-3-4D of this chapter and
the floodway delineation per the definition of "regulatory floodway" in section
14-3-2 of this chapter and submitting it to the state water survey and IDNR/OWR
for review and approval as best available regulatory data.
   D.   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located
and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and
channels. Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or
other public grounds.
   E.   The board of trustees shall not approve any planned unit development
(PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such
agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (2016
Code)
 
Notes
1 1. 765 ILCS 205/2.
14-3-10: VARIANCES:
   A.   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a
"regulatory floodway", as defined in section
14-3-2 of this chapter. However, when a development proposal is located outside
of a regulatory floodway, and whenever the standards of this chapter place
undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to
the village engineer for a variance. The village engineer shall review the
applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
board of trustees.
   B.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing or repairs to streambeds and stream banks, roads, utilities or other
public facilities;
      6.   The provisions of subsections 14-3-5C and 14-3-7C of this chapter
shall still be met;
      7.   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;
      8.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general problem; and
      9.   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved, including existing stream uses.
   C.   The village engineer shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of section
14-3-8 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of these risks
and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.
(2016 Code)
14-3-11: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and specific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur, or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA
will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on
the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully hereunder. (2016 Code)
14-3-12: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
   A.   Violation: Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or
conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this
title.
   B.   Determination And Notice Of Violation: Upon due investigation, the
village engineer may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of
this chapter exists. The village engineer shall notify the owner in writing of
such violation.
   C.   Injunction And Penalty:
      1.   If the owner fails, after ten (10) days' notice, to correct the
violation, the village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   D.   Insurance Suspension: The village engineer shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and,
therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
   E.   Other Remedies: Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (2016
Code)
14-3-13: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinances,
easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever
imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (2016 Code)

   A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets to be dedicated to the public and all private streets shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to reasonable
circulation of traffic within the development and adjoining lands, to
topographical conditions, to runoff of stormwater, to public convenience and
safety, and in their appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the area to
be served. All traffic intersections and confluences must encourage safe and
efficient traffic flow.
   B.   Within this chapter, the design requirements for pavements, as well as
curbs and gutters and sidewalks, will be defined. Supplementary improvements,
such as sewer, water, lighting and landscaping, will be discussed in the
following chapters of this title. (2016 Code)
14-4-2: GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS; STREET CLASSIFICATIONS:
   A.   All street pavements within the village shall be constructed in
accordance with one or more of the following as they apply:
      1.   "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge Construction", state of
Illinois, department of transportation, current edition.
      2.   "Manual For Structural Design Of Portland Cement Concrete Pavement",
department of transportation, current edition.
      3.   "Manual Of Instruction For The Structural Design Of Bituminous
Pavements On Projects Involving MFT And FAUS Funds", department of
transportation, current edition.
   B.   Design requirements for the pavement will be related to the street
classification as set forth by the village engineer.
   C.   The classification of new streets as well as variations to street
classifications shown in table 1 of this section for a given street, must be
submitted to the village engineer for his review prior to submittal of the
preliminary plat to the plan commission.
   D.   Street classifications are defined as follows:
      1.   Arterial Streets: An arterial street is a federal, state, county or
township roadway linking consecutive municipalities, counties or townships. The
following streets are classified as arterial streets:
St. Charles Road.
      2.   Major Collector Streets: A major collector street is a municipal
roadway of considerable continuity that connects municipalities or various
sections of that municipality. The following streets are classified as major
collector streets:
   Reserved.
      3.   Local Collector Streets: A local collector street is a municipal
roadway that carries traffic from minor streets to major streets or arterials,
including principal entrance streets of residential developments. The following
streets are classified as local collector streets:
   Reserved.
      4.   Industrial/Business Service Streets: An industrial/business service
street is a municipal roadway bounded by property zoned industrial/business.
Industrial/business zoning on one side is sufficient for an industrial/business
service street classification.
      5.   Minor Multi-Family Residential Streets: A minor multi- family
residential street is a roadway that provides access to abutting property zoned
for multi-family. Multi-family zoning on one side is sufficient for the minor
multi-family classification.
      6.   Minor Single-Family Residential Streets: A minor single- family
residential street is a roadway that provides access to abutting property zoned
for single-family.
   E.   The pavement design and right of way chart (table 1 of this section) is
intended to show minimum right of way widths and the minimum design standards
for a particular street classification. If, in the opinion of the village
engineer, traffic use or geometric considerations for a road or a part of a
road warrant a greater right of way width, a wider pavement width and/or a
greater structural number than listed on the chart, the village engineer shall
submit his written reasons to the planning and zoning commission prior to the
approval of the preliminary plat. Variations to the requirements of table 1 of
this section shall be considered only as a variation of this chapter.

Note: The pavement diameter (back to back) of circular ended cul-de-sacs shall
be 100 feet and the ROW diameter shall be 130 feet. Cul-de-sacs shall have a
maximum length of 300 feet measured from the centerline of the intersecting
street to the center of the turnaround.
(2016 Code)
14-4-3: PAVEMENT WIDTH:
All new streets, either public or private, within the corporate limits of the
village proposed after the effective date hereof shall be improved with roadway
paving and bordered by portland cement concrete curbs, in accordance with the
pavement design and right of way chart in section
14-4-2, table 1 of this chapter. Driveways to individual residential buildings
do not require curb and gutter or concrete barrier curb. Driveways to all other
buildings require combination concrete curb and gutter or concrete barrier
curb. (2016 Code)
14-4-4: PAVEMENT DESIGN:
   A.   All pavement shall be designed in accordance with the previously
referenced standards and manuals of the department of transportation. The
design thickness shall be dependent on the soil support value and projected
traffic factor. However, in no case shall structural numbers be less than those
shown in section
14-4-2, table 1 of this chapter.
   B.   All subgrade material shall have a minimum Illinois bearing ratio (IBR)
of 2.5. Subgrade material having an IBR less than 2.5 shall be removed and
replaced with a suitable fill material, or the pavement must be designed to
compensate for the soil conditions. The soil support IBR values selected for
use by the designer shall represent a minimum value for the soil to be used.
   C.   At the request of the village engineer, a copy of all design
assumptions and computations on which the proposed design is based shall be
submitted. (2016 Code)
14-4-5: MATERIAL TESTING:
   A.   The requirements of this chapter shall be applicable where deemed
necessary by the village engineer.
   B.   Concurrent with construction of any pavement within the corporate
limits of the village, the developer must furnish the village engineer with
copies of the certificates of testing from the Illinois department of
transportation, Cook County highway department, or from a testing laboratory
which has been prequalified by the Illinois department of transportation for
bituminous aggregate mixture, bituminous mixture, class I and pozzolanic base
course, type A as follows:
      1.   Proportioning tests: Minimum of one plant inspection per day is

the contractor and village jointly. Any defects or leaks shall be corrected by
the contractor.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to reexcavate the pipe at
his expense if the system fails to meet the requirements of the test.
      3.   A hydrostatic pressure of one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square
inch shall be applied for the testing of the water main, valves, fittings and
fire hydrants. The duration of the test shall be for a period of not less than
two (2) hours. The section of water main shall pass if the pressure loss in the
pipe is not greater than 7.5 pounds per square inch during the test.
   B.   Procedure For Test: Each section of pipe to be tested, as determined by
the village engineer, shall be slowly filled with water, and the specified test
pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in a
satisfactory manner. The pump pipe connection and all necessary apparatus
including gauges and meters shall be furnished by the contractor. Before
applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe.
To accomplish this, taps shall be made as necessary at points of highest
elevation and afterwards tightly plugged. Any cracked or defective pipes,
fittings, valves or hydrants discovered in consequence of this pressure test
shall be removed and replaced by the contractor with sound material, and the
test shall be repeated until satisfactory to the village engineer. Provisions
of AWWA C-600 and C-603, where applicable, shall apply. (2016 Code)
14-6-6: WATER MAIN LEAKAGE TESTING:
   A.   After completion of the pressure test, the village engineer may require
a leakage test to be conducted to determine the quantity of water lost by
leakage under the specified test pressure. "Test pressure" is defined as the
maximum operating pressure of the section under test and is based on the
elevation of the lowest point in the line or section under test corrected to
the elevation of the test gauge. Applicable provisions of AWWA C-600 and C-603
shall apply. Duration of each leakage test shall be a minimum of one hour in
addition to the pressure test period.
   B.   Allowable leakage in gallons per hour for a cast iron water main shall
not be greater than that determined by the formula:
 
L = ND P
    3,700
 
for mechanical joints; or
 
L = ND P
    1,850
 
for caulked bell and spigot joints.
Note:
L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour.
N = Number of joints in the length of the pipeline tested.
D = Nominal diameter of the pipe in inches.
P = Average test pressure during leakage test in pounds per square inch gauge.
Tables of allowable leakage and basis of allowable leakage can be found in
table 4 of this section for cast iron water main.
Allowable leakage for asbestos cement water pipe shall conform to provisions of
AWWA C-603. Allowable leakage per one hundred (100) couplings based on one
hundred fifty (150) psi pressure represents a leakage of thirty (30) gpd per
mile of pipe per inch of diameter for pipe in thirteen foot (13') lengths. A
table showing the allowable leakage is provided in table 4 of this section.
   C.   "Leakage" is defined as the quantity of water to be supplied in the
newly laid pipe or any valved section under test which is necessary to maintain
the specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water
and the air expelled.
   D.   Flanged pipe shall be "bottle tight".
   E.   In no case shall the leakage exceed the greater of either three
thousand (3,000) gallons per day per mile of water main or three percent (3%)
of total supplied water.

(2016 Code)
14-6-7: PRELIMINARY FLUSHING:
Prior to chlorination, the main shall be flushed as thoroughly as possible with
the water pressure and outlets available. Flushing shall be done after the
pressure test is made. It must be understood that such flushing removes only
the lighter solids and cannot be relied upon to remove heavy material allowed
to get into the main during laying. If no hydrant is installed at the end of
the main, a tap should be provided large enough to effect a velocity in the
main of at least 2.5 feet per second. (2016 Code)
14-6-8: STERILIZATION:
   A.   The preferred point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be
at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved section of it and
through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid pipe. The water
injector for delivering the chlorine bearing water into the pipe should be
supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow
into the pipeline extension. In a new system, application of chlorine may be
made at the pumping station, the elevated tank, the standpipe or the reservoir.
When properly cleaned first, these units are thus chlorinated adequately.
   B.   Water from the existing distribution system or other source of supply
shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline during
the application of chlorine. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be in such
proportion to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine applied to
the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least forty (40) to fifty
(50) ppm, or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period. A
convenient method of determining the rate of flow of line full of water and
measure the rate of discharge at a hydrant with a Pitot tube. Great flexibility
is made possible by providing a series of orifices to give good gauge readings
at high and low flows.
   C.   Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in the
line being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water.
   D.   Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough to destroy all
spore forming bacteria. This retention period should be at least twenty four
(24) hours. After the chlorine treated water has been retained for the required
time, the chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other representative
points should be at least ten (10) ppm.
   E.   In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other
appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the
chlorinating agent. (2016 Code)
14-6-9: FINAL FLUSHING AND TESTING:
   A.   Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed
from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the replacement water,
throughout its length, shall, upon test, be approved as safe water by the
department of public works. This quality of water delivered by the new main
should continue for a period of at least two (2) full days as demonstrated by
laboratory examination of samples taken from a tap located and installed in
such a way as to prevent outside contamination. Samples should never be taken
from an unsterilized hose or from a fire hydrant because such samples seldom
meet current bacteriological standards.
   B.   Should the initial treatment fail to result in the conditions
specified, the chlorination procedure shall be repeated until such results are
obtained.
   C.   Three-fourths inch (3/4") bronze corporation cocks shall be installed
in all water mains at intervals not exceeding one thousand feet (1,000').
   D.   The contractor must notify the engineering department at least twenty
four (24) hours in advance to arrange for appropriate pressure testing and
water samplings. The contractor is to provide the engineering department with
sampling bottles at the time of sampling. All samples will be sent to a state
of Illinois approved testing lab for analysis. (2016 Code)
14-6-10: COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REGULATIONS:
   A.   Water main design and construction shall in all respects be in accord
with the regulations of the bureau of public water supply, environmental
protection agency, state of Illinois. No construction shall commence until a
copy of a permit from this agency is filed with the village or that the village
received verification from this agency that a permit has been issued.
   B.   All water mains must be constructed according to the rules and
regulations of the Illinois department of public health regarding the
protection of water mains, water service lines and appurtenances from
contamination. (2016 Code)

   B.   Before commencing the sewer layout, the developer shall confer with the
village to determine the required size and grades for any trunk sewers
traversing the subdivision to fit the village's available or proposed
capacities required for existing or proposed developments both upstream and
downstream. Construction required to accommodate the subdivision or development
shall be submitted as part of the engineering plans. Sanitary sewers shall be
extended to the edge of the development along public rights of way and at other
points indicated by the village engineer.
   C.   All sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accord with the provisions
of division II and division III of the "Standard Specifications For Water And
Sewer Main Construction In Illinois", 1967, as modified and/or more
specifically defined herein. In case of conflict, the provisions of the

bell of the eye or tee and the necessary lengths of pipe.
   G.   1. If a lift station is part of the engineering design, it shall be
shown in plan elevation. Specifications for said lift station shall be
submitted with engineering plans. The lift station shall be of the dry well or
wet well type, and shall conform in all respects to the standards established
by the state of Illinois environmental protection agency and MSD. However,
every reasonable effort shall be made to avoid a lift station in engineering
design.
      2.   A separate source of power shall be furnished to each sewerage lift
station. This shall be from another electrical source provided by a separately
powered engine. Engine, enclosure and mounting shall be subject to approval by
the village engineer. An alarm shall be installed to the village master panel
in the event of failure at the lift station. (2016 Code)
14-7-3: ALLOWABLE MATERIALS:
   A.   Sewer Pipe:
      1.   Extra strength vitrified clay pipe (ESVCP) conforming to the
requirements of ASTM C-700.
      2.   Extra strength concrete sewer pipe (ESCSP) conforming to the

      5.   Thick walled PVC pipe shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D-
224.1 or D-3034, SDR 35. (SDR, or standard dimension ratio, is the ratio of the
pipe OD to the minimum wall thickness (SDR = D/t). The structural stability and
supporting strength of the pipe decrease with the increase of SDR.) The pipe
shall not exceed twenty feet (20') in laying length. Installation and selection
of bedding material shall conform to the requirements of ASTM specification D-
2321.
      6.   Truss pipe shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D2680-68T.
   B.   Pipe Joints:
      1.   Rubber Gasket Joints:
         a.   On tongue and groove type of pipe joints, rubber gaskets may be
used. The gasket shall consist of a special rubber ring of a size to fit snugly
over the tongue of each size pipe. The gasket shall be circular, elliptical or
of the manufacturer's special design cross section fabricated out of a special
composition or rubber specifically designed to resist the hardening action of
the sulphur compounds in sewage and to prevent disintegration from sewage or
water over long periods.
         b.   A ring shall be fitted over the tongue of each pipe to be laid at
its outer end. The tongue shall be inserted into the groove of the pipe
previously laid and the pipe pulled home.
         c.   Joints shall be made up in strict conformance with the
manufacturer's recommendations and directions. Rubber gasket material shall
conform to ASTM designation C425 type I or III (O-ring gasket).
      2.   Slip Joints:
         a.   Sections of cast iron pipe shall be connected by means of slip
joints consisting of bells cast integrally with the pipe, which have interior
angular recesses conforming with the shape and dimension of a rubber scaling
gasket, interior dimension of which is such that it will admit the insertion of
the spigot end of the joining pipe in such manner as to compress the gasket
tightly between the bell of the pipe and the inserted spigot, thus securing the
gasket and sealing the joint. Such slip joints shall be any one of the
following make or type or equal:
            (1)   Super bellites, supplied by James B. Clow And Son.
            (2)   Fastite, supplied by the American Cast Iron Pipe Company.
            (3)   Tyton, supplied by the U.S. Pipe And Foundry Company.
         b.   The lubricant used in conjunction with the slip joints shall be
that recommended by the suppliers or commercially processed animal fat or
vegetable shortening as approved by the engineer.
      3.   Thick Walled PVC Joint: The pipe joint shall conform to the
requirements of ASTM D-1869. The joint shall consist of a bell that is an
integral part of the pipe, stiffened to securely lock a solid cross sectional
rubber ring into position. A "home" mark shall be provided on the spigot end of
the pipe. The joint shall be able to withstand an internal hydrostatic pressure
of twenty five (25) psi for one hour, and leakage during that time shall be
considered a failure of test and joint.
      4.   Truss Pipe Joint: The pipe joint shall conform to the requirements
of ASTM D-2680.
   C.   Pipe Sleeves For Augering Or Tunneling:
      1.   Steel sleeves shall be three-eighths inch (3/8") thick of the
diameter specified, with a continuous, circular one-half inch (1/2") bead weld
and shall meet the requirements of ASTM A-120.
      2.   Concrete sleeves (alternate), if selected in place of the steel
sleeves specified in subsection C1 of this section, shall be reinforced
concrete pipe, tongue and groove type, conforming to the requirements of ASTM
C-76-57, table IV, class designation 3,000D. (2016 Code)
14-7-4: CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Excavation And Foundation:
      1.   The trench shall be excavated so that the flow line of the finished
sewer shall be at the depth and grade established by the village engineer. The
trench for the pipe shall be excavated at least twelve inches (12") wider than
the external diameter of the pipe. The width of the trench shall not exceed the
external diameter of the pipe by more than eighteen inches (18") at the top of
the pipe.
      2.   The pipe foundation shall be bedding material consisting of road
gravel or one-fourth inch (1/4") to three-fourths inch (3/4") crushed stone of
the depth shown on the plans. Where pipes with bells or hubs are used, cross
trenches shall be excavated to prevent nonuniform loading at the joints. The
cross trenches shall not be more than two inches (2") wider than the width of
the bell or hub.
      3.   If the excavation has been made deeper than necessary, the
foundation shall be brought to proper grade by the addition of well compacted
bedding material. Where a firm foundation is not encountered at the grade
established, due to soft, spongy or other unsuitable soil (unless other special
construction methods are called for on the plans or in the special provisions),
all such unsuitable soil under the pipe and for the width of the trench shall
be removed and replaced with well compacted bedding material.
      4.   Where it is necessary to tunnel, the width shall be the same as for
trenches. Where sheeting or shoring is necessary, this width shall be between
the faces of said sheeting or shoring. The ends of a tunnel shall be at a
distance equal to not less than the depth of the trench from the edge of
pavements where tunneling is done under pavements. Ends of tunnels under trees,
driveways, walks and other obstacles shall be of sufficient distance from them
to give ample protection to them. The sides and roof shall be braced
sufficiently to support roadways and other obstacles and to prevent caving,
bulging and settlement. It is preferred that open trenching be used in all
cases under pavements, walks and driveways except where they exist of concrete.
Where trenches are dug through pavement, walks and driveways, the contractor
shall provide substantial bridges over same so that traffic can be maintained
and access to occupied properties is assured. Access must be left to all fire
hydrants, valves and private drives at all times.
   B.   Sheeting And Bracing:
      1.   Sheeting and bracing shall be placed in the ditch, as may be
necessary for the safety of the work and public, for the protection of the
workers, adjacent properties, pavement or structures and for the proper
installation of the work. In any event, the minimum protection shall conform to
the recommendations in OSHA's "Safety And Health Standards For Construction". A
sandbox or trench shield may be used in place of sheeting as permitted by OSHA.
When close sheeting is used, it shall be driven so as to prevent adjacent soil
from entering the trench either below or through such sheeting.
      2.   Sheeting and/or bracing shall be progressively removed as the
backfill is placed in such a manner as to prevent the caving in of the sides of
the trench or excavation and to prevent damage to the work.
      3.   Sheeting which is placed for the protection of the public, adjacent
properties, pavement or structures shall not be removed until the backfill has
been placed and thoroughly compacted. While being drawn, all vacancies left by
the sheeting shall be carefully filled with sandfree silt, rammed into place,
puddled or otherwise firmly compacted.
   C.   Dewatering: Dewatering sufficient to maintain the water level at or
below the surface of trench bottom or base of the bedding course shall be
accomplished prior to pipe laying and jointing if not prior to excavation and
placing of the bedding as called for in other sections of the specifications or
special provisions. The dewatering operation, however accomplished, shall be
carried out so that it does not destroy or weaken the strength of the soil
under or alongside the trench. The normal water table shall be restored to its
natural level in such a manner as to not disturb the pipe and its foundation.
   D.   Pipe Laying:
      1.   The laying of pipes in finished trenches shall be started at the
outlet end with the spigot ends pointing in the direction of flow and shall
proceed toward the inlet end with pipes abutting and shall be true to line and
grade. The ends of the pipes shall be carefully cleaned before the pipes are
lowered into the trenches, and the pipes shall be lowered in such a manner that
unnecessary handling in the trench will be avoided. As each length of pipe is
laid, the mouth of the pipe shall be properly protected to prevent the entrance
of earth or the bedding material. The pipe shall be fitted and matched so that
when laid in the work, it will form a sewer with a smooth, uniform invert.
      2.   All jointing material shall be used in accordance with the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Each pipe shall be pushed or pulled as
tightly as possible to the section in place to ensure tight joints.
      3.   Sewer pipe shall not be dropped from trucks or cars. All pipe must
be lowered into the trench with suitable apparatus for this purpose. In no case
shall it be dropped or thrown.
   E.   Connections:
      1.   Connections of new sewers to existing sewers, when encountered in
construction, shall be made where ordered by the village engineer. Such
connections shall be made within a manhole, except for house and drain
connections. When connections are made with sewers carrying sewage or water,
special care must be taken that no part of the work is built under water. A
flume or dam must be installed and pumping maintained if necessary to keep the
new work dry until completed, and concrete or mortar has been set up.
      2.   Junctions for future sewer connections shall be bricked off at the
ends, or otherwise sealed off in a manner approved by the village engineer.
   F.   Wyes:
      1.   Wyes for existing or future lateral connection shall be inserted in
the sewer at the appropriate location as required by the village engineer. Wyes
shall be constructed so as to be an integral part of the main sewer pipe. Where
risers are to be provided, the wye bell shall be placed at the top of the pipe
perpendicular to the main sewer flow line. When risers are not required, the
wye bell shall be placed midway between the top of the pipe and the horizontal
centerline of the pipe at an angle of approximately forty five degrees (45°) to
sixty degrees (60°) with the upstream face of the pipe.
      2.   Wyes not put in service at the time of construction of the sewer
shall be plugged in such a manner as to be watertight and to facilitate future
removal without injury to the wye.
   G.   Backfilling:
      1.   The contractor shall not backfill sewers above the top of the pipe
until the sewer elevations, gradient, alignment and pipe joints have been made
available for checking by the village engineer or his representative.
      2.   All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled as soon as joints
have acquired a suitable degree of hardness. Concrete joints shall be protected
to prevent drying and cracking of the joints.
      3.   All sewer pipe, as soon as laid, shall have the space between the
pipe and the bottom and sides of the trench above the pipe foundation packed
full with sand or grade 9 gravel by hand and thoroughly tamped with a shovel,
hoe or light tamper, as soon as placed, to six inches (6") above the top pipe.
The filling shall be carried up evenly on both sides. Care shall be taken that
no rock, frozen material or other hard substances are placed in contact with
the pipe. In areas where clean, fine and dry sand is used for backfill, tamping
will not be required.
      4.   The trench shall be backfilled by using the material originally
excavated from the ditch (except for conditions hereafter defined) to a height
slightly above the original elevation of the ground. Backfilling shall not be
left unfinished more than three hundred feet (300') behind the completed
masonry or pipe work.
      5.   No heavy rock shall be dropped into the trench nor placed within
three feet (3') of the sewer pipe. In depositing rock into the trench, care
must be taken that the rock does not injure the structure.
      6.   All voids existing between the outside of the pipe and the limits of
a tunnel excavation or lining shall be filled with sand, free of silt,
thoroughly rammed or flushed into place, or with concrete composed of one part
portland cement, three (3) parts fine aggregate and five (5) parts coarse
aggregate thoroughly packed into place.
      7.   Sewers constructed in open cut across any existing or proposed
pavements, driveways and sidewalks (where locations are known), and all
trenches where the inner edge of the existing or proposed pavement, shall be
backfilled with gravel (grade 9), thoroughly flushed and jetted or tamped in
nine inch (9") lifts in place.
   H.   Completion Of Work: When the work is completed, all surplus material,
earth, rubbish, etc., shall be removed, and that portion of the surface of each
street disturbed by construction shall be left in as good condition as it was
before the commencement of the work, and it shall be promptly and regularly
maintained in such condition during a period of two (2) years after the final
acceptance of the work. This work of maintenance shall apply to the items of
materials and workmanship improperly installed in the first instance, and
maintenance measures made necessary by the ordinary wear and tear occasioned by
traffic shall not be at the expense of the contractor. (2016 Code)
14-7-5: INSPECTIONS AND TESTS:
It shall be the intention of this chapter to secure a sewer system with a
minimum amount of infiltration. Maximum allowable infiltration shall be one
hundred (100) gallons per inch of diameter of sewer per mile per twenty four
(24) hour day at any time for any section of the system. The joints shall be
tight, and visible leakage in the joints, or leakage in excess of that
specified above, shall be repaired at the contractor's expense by procedures
acceptable to the village engineer. (2016 Code)
14-7-6: SEWER SERVICES:
   A.   All labor, materials, equipment, services and tools required for the
furnishing and installation of sewer services required shall be furnished and
installed in compliance with the diameter and length as required by village
plumbing regulations, title 10, chapter 5 of this code.
   B.   Sewer services pipe shall consist of clay sewer pipe, thick walled PVC
or cast iron pipe.
   C.   Sewer services from main or lateral sewers toward the property line
shall be constructed as follows:
      1.   Services shall be laid in as straight a line as possible at a
uniform gradient, except a connection at the main or lateral sewers.
      2.   The minimum gradient allowable for sewer services shall be one-
fourth inch (1/4") per foot of length. Where the elevation of the main or
lateral sewer permits, within the minimum gradient allowance, the sewer service
shall be laid on a gradient such that its terminus shall not be less than three
feet (3') below the established grade of the street. A one- eighth (1/8) bend
pipe fitting shall be used for the first length adjacent to the main or lateral
sewer when connections are made to Y branches installed in such main or lateral
sewers.
      3.   Terminus of sewer service leads shall be shown on the contract
drawings. The ends shall be sealed with a vitrified clay or concrete round disc
or equal one inch (1") in thickness and of a diameter equal to the diameter of
the bell of the sewer service pipe to be sealed. The stoppers shall be set in
the ball end of the sewer service pipe and sealed in place with material of the
kind and quality used in pipe joints. Oakum shall be placed around the
periphery of the stopper before sealing in place to facilitate removal of the
stopper without breaking the bell of the pipe.
   D.   The contractor shall furnish and place a temporary stake opposite the
terminus of each sewer service. During construction of the curb and gutter, the
contractor shall mark the location of all sewer and water service lines with an
"S" or "W" etched into the curb and gutter as a permanent record of service
location. (2016 Code)

14-8-1: DRAINAGE SYSTEMS REQUIRED:
   A.   No subdivision, planned unit development or other development within
the corporate limits of the village shall be approved unless it is served by a
minor drainage system and a major drainage system.
   B.   The minor system shall be sized to handle the 10-year storm event and
shall consist of the storm sewer system and its appurtenances.
   C.   The major system shall consist of all the pathways that runoff takes
when the capacity of the minor system is exceeded and is composed of streets,
larger natural or manmade swales, detention and retention basins, creeks,
streams and rivers.
   D.   The major system shall be sized to handle the 100-year storm event
utilizing the "Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70 Rainfall DATA". The
lowest habitable floor of all structures (or the immediately adjacent ground if
a basement) shall be elevated at least one foot (1') above the calculated water
surface profile for the 100-year storm event.
   E.   All storm sewers which are installed in the public right of way or in
easements serving a central system shall be dedicated to the village. Every
subdivision or development shall have storm sewers separate and independent of
the sanitary sewer system and with an adequate outlet or connection with the
existing storm system. The outfall of said storm sewer systems shall be
designed to prevent the transportation of eroded solid and floating matter to
downstream points of discharge whether they be creeks, lakes or a municipal or
privately owned storm sewer system. (2016 Code)
14-8-2: DESIGN:

sewer.
   I.   Building drainage design shall be as follows:
      1.   A point of discharge of sump pumps shall be shown for each building
intended to have a basement or crawl space. Positive drainage from that point
shall be provided to the storm sewer system. Such drainage shall not be across
any street, sidewalk or parking lot and shall be to the rear of the property.
If feasible, fifteen (15) minutes' retention time shall be provided upstream of
the storm sewer system for said discharge.
      2.   Runoff shall be drained away from the building to lot line swales or
ditches, which shall merge as quickly as possible and then discharge into storm
sewers. The route of flow of stormwater away from each building into swales,
ditches and storm sewers, to where it leaves the site, shall be shown. Inlets
and catch basins shall be provided.
   J.   Positive drainage design shall be established for each lot whether or
not it is the intention to construct a building on that lot at that time.

   A.   When determining the location of improvements within a subdivision and
the location of buildings or structures on lots, the developer shall make every
reasonable effort to save healthy trees having a diameter of four inches (4")
or greater (measured at 6 inches above ground level).
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to require the developer
to develop his property at a lesser density or intensity than allowed by the
zoning ordinance or elsewhere in this title.
   C.   The developer shall submit a plan certifying the location, size and
species, using botanic and common names, of all healthy trees having a diameter
of four inches (4") or greater (measured at 6 inches above the ground level)
for areas within twenty five feet (25') of any proposed improvement. For
remaining areas covered by the preliminary plan, only the general locations of
the trees is required. The developer shall indicate on such plan which trees he
proposes to save in accordance with this chapter. The trees to be saved in
accordance with this chapter shall be agreed upon as part of the preliminary
plan approval.
   D.   In addition, the developer shall submit:
      1.   A proposed grading plan for the site indicating the location, size
and species, using botanic and common names, of the trees to be saved.
      2.   A plan establishing the methods to be used for preserving the trees
that are to be saved. Such plan shall include the following provisions:
         a.   All grading and construction equipment shall be forbidden from
encroaching within the tree's drip line;
         b.   Crushed limestone or other materials detrimental to the tree
shall not be dumped within the tree's drip line or at any higher location where
drainage toward the tree could affect the health of the tree; and
         c.   Installation of snow fencing at the periphery of the tree's drip
line shall be required.
      3.   The developer's proposed methodology for saving existing trees shall
be reviewed by the village engineer. If, in the opinion of the village
engineer, the developer has not taken the necessary precautions in preserving
such existing trees, the land development permit will not be issued until such
time as the developer satisfactorily amends his plans for the preservation of
such existing trees. If the developer and the village engineer cannot agree on
a satisfactory plan, the developer can appeal the decisions of the village
engineer to the village administrator.
   E.   In the event that a tree designated on the approved plan for saving and
such healthy tree shall be destroyed or razed by the developer during the
construction process, the developer shall replace such tree with a tree of a
species listed in subsection 14-11-3C of this chapter and having a diameter not
less than the tree so destroyed or razed (not to exceed 6 inches), measured at
six inches (6") above the ground level, in the approximate location of the tree
so destroyed or razed. (2016 Code)

same is detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare. (2016 Code)
14-11-6: LOT GRADING:
   A.   Grading of lots and roadways within the village shall be accomplished
in such manner as to prevent ponding in excess of eighteen inches (18") in the
event of complete failure of the storm sewer system. The only exceptions to
allowing the maximum of eighteen inches (18") are for stormwater detention
facilities in parking lots where up to one foot (1') of ponding is permitted
and for stormwater detention/retention basins where chapter 8 of this title is
applied.
   B.   Except in special cases, longitudinal grading on all grassed areas of
lots will be kept within the range of 0.50 percent to five percent (5%).
Driveway grades on all lots, as measured from the top of curb to finished
garage floor, shall be kept within the range of two percent (2%) to ten percent
(10%). Drainage easements will be provided along the rear and/or sides of where
surface waters from more than one lot are conveyed down a property line.
   C.   All lots with side slopes three horizontal to one vertical (3:1) or
greater shall be sodded, while side slopes steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical (2:1) shall be pegged and sodded.
   D.   Where the slope between adjacent properties is one foot (1') horizontal
to one foot (1') vertical, retaining walls or other treatments approved by the
village engineer shall be required.
   E.   Residential developers constructing five (5) or more buildings in a
subdivision shall fine grade each lot (front, side and rear yards) to the
grades on the approved grading plan. In preparation for either seed or sodding,
said fine grading shall be a condition to issuance of an occupancy permit. Lots
in industrial/commercial subdivisions shall be fine graded at the time each lot
is developed.
   F.   As a condition to the issuance of an individual occupancy permit, the
developer will furnish the village engineer with a certificate stating that the
finished grades on the lot substantially conform to the approved grading plan.
The developer shall guarantee that the individual lot itself, as well as the
lot in relation to adjoining lots, will drain properly for a period of one year
from the issuance of the occupancy permit or from the date of final grading
approval, whichever is later; provided, that no alterations are made to the
finished grading that adversely affect the drainage on the lot. If an
individual lot or a series of adjoining lots does not drain properly, the
homeowner or homeowners shall so notify the village engineer in writing prior
to the expiration of the one year guarantee. The village engineer will
investigate the complaint and, if justified, will notify the developer in
writing as to the improper grading/drainage. If the corrective work has not
been performed prior to the final subdivision inspection, the subdivision
security may be used to effectuate the work.
   G.   All residential lots shall be graded smooth and topped with at least
four inches (4") of black dirt after compacting and removal of stumps, trees
that cannot be saved, boulders and such. (2016 Code)
14-11-7: EROSION, SEDIMENTATION AND DUST CONTROL:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to guide, regulate and control
the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other
activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth on land situated in the village.
   B.   Definitions:
    BUILDING PERMIT: A permit issued by the village for the construction,
erection or alteration of a structure or building.
   CERTIFY OR CERTIFICATION: Formally attesting that the specific inspections
and tests, where required, have been performed and that such tests comply with
the applicable requirements of this chapter.
   CUBIC YARDS: The amount of material in excavation and/or fill measured by
the method of "average end areas".
   EXCAVATION: Any act by which organic matter, earth, sand, gravel, rock or
any other similar material is cut into, dug, quarried, uncovered, removed,
displaced, relocated or bulldozed and shall include the conditions resulting
therefrom.
   EXISTING GRADE: The vertical location of the existing ground surface prior
to excavation or filling.
   FILL: Any act by which earth, sand, gravel, rock or any other material is
deposited, placed, replaced, pushed, dumped, pulled, transported or moved by
man to a new location and shall include the conditions resulting therefrom.
   FINAL GRADE: The vertical location of the ground or pavement surface after
the grading work is completed in accordance with the site development plan.
   GRADING: Excavation or fill, or any combination thereof, and shall include
the conditions resulting from any excavation or fill.
   NATURAL DRAINAGE: Channels formed in the existing surface topography of the
earth prior to changes made by unnatural causes.
   PARCEL: All contiguous land in one ownership.
   PERMITTEE: Any person to whom a site development permit is issued.
   PERSON: Any individual, firm or corporation, public or private, the state of
Illinois and its agencies or political subdivisions, and the United States Of
America, its agencies and instrumentalities, and any agent, servant, officer or
employee of any of the foregoing.
   REMOVAL: Cutting vegetation to the ground, complete extraction of stumps, or
killing by spraying.
   SITE: A lot or parcel of land, or a contiguous combination thereof, where
grading work is performed as a single unified operation.

tree removal, clearing and storage or removal of topsoil.
   VACANT: Land on which there are no structures or only structures which are
secondary to the use or maintenance of the land itself.
   C.   Principles And Standards: Except as provided below, no plat of
subdivision or development shall be approved unless the preliminary plan and/or
accompanying materials indicate that measures to be taken to control erosion
and sedimentation will be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported
from the site by a storm event of 10-year frequency or less, and that the
following principles will be applicable to all development activities in the
area to be subdivided:
      1.   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the
site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible,
and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
      2.   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left
undisturbed wherever possible.
      3.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      4.   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff
waters from land undergoing development.
      5.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should
be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
      6.   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
      7.   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion and should be
protected against erosion and sedimentation during development.
      8.   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development.
   D.   Engineering Requirements:
      1.   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, an erosion
and sedimentation control plan showing the following must be submitted:
         a.   All erosion and sedimentation control measures necessary to meet
the objectives of this chapter throughout all phases of construction and
permanently after completion of development of the site.
         b.   Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed
preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer
application, and kind and quality of mulching for both temporary and permanent
vegetative control measures.
         c.   Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including
easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance.
         d.   Identification of the person(s) or entity which will have legal
responsibility for maintenance of erosion control structures and measures after
development is completed.
         e.   The proposed phasing of development of the site, including
stripping and clearing, rough grading and construction, and final grading and
landscaping. Phasing should identify the expected date on which clearing will
begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas and the sequence of
clearing, installation of temporary sediment control measures, installation of
storm drainage, paving streets and parking areas, and establishment of
permanent vegetative cover.
      2.   These submissions shall be prepared in accordance with the standards
and requirements contained in "Procedures And Standards For Soil Erosion And
Sedimentation Control In Northeastern Illinois", prepared by the northeastern
Illinois erosion and sedimentation control steering committee and adopted by
the county soil and water conservation district, which standards and
requirements are hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference.
      3.   The village engineer may waive specific requirements for the content
of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to
show that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of this
chapter. (2016 Code)
14-11-8: RESPONSIBILITY:
Failure of the village engineering department to observe or recognize hazardous
or unsightly conditions or to deny the site grading and excavation permit shall
not relieve the permittee from the responsibility for the conditions or damage
resulting therefrom. (2016 Code)
14-11-9: INSPECTIONS:
The village engineer shall make inspections as herein required and shall either
approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee
wherein the same fails to comply with the site grading and excavating plan.
Where it is found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated
or shown in the said plan, the village engineer may stop further work until
approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing
conditions. Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the
village engineer's department, shall be maintained at the site during progress
of the grading. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following
schedule, the permittee shall notify the village engineer's department at least
two (2) working days before the said inspection is to be made: first, when
rough grading has been completed; and second, when all work, including
installation of all drainage and other structures and required planting, has
been completed. (2016 Code)

improvements as outlined herein. However, the acceptance of the required
improvements is limited to the public improvement located in dedicated and
accepted public rights of way and accepted public improvements located within
easements granted to and accepted by the village. Acceptance of public
improvements shall be in accordance with the provisions hereof.
   B.   1. When all required improvements, public and private, are completed in
their entirety, the developer or owner must formally request the village, by
letter, to accept public improvements or approve private improvements.
      2.   Upon receipt of the letter of request, the village engineer shall
authorize and schedule a final inspection to take place as soon as reasonably
possible after receipt of the letter.
      3.   Final inspections shall not be scheduled between November 15 and
April 1. All deficient improvements which do not totally conform to this
chapter (either incomplete or poor workmanship of improvements) shall be
inventoried. The inventory of deficiencies shall be forwarded to the developer
or owner for processing.
      4.   When the deficiencies are corrected, the developer or owner shall
request a second inspection. Scheduling of the second inspection shall be the
same as for the first inspection.
      5.   If the length of time between the first and second inspections is
greater than four (4) months, or if the noted deficiencies are not correct at
the time the second inspection is made, the request for acceptance shall be
canceled.
      6.   If canceled, a second request letter shall be required. The second
request for acceptance is subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The developer or owner shall be required to pay all costs
incurred by the person conducting the inspection.
         b.   The punch list of deficiencies recorded during the previous
inspections shall be voided, and a complete reinspection is required.
      7.   After the inspections have been performed as above, the village
engineer shall direct a letter to the developer or owner stating such, and upon
receipt by the village engineer of the appropriate maintenance bonds and escrow
monies, the village engineer shall make his report to the village
administrator.
      8.   Public improvements shall be approved and accepted by resolution of
the village board, and private improvements shall be approved by resolution of
the village board only after receipt by the village administrator of the

chapter, approved plans and specifications, and applicable special use
ordinances, and that all required as builts have been received. (2016 Code)
14-12-4: PERMIT FEES, SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS SECURITY, ESCROW MONIES,
GUARANTEES AND LAND DEVELOPMENT PERMITS:
Before formal review and approval by the village engineer of any developments
to build within the village, the developer shall be responsible for the
following nonrefundable fees:
   A.   Permit Fees:
      1.   Land Developments: As part of the protective inspections policy of
the village, a land development permit fee as established in the annual fee
schedule is hereby required for all developments to cover engineering plans
review and construction inspections.
      2.   Miscellaneous Developments: Permit fees for the following are
established in the annual fee schedule: parking lots, curb cuts and street
openings.
      3.   Restriction On Building Permit Issuance: No building permits can be
issued for any phase of the development until such time as the village engineer
certifies to the director of the building department that the land development
permit and/or miscellaneous development permit has been issued.
   B.   Improvement Security:
      1.   A subdivider or developer, upon approval of the detailed engineering
plans by the village engineer, shall submit to the village engineer, for review
by the village attorney, and for deposit with the village clerk, a good and
sufficient security for the completion of all public and private common
improvements, less mass earth and parking lot improvements, in the amount of
the estimate of the village engineer of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
cost of the installation of such improvements. Said security shall provide that
monies in such estimated amounts are on deposit with a bank or other financial
institution and restricted for the purpose of the installation and completion
of said improvements.
      2.   Such security shall be evidenced by an appropriate instrument which
shall provide that no withdrawal or reduction shall be made without the written
consent of the village administrator and that in the event that said
improvements are not completed in accordance with village requirements, the
bank or other financial institution shall, upon written demand by the village
administrator, take any and all necessary steps to provide funds to the extent
of such bank's or financial institution's remaining liability on such security
for purpose of paying the cost of constructing said improvement. Such
instrument shall further provide that no more than fifty percent (50%) of the
amount deposited may be disbursed until the improvements have been completed
and accepted by the village engineer.
      3.   Approval of payments for the installation of improvements shall not
constitute acceptance of such improvements. All improvements, except the final
wearing surface of any road, to be constructed hereunder shall be completed
within two (2) years of the presentation of such guarantees or further building
permits or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued until such guarantees
or securities are updated to reflect cost escalations and completion dates.
      4.   Where such improvements are being installed by reason of an approval
of unit construction, the said security may be limited to those improvements
necessary for the unit being constructed. When the improvements have been
accepted for full ownership and maintenance by the village, all obligation for
the security set forth herein will be released by the village board; provided,
however, that the escrow monies referred to in subsection C of this section
must be submitted to the village engineer to be deposited with the village
clerk before such release. In the event that the subdivision improvements will
not ultimately be accepted by the village, the obligations hereunder will be
released when the project or phase is totally completed and an inspection is
made by the village to verify the completion of the required improvements in
accordance with the village standards and a release letter is authorized by the
village administrator.
      5.   The requirements for the improvements security set forth herein
apply to all types of developments regardless of use or ownership.
   C.   Escrow Monies: A subdivider or developer, before the public
improvements have been accepted by the village board, or before the private
improvements have been approved by the village board, shall deposit with the
village, in escrow, in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit, an amount equal
to five percent (5%) of the approved engineer's estimate as a guarantee against
any defect in the material or workmanship furnished in connection with such
improvement latent in character and not discernible at the time of the final
acceptance or approval of such improvement and to guarantee against any damage
to such improvements by reason of settling of the ground, base or foundation
thereof. Such deposit may be applied by the village for any amounts required by
the village to correct any such defects arising within any applicable guarantee
or warranty period. The balance of such deposit, if any, held at the end of
thirteen (13) months following final acceptance or approval of such
improvements shall be refunded or returned to the depositor or to the order of
the depositor.
   D.   Maintenance Bonds: A subdivider or developer, before the public
improvements have been accepted by the village board, or private common
improvements have been approved by the village board, shall provide to the
village a maintenance bond in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the approved
engineer's estimate for a period of two (2) years.
   E.   Expiration Of Securities, Etc.: Expiration of any securities, escrow
monies, guarantees, warranties, bonds or letters of credit, as defined in this
section shall not expire during the months of November, December, January,
February, March or April.

may result from strict compliance with these regulations, he may recommend
variations or exceptions (except where herein otherwise noted) to the
regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided, that such variation or exception shall not have the effect

variation is based are unique to the property for which the variation is sought
and are not applicable, generally, to other property; and

involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried

engineer may require such conditions as will, in good judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this title.

affect the intent and purpose of this title.

exceptions as may be recommended by the village engineer shall be forwarded to

exceptions. The village board may approve such variations or exceptions from
