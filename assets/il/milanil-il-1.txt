The purpose of this article is to provide for the fair and efficient

liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust,
available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any unpaid fine or

   A.   Any fine, other sanction, or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other

review law shall be a debt due and owing the village and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law. (Ord. 1487, 4-6-2009)
   B.   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of a
code violation, the village attorney may commence a proceeding in the county
circuit court for the purpose of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision
and order. Nothing in this article shall prevent the village from consolidating
multiple findings, decisions and orders against a person in such a proceeding.
Upon commencement of the action, the village shall file a certified copy of the
findings, decision and order, which shall be accompanied by a certification
that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision and order

by section 2-203 of the code of civil procedure or by certified mail, return
receipt requested; provided, that the total amount of fines, other sanctions,
and costs imposed by the findings, decision and order does not exceed seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). If the court is satisfied that the findings,
decision and order was entered in accordance with the requirements of state law
and the applicable village ordinance and that the violation had an opportunity
for a hearing and for judicial review: (Ord. 1487, 4-6-2009; amd. 2011 Code)
      1.   The court shall render judgment in favor of the village and against
the violator for the amount indicated in the findings, decision and order, plus
costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same
manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
      2.   The court may also issue any other orders and injunctions that are
requested by the village to enforce the order of the hearing officer to correct
a code violation.
   C.   In any case in which a hearing officer finds that a defendant has
failed to comply with a judgment ordering a defendant to correct a code
violation or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a code
violation, any expenses incurred by the village to enforce the judgment
including, but not limited to, attorney fees, court costs, and costs related to
property demolition or foreclosure after they are fixed by the hearing officer
shall be a debt due and owing the village and may be collected in accordance
with applicable law and this article.
   D.   A lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both,
of the defendant in the amount of any debt due and owing the village under this
article, and after court entry of judgment as set forth in subsection B of this
section. The lien may be recorded and enforced in the same manner as a judgment
lien pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No lien may
be enforced under this article until it has been recorded in the manner
provided by article XII of the code of civil procedure or by the uniform
commercial code.
   E.   A hearing officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set
a new hearing date upon a petition filed within twenty one (21) days after the
issuance of the order of default if the hearing officer determines that the
petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the village did not provide proper service
of process. (Ord. 1487, 4-6-2009)

employment shall be personally informed of the requirement for a drug test at

(i.e., testing of peace officers and testing of employees if required by
federal statutes).
      3.   Physicals:
         a.   The village will require a drug test as part of any regularly
scheduled physical for those who undergo such physicals. Employees shall
receive notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the physical is
scheduled and be informed that a drug test will be part of that physical.
         b.   Specific physicals, including a drug test, may be required for
those employees who have been exposed to toxic or other unhealthy substances
during the course of their work. These tests shall be limited to those specific
substances.
      4.   Probable Cause Situations: The village may require a drug test of
those employees suspected of using or being under the influence of a drug or
alcohol on the workplace where the department head/supervisor:
         a.   Has probable cause to believe that the employee's faculties are
impaired on village jobs; and
         b.   The employee is in a position where such impairment presents a
danger to the safety of the employee, another employee, a member of the public,

stringent than this policy.

         a.   The village shall provide employee assistance under the "Village
Of Milan Employees Assistant Program" (EAP) for drug and alcohol problems. The
village shall retain the right to evaluate employees in probable cause
situations and, in addition, shall take no disciplinary action against an
employee due to the employee's drug involvement the first time the employee's
drug test indicates the presence of alcohol/drugs, if the employee undergoes a
substance abuse evaluation and if the employee successfully completes a
substance abuse treatment as determined, if treatment is recommended by the
evaluation. However, if an employee fails to undergo the substance abuse
evaluation when required under the results of a positive drug test or fails to
successfully complete the substance abuse treatment when recommended by an
evaluation, the employee may be disciplined up to and including discharge. If
subsequent violations occur, the village may take disciplinary action as it
sees fit.
         b.   Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an employee from
seeking assistance on his/her own through the village employee assistance
program (EAP) prior to any detected violation.

testing requirement during the first interview.

1106, 3-18-1996)
         b.   Routine Physicals: Employees who have routine physicals as part
of the course and scope of their employment shall receive notice at least
thirty (30) days prior to the physical that their physical is scheduled, that a
drug test will be part of the physical, and that the records of the tests only
show or make use of information regarding chemical substances in the body which
are likely to affect the ability of the employee to perform his/her duties
safely while on his/her job. (Ord. 1106, 3-18-1996; amd. 2011 Code)
      12.   Confidentiality Of Test Results:

police officers when such prohibited activity occurs as a required part of such
officer's performance of his/her official duties.
      14.   Directives: The village establishes this policy in compliance and
confirmation with the following guidelines:
         a.   Executive order 12564: On September 15, 1986, former President
Reagan signed executive order 12564, mandating a drug free federal workplace.
The executive order calls for random drug testing in certain "sensitive"
government positions.

prospective employee must sign an acknowledgement in the following form:
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF DRUG POLICY PURSUANT TO DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE ACT OF 1988
The Village of Milan believes strongly in making the work environment of all
employees free of drugs and the accompanying abuses. Further, the Drug-Free
Workplace Act of 1988 mandates that federal contractors and grantees initiate
and maintain a drug- free workplace for their employees. Accordingly, all
employees are informed as follows:
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a
controlled substance, as defined by the federal law and regulation, is
prohibited in the Village's workplace or while performing any work for the
Village, and employees found to have engaged in any of the above activities
shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
Information on controlled substance and rehabilitation is available through the
Village Administrator and the Village of Milan Employee Assistance Program.
As a condition of remaining an employee of the Village, all employees must:
1. Abide by the terms of the policy;
2. Participate in drug-free awareness programs which are sponsored from time to
time by the Village;
3. Notify the Village Administrator of any criminal drug statute conviction for
a violation occurring in the workplace, no later than five (5) days after such
conviction.
The Village is required to notify the federal contracting agency of such
convictions.
I have received and read the Village's Drug-Free Workplace Policy set forth
above, understand its contents, and agree to abide by this Policy as a
condition of my continuing employment with the Village.

of the corporate authorities from a remote location via telephone, video or
internet connection; provided, that such attendance and participation is in
compliance with this policy and any other applicable laws.
   B.   Prerequisites: A member of the corporate authorities of the village
shall be provided the opportunity to attend an open and closed meeting or only
one of such meetings from a remote location if the member meets the following
conditions and a majority of a quorum of the corporate authorities votes to
approve the remote attendance:
      1.   The member must notify the recording secretary or village clerk at
least twenty four (24) hours before the meeting unless advance notice is
impractical;
      2.   The member must meet one of three (3) reasons described herein why
he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting, including either: a) that
the member cannot attend because of personal illness or disability; b) the
member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the business of the
village; or c) the member cannot attend because of a family or other emergency;
and
      3.   A quorum of the corporate authorities must be physically present.
   C.   Voting Procedures: After roll call, a vote of the corporate authorities
shall be taken, considering the prerequisites set forth in subsection B of this
section, on whether to allow an off site board member to participate remotely.
All of the members physically present are permitted to vote on whether remote
participation will be allowed. A vote may be taken to permit remote
participation for a stated series of meetings if the same reason applies in
each case. Otherwise, a vote must be taken to allow each remote participation.
   D.   Quorum And Vote Required: A quorum must be established by members
physically present at any meeting before it can be considered whether to allow
a member to participate in the meeting remotely. A vote of a majority of a
quorum shall be necessary to decide the issue. For the meeting to continue,
there shall always be a quorum physically present.
   E.   Minutes: The member participating remotely shall be considered an off
site participant and counted as present, by means of video or audio conference,
for that meeting if the member is allowed to participate. The meeting minutes
of the village shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member is
physically present, present by video, or present by audio means.
   F.   Rights Of Remote Member: The member permitted to participate remotely
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to. The remote
member shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any remote member shall be called during any vote
taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the secretary and placed in
the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member participating remotely may
leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member.
   G.   Closed Meetings: A quorum of the corporate authorities must be
physically present at any closed meeting. Members participating remotely shall
otherwise be entitled to participate in closed meetings by video or audio
conference.

reimbursed for the cost of the telephone call upon a valid receipt shown. Any
other costs associated with remote participation, including video conferencing
and other audio and video equipment, must be approved by the corporate
authorities.
   I.   Rights Of Disqualified Member: A member who is disqualified from remote
attendance because he or she does not meet the prerequisites set forth under
subsection B of this section may nevertheless listen to the meeting via audio
or video conference. Such a disqualified member would not have a right to vote,
but would have only those rights which a member of the general public in
attendance at such meeting would have. (Ord. 1401, 10-16-2006)
1-9-2: CLOSED SESSION RECORDING POLICY:

meeting of the corporate authorities in June and December, the agenda shall
include the following item: "Review of the minutes of all closed sessions that
have not yet been released for public review and determination of which, if
any, may then be released". Minutes or recordings shall not be released unless
the corporate authorities of the village find that it is no longer necessary to
keep them confidential to protect the public interest or to protect the privacy
of an individual. As to any minutes or recordings, or portions thereof, not
released, the corporate authorities of the village shall find that the "need
for confidentiality still exits" as to those minutes or recordings, or portions
thereof. The corporate authorities may require the village attorney's opinion
regarding the release or nonrelease of the respective recordings and minutes.

This investment policy applies to the investment activities of all funds of the
village, except for the police pension fund which is subject to the written
order of the board of trustees of the police pension fund. In the absence of
such orders, monies received and/or securities held by the village on behalf of
these funds shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of this
policy. The village policies for cash management are based upon the realization
that there is a time value to money. Cash management procedures shall include
the following:
   A.   Receipts: All monies due the village shall be collected as promptly as
possible. Monies that are received shall be deposited in an approved financial
institution no later than the next business day after receipt by the village to
comply with the public funds deposit act 1 , which mandates prompt investment
of funds.
   B.   Disbursements: Any disbursement to suppliers of goods and/or services
or to employees for salaries and wages shall be contingent upon available
budgeted funds. Disbursements shall be made in accordance with the village
purchasing policy.
   C.   Cash Forecast: At least annually, a cash forecast shall be prepared
using expected revenue sources and items of expenditure to project cash
requirements over the fiscal year of the village. The forecast shall be updated
from time to time to identify the probable investable balances that will be
available. (Ord. 1166, 3-15-1999)
 
Notes
1 1. 30 ILCS 225/0.01.
3-1-2: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of the investment policy of the village is to establish cash
management and investment guidelines for village officials responsible for the
stewardship of public funds. The primary objectives, in priority order, of
investment activities shall be safety, liquidity, and yield:
   A.   Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment
program of the village. Except for the pension funds, for which short term
market fluctuation is tolerable, each investment transaction shall seek to
first ensure that capital losses are avoided, whether they be from securities
default or erosion of market value. Market speculation is not appropriate in
the investment of funds. Normally a "buy and hold" approach to investment will
be used. Investments are intended to be purchased so they will mature when
funds are needed. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest
rate risk.
      1.   Credit Risk: The village will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss
due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by:
         a.   Limiting investments to the safest types of securities.
         b.   Prequalifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers,
intermediaries, and advisors with which the village will do business.
         c.   Diversifying the investment portfolio so that potential losses on
individual securities will be minimized.
      2.   Interest Rate Risk: The village will minimize the risk that the
market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general
interest rates by:
         a.   Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to
meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to
sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.
         b.   Investing operating funds primarily in shorter term securities,
money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools.
   B.   Liquidity: The village investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the village to meet all operating requirements that may be
reasonably anticipated in any village fund. This is accomplished by structuring
the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet
anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all possible cash
demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of
securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). A
portion of the portfolio also may be placed in local government investment
pools which offer same day liquidity for short term funds.
   C.   Yield: The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of
attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles,
taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return
of investments is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity
objectives described in this section. The core of investments are limited to
relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return
relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall not be sold prior to
maturity, with the following exceptions:
      1.   A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss
of principal.
      2.   A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration
in the portfolio.
      3.   Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
(Ord. 1166, 3-15-1999)
3-1-3: STANDARDS OF CARE:
   A.   Prudence:
      1.   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be
the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing
an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion, and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in
accordance with the terms of this policy.
      2.   Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   B.   Ethics And Conflicts Of Interest:
      1.   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall
refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper
execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their
ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall
disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they
conduct business.
      2.   They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment
positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio.
Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment
transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf
of the village.
   C.   Delegation Of Authority:
      1.   Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the
treasurer pursuant to the provisions of title 1, chapter 6, article B of this
code. Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby
delegated to the treasurer, who shall act in accordance with established
written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment
program consistent with this investment policy. Procedures should include
references to: safekeeping, delivery versus payment, investment accounting,
repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, and collateral/depository
agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as
provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the
treasurer. The treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken
and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of
subordinate officials. The internal controls shall be reviewed by an
independent certified public accountant in conjunction with the annual
examination of the financial statements of the village. The controls shall be
designed to prevent losses of public funds arising from fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets,
or impudent actions by employees and officers of the village.
      2.   One of the required elements of the system of internal controls
shall be the timely reconciliation of all village bank accounts. Bank
reconciliations shall be performed on a monthly basis and shall be completed no
later than thirty (30) days after the end of the monthly cycle. (Ord. 1166, 3-
15-1999)
3-1-4: SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY:
   A.   The village will not maintain funds in any financial institution that
is not a member of the FDIC or SAIF system. Furthermore, the village will not
maintain funds in any financial institution not willing or capable of posting
required collateral for funds in excess of the FDIC or SAIF insurable limits.
   B.   The village will not select as depository a financial institution in
which the village funds on deposit will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
institution's capital stock and surplus. Priority for investing local funds may
be given to banking institutions which exhibit compliance with the community
reinvestment act such as:
      1.   Assist the village in achieving neighborhood redevelopment
objectives.
      2.   Actively market lending programs in older, lower income
neighborhoods.
      3.   Develop programs which better meet credit needs of specified
neighborhoods.
      4.   Assist the village in developing programs which promote reinvestment
and revitalization of specified neighborhoods (e.g., risk lending pool). (Ord.
1166, 3-15-1999)
3-1-5: SUITABLE AND AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS:
   A.   Types Of Investments:
      1.   The village may invest in any type of security allowed by law as set
out in the public funds investment act of the state of Illinois (the

other securities, which are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the
United States Of America.

loan associations incorporated under laws of the state of Illinois or any other
state or under laws of the United States and only in those savings and loan
associations insured by SAIF.
         d.   Short term obligations of corporations (commercial paper)
organized in the United States with assets exceeding five hundred thousand
dollars ($500,000.00) if:
            (1)   Such obligations are rated at the time of purchase at the
highest classification established by at least two (2) standard rating services
and which mature not later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of
purchase; and
            (2)   No more than ten percent (10%) of village funds are invested
in such obligations at any time; and
            (3)   Such purchases do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
corporation's outstanding obligations.
         e.   Short term discount obligations of federal agencies.
         f.   Illinois public treasurer's investment pool or other similar
investments that are made within the parameters set by the Illinois investment
of public funds act.
      2.   Investment in derivatives of the above instruments is prohibited.
   B.   Collateralization:
      1.   It is the policy of the village to require that funds on deposit
with banks and savings and loans in excess of FDIC or SAIF insurance limits be
secured by some form of collateral. The village will accept any of the
following assets as collateral:
         a.   U.S. government securities.
         b.   Obligations of agencies of the United States of America,
including: (i) the federal land banks, federal intermediate credit banks, banks
for cooperative, federal farm credit banks, or any other entity authorized to
issue debt obligations under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (12 U.S.C. 2001 et
seq.) and Acts amendatory thereto; (ii) the federal home loan banks and the
federal home loan mortgage corporation; and (iii) any other agency created by
Act of Congress, as defined and permitted by paragraph (c) of Section 2
‘’Authorized Investments” of the Illinois Public Funds Investment Act. 30 ILCS
235(c)(2).
         c.   Obligations of federal instrumentalities.
         d.   Obligations of the state of Illinois.
         e.   Obligations of the village.
      2.   The amount of collateral provided will be not less than one hundred
five percent (105%) of the fair market value of the net amount of public funds
secured. The ratio of fair market value of collateral to the amount of funds
secured will be reviewed quarterly, and additional collateral will be held by
the village or in safekeeping and evidenced by a safekeeping agreement. If
collateral is held in safekeeping, it may be held by a third party or by an
escrow agent of the pledging institution. Collateral agreements will preclude
the release of the pledged assets without an authorized signature from the
village. Substitution or exchange of securities held in safekeeping cannot be
done without prior approval of the village.

3-1-6: INVESTMENT PARTNERS:
   A.   Diversification:
      1.   In order to reduce the risk of default, the investment portfolio of
the village shall not exceed the following diversification limits: No financial
institution shall hold more than twenty percent (20%) of the village investment

securities maturing more than five (5) years from the date of purchase or in
accordance with state and local statutes and ordinances.
   C.   Investment In Readily Available Funds: Because of inherent difficulties
in accurately forecasting cash flow requirements, a portion of the portfolio
should be continuously invested in readily available funds such as LGIPs, money

      3.   Tax collector's gross receipts during those months upon the basis of
which the tax is imposed;

      5.   Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
On or before the last day of every month thereafter, each tax collector shall
make a like return to the village treasurer for a corresponding one month
period. The tax collector making the return herein provided for shall, at the
time of making such return, pay to the village treasurer, the amount of tax
herein imposed; provided that in connection with any return the tax collector
may, if he so elects, report and pay an amount based upon his total billings of
business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later
payments based upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross
receipts.

on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials
used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is
extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross
charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel
termination point within this municipality and charges for the portion of the
interoffice channels provided within this municipality. Charges for that
portion of the interoffice channel connecting two (2) or more channel
termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional
boundary of this municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by
multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the interoffice channel by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points
that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality and the
denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points
connected by the interoffice channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include
any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this article, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the
internal revenue code, 4) 911 surcharges, or 5) charges added to customers'
bills pursuant to the provisions of section 9-221 or 9-222 of the public
utilities act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by
retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois commerce
commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other
amounts specified in those provisions of the public utilities act;

municipality;

222.1 of the public utilities act to the extent of such exemption and during
the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic
opportunity;
   F.   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided
in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that
the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or
between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service;
   G.   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices;
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act; or
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services of telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or
terminate outside this state.
INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.
PERSON: Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association,

of this state.
PURCHASE AT RETAIL: The acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications
through a sale at retail.
RETAILER: Every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as
defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon
application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer
not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect
the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the
department at its discretion.
RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Terms):
Means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or

corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or
permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving

private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,

specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 1549, 12-19-2011)
3-3F-2: TAX IMPOSED:
Effective for all bills issued on or after July 1, 2012, a tax is hereby
imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event,
shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by
this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in
the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation
of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or
municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any
tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the
amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax
properly due and paid in another municipality in this state which was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this
state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 1549, 12-19-2011)
3-3F-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 1549, 12-19-2011)
3-3F-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before August 31, 2012, and on or before the last day of every month
thereafter, the tax imposed under this article on telecommunication retailers
shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required by the
department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal telecommunications tax
act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any accompanying rules and
regulations created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 1549, 12-19-
2011)
3-3F-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 1549, 12-19-2011)

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior

interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 1225, 12-18-2000;

The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;

   A.   The village board of trustees hereby finds that abandoned and
inoperable motor vehicles, as defined in Section 5-88-3 of this article and
Section 11-40-3 of the Illinois Municipal Code: 1) constitute a safety hazard
and a public nuisance; 2) are detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of
the general public by presenting obstacles to traffic and by harboring disease,
providing breeding places for vermin, creating fire hazards, and presenting
physical dangers to children and others; 3) produce scenic blights which
degrade the environment and adversely affect land values and the proper
maintenance and continuing development of the village; 4) present a resource
out of place and an energy loss to the village economy; and 5) require
governmental attention in order to assure the expeditious removal and recycling
of the derelict vehicles.
   B.   The village board of trustees declares, therefore, that it is the
policy of the village: 1) to prohibit the retention of abandoned and inoperable
motor vehicles and to enforce such prohibition by law while reminding vehicle
owners of their own individual responsibility to dispose of such vehicles; and
2) encourage the development of procedures and techniques to facilitate the
expeditious removal of derelict motor vehicles from private premises. (Ord.

decision to the registered owner or the lawful owner or occupant of the
premises where the vehicle is located with the recommendation that said copy be
placed inside the vehicle in a location that is plainly visible from the

may nevertheless grant such review. (1983 Code §
3-4-10)

rise to the violation. If the agreed course of action does not result in the
abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is
reached within thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request
authorization for the village attorney to commence a legal proceeding to abate
the nuisance.
   H.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the chief
of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any other documentation
which supports legal proceedings, to the village attorney.
   I.   When a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as
required in this section, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance
activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or ordered for any
other purpose. (Ord. 1136, 8-18-1997)
6-5F-6: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION; BURDEN OF PROOF:
   A.   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the
village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the
evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 1136, 8-18-
1997)
   B.   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 1136, 8-18-1997; amd. 2011
Code)
   C.   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors if they need be found appropriate and
shall cite those found applicable:
      1.   The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to
mitigate or correct the problem at the property.
      2.   Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous.
      3.   The magnitude or gravity of the problem.
      4.   The cooperation of the person in charge with the village.
      5.   The cost to the village of investigating and correcting or
attempting to correct the condition. (Ord. 1136, 8-18-1997)
6-5F-7: EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES:
   A.   In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for
such interim relief as is deemed by the chief of police to be appropriate. In
such an event, there need not be compliance with the notification provision set
forth in section
6-5F-5 of this article; however, the village shall make a diligent effort to
notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   B.   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property", as defined in section
6-5F-1 of this article, the court may order the remedy set out herein. In
addition, in the event that the court also finds the person in charge had
knowledge of activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating
this article and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a
civil fine as provided herein.
   C.   The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure
the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to effect a closure
shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property. If used, the word
"costs" means those costs actually incurred by the village for the physical
securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs.
   D.   The village, in performance of the closure, shall prepare a statement
of cost, and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court
for its review. If no objection to the statement is made within the period
described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against the
property.
   E.   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.
   F.   A tenant is entitled to his/her reasonable relocation costs, as those
are determined by the court, if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into
the property after either:
      1.   The owner received notice as described herein of the police chief's
determination as described above; or
      2.   An unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this section.
   G.   Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil penalty
by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.
(Ord. 1136, 8-18-1997)
6-5F-8: OTHER REMEDIES:
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the village from taking any action under
any other applicable section of this code or any other ordinance or code for
any violation thereof or limit the authority of the village to seek injunctive
relief or any other appropriate legal remedy for any violation of any such
other section of this code or any other ordinance or code. (Ord. 1760, 5-16-
2022)
6-5F-9: SEVERABILITY:
Should any part of this chapter be determined to be illegal, invalid, or
otherwise unenforceable, then all such remaining parts not so affected by such
illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability shall continue in full force and
effect. (Ord. 1760, 5-16-2022)

this section. If the plaintiff is a governmental unit, reasonable attorney fees
may be awarded up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00). (Ord. 1120, 10-21-

or service of any alcoholic beverage is prohibited because of age to consume or
to possess in any manner, including by consumption, any such alcoholic
beverage, except as otherwise provided by law. This violation may be proven by
evidence which indicates that the breath of the person charged with such
offense had a smell associated, generally or specifically, with any alcoholic
beverage and no additional evidence relating thereto shall be necessary to find
the defendant to be in violation of this section. It shall not be necessary to
show that the person charged with an offense hereunder was at the time in
question under the influence of any alcoholic beverage in any manner, but such
evidence shall be admissible to prove a violation of this section.
   B.   An affirmative defense to a charge of violation of this section may be
raised to show that the minor has consumed an alcoholic beverage while
participating in a recognized religious ceremony, or in the privacy of a home
under the direct supervision of the parents or parent or legal guardian, or at
a location where consumption by said minor is not otherwise prohibited by law.

attempt to notify the owner, lessee, or person identifying himself or herself
as the owner or lessee of the vehicle, or any person who is found to be in
control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense, of the fact of the
seizure, and of the vehicle owner's or lessee's right to an administrative

the rules adopted pursuant thereto, are adopted and shall apply to and govern
every action for the judicial review of the final findings, decision and order
of the hearing officer under this article.
   B.   Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the
failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the administrative review
law shall be a debt due and owing the village and, as such, may be collected in
accordance with applicable law.
   C.   After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the
administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code
violation, the village may commence a proceeding in the circuit court of the
county for purposes of obtaining a judgment of the findings, decision and
order. Nothing in this section shall prevent the village from consolidating
multiple findings, decisions and orders against a person in such a proceeding.

that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings, decision and order was
issued in accordance with this article and the applicable village ordinance.

   A.   The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the
village as the result of finding of a code violation under this article shall
attach to the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a
finding of a code violation against one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or
transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner
of property takes subject to the findings, decision and order of a hearing
officer under this article.
   B.   The owner of a building located in the village who, directly or
indirectly, has collected, or caused to be collected, rentals from an occupant

in whose behalf vendor payment of the rental was made by the Illinois
department of public aid, the department of human services (acting as successor
to the department of public aid under the department of human services act), or
the village, as the case may be. The liability as herein provided is to the
Illinois department of public aid, the department of human services (acting as
successor to the department of public aid under the department of human
services act), or the village making the vendor payment of the rental.

the owner of record of a building has been notified in writing that such owner
is in violation of any such village ordinance. Such notice shall be personally
served upon such owner of record or sent by registered mail to the last known
address of such owner.
   D.   A person who contracts with the federal government or any of its
agencies, including, without limitation, the department of housing and urban
development, to care for vacant residential real estate shall be responsible
for maintaining the property to prevent and correct village health and safety
code violations.
   E.   A person who intentionally violates this section is guilty of an
offense and shall be fined not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00).
   F.   For purposes of this section, the following words and terms shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection:

             housekeeping unit for living, sleeping, cooking and eating. The
FAMILY UNIT: fact that any such family unit is used or intended to be used with

required to put in such curb a stopcock or make such other changes as are
necessary to conform to these requirements when so instructed by the water
department.

10-13-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit And Compliance Required: No person, firm, corporation, or
governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the
floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the building
inspector. The building inspector shall not issue a development permit if the
proposed development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Application For Permit: The application for development permit shall be
accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings;
      4.   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section
10-13-7 of this chapter; and
      5.   Cost of project or improvements as estimated by a licensed engineer
or architect. A signed estimate by a contractor may also meet this requirement.
   C.   Review Of Application: Upon receipt of an application for a development
permit, the building inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the
base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map is
not in the floodplain and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this
chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base
flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but not shown on the current flood
insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
   D.   Records Of Ground Elevation: The building inspector shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and
certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
   E.   Additional Required Permits: The building inspector shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal,
state, and local permits, approvals or permit not required letters that may be
required for this type of activity. The building inspector shall not issue a
permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.

10-13-7 of this chapter the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of section

or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 1507, 3-15-2010)
10-13-11: VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority: Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship
on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the planning
commission for a variance. The planning commission shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the village
board. The village may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as
it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   B.   Standards For Variance Request: No variance shall be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or the
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   C.   Effects And Risks Of Approved Variances: The planning commission shall
notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of the
building protections standards of section
10-13-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   D.   Historic Landmarks: Variances to the building protection requirements
of section
10-13-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure, as defined in
section
10-13-2 of this chapter as "historic structures", may be granted using criteria
more permissive than the requirements of sections
10-13-6 and
10-13-7 of this chapter, subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 1507, 3-15-2010)
10-13-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully hereunder. (Ord. 1507, 3-15-2010)
10-13-13: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the corporate
authorities of the village to fulfill the requirements of the national flood
insurance program including the ordinance adopted November 3, 1986. However,
this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to
achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or
impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this
chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict
or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 1507, 3-15-2010)
10-13-14: VIOLATION; PENALTIES:
   A.   Determination Of Violation; Notice: Failure to obtain a permit for
development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a
permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Upon
due investigation, the building inspector may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The building inspector shall notify
the owner in writing of such violation.
   B.   Penalties: If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct
the violation:
      1.   The village shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   C.   Notice Of Insurance And Development Suspension; Hearing:
      1.   The building inspector shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and, therefore,
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      2.   The building inspector is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      3.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         a.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         b.   The time and place of the hearing.
      4.   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning
board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or
revoked.
   D.   Other Actions: Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.

notice as the zoning board of appeals, by rule, may require.
   C.   Standards For Variance: The zoning board of appeals shall not vary the
regulations of this title, as authorized in this section, unless there is
evidence presented thereto in each specific case that:
      1.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
      2.   The conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      3.   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property;
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this title and has
not been created by any persons presently having an interest in the property;
      5.   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      6.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
      7.   The purpose of the variance shall not be to establish a use
otherwise excluded from the particular district in which it is requested; and
      8.   The zoning board of appeals may impose such conditions and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards established in this section.
   D.   Authorized Variances: Variances from the regulations of this title
shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals only in accordance with the
standards established in this section and may be granted only in the following
instances and in no others:
      1.   To permit any yard or setback of less dimension than required by the
applicable regulations;
      2.   To permit any building or structure to exceed the height limitations
imposed by the applicable regulations;
      3.   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no
event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be less than
eighty percent (80%) of the required area and width;
      4.   To permit the same off street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses; provided, that substantial use of
such facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week;
      5.   To reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character or use of a building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely being granted for a convenience;
      6.   To permit the alteration or enlargement of an existing building or
use located on premises in a district which prohibits that use of land or
building, or the height and area of buildings existing at the effective date
hereof where such alteration or enlargement is a necessary incident to the use
of the structure existing at the effective date hereof, or amendment or change
hereto;
      7.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent
of more than fifty percent (50%) of its actual cash value, as determined by the
official county tax assessment and equalization rate, where the zoning board of
appeals finds some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use, and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use
is not to continue a monopoly; and
      8.   To permit other variances as authorized in the floodplain ordinance
of the village.
   E.   Grant Of Variance: The concurring vote of four (4) members of the
zoning board of appeals shall be necessary to grant a variance. No decision of
the zoning board of appeals granting a variance shall be valid for a period
longer than twelve (12) months from the date of such order unless the building
permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a
building is started or the use is commenced within such period.
   F.   Effect Of Denial Of Variance: No application for a variance that has
been denied wholly or in part by the zoning board of appeals shall be
resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of said order of denial,
except on the grounds of new evidence found to be valid by the zoning board of
appeals. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

   A.   Purpose And Authority: For the purpose of promoting the public health,
safety, morals, comfort, and general welfare, conserving the value of property
throughout the village, and lessening or avoiding congestion in the public
streets and highways, the president and village board may, from time to time in
the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the regulations imposed in the
districts created by this title. This title may be amended; provided, that in
all amendments adopted under the authority of this section, due allowance shall
be made for existing conditions, the conservation of property values, the
direction of building development to the best advantage of the entire
community, and the uses to which the property is devoted at the time of the
adoption of such amendment.
   B.   Procedure:
      1.   Hearing Required; Notice: A public hearing shall be held by the
Planning Commission before adoption of any amendment, supplement, or change by
the Village Board. Public notice of such public hearing shall be placed in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Village not more than thirty (30)
days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
      2.   Application Fee And Publication Charges: In order to partially
defray the expenses of a zoning change public hearing, each person petitioning
for a zoning change shall deposit with the Village Clerk the sum of seventy
five dollars ($75.00) and shall, in addition to such fee, be liable to
reimburse the Village for the actual cost of the publication of the legal
notice of the public hearing on such application in a newspaper. No part of
such application fee or publication charges shall be refunded to applicant for
failure of said amendment to be enacted into law. (Ord. 1675, 4-16-2018)
      3.   Protests: In case of a written protest against any proposed
amendment of the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by the
owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by
the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately joining or
across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the
frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, such protest
being filed with the Village Clerk, the amendment shall not be passed except by
a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all members of the Village Board.
   C.   Findings Of Fact; Recommendations Of Planning Commission:
      1.   Within forty five (45) days after the close of the hearing on a
proposed amendment, the Planning Commission shall make written findings of fact
and shall submit same, together with its recommendations, to the Village Board.
Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change the zoning
classification of particular property, the findings of fact and recommendations
shall include the following information:
         a.   Existing use of property within the general area of the property
in question;
         b.   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question;
         c.   The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted
under the existing zoning classifications;
         d.   The trend in development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which have taken place since
the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification; and

classification as the proposed zoning amendment. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
      2.   The Planning Commission shall not recommend the adoption of a
proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such amendment is in
the public interest as well as that of the applicant. The Planning Commission
may recommend the adoption of an amendment changing the zoning classification
of the property in question to any higher classification than requested by the
applicant. For the purpose of this subsection C2, the AG-1 Agricultural
Preservation District shall be considered the highest classification and the I-
3 Heavy Industrial District shall be considered the lowest classification.
(Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. 2011 Code)

submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission or, if disapproved, shall
receive a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the entire Village Board. (Ord.
1301, 3-15-2004)
   E.   Publication Of Zoning Map: The Village Board shall cause to be
published, no later than March 31 of each year, a map clearly showing the
existing zoning divisions and classifications. If, in any calendar year, there
are no changes in zoning divisions and classifications, no map shall be
published for such calendar year. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. 2011 Code)
   F.   Refiling Of Denied Request: Upon denial by the Village Board of an
application to change the zoning of a particular property, a second zoning
request which is not substantially or materially different from the denied
request shall not be accepted from the same or a different person for a public
hearing to be held within one year from the date of the denial by the Village
Board. The Village Administrator shall determine whether a request is
substantially or materially different and submittable, although the village
board may, by majority vote, reverse a decision of the village administrator to
not accept a zoning request for public hearing. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

11-3A-4: Hearing
11-3A-5: Findings And Recommendations
11-3A-6: Standards
11-3A-7: Conditions And Guarantees
11-3A-1: PURPOSE; USE CATEGORIES:
The development and administration of this title is based upon the division of
the village into zoning districts, within which districts the use of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to
the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular locations. Such special uses fall
into two (2) categories: (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. Ord. 1523, 9-7-2010)
   A.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest; and
   B.   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-3A-2: INITIATION OF SPECIAL USE CONSIDERATION:
Any person having a freehold interest in land, a possessory interest entitled
to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest which may become a freehold
interest, any of which is specifically enforceable, may file an application to
use such land for one or more of the special uses provided in this title in the
zoning district in which the land is located. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. Ord.
1523, 9-7-2010)
11-3A-3: APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USE:
An application for a special use shall be filed with the zoning officer on a
form as the zoning officer shall prescribe. The application shall be
accompanied by such plans and/or data prescribed by the planning commission and
shall include a statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence
showing that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth
in section
11-3A-6 of this article. Such application shall be forwarded from the zoning
officer to the secretary of the planning commission with a request for a public
hearing and report relative thereto. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. Ord. 1523, 9-
7-2010)
11-3A-4: HEARING:
   A.   Upon receipt in proper form of the application and statement referred
to in section
11-3A-3 this article, the planning commission shall hold at least one public
hearing on the proposed special use. Notice of the time and place of such
hearing shall be published not less than fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30)
days preceding said hearing at least once in a newspaper of general circulation
in the village. Supplemental or additional notices may be published or
distributed as the planning commission may, by rule, prescribe from time to
time. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. Ord. 1523, 9-7-2010)
   B.   The planning commission shall hold at least one hearing on the
application and may hold as many hearings as necessary when the nature of the
application and the nature of any proposed evidence may require additional
hearings. All hearings shall be conducted to assure fundamental fairness and a
full opportunity by the applicant, objectors, and a reasonable number of other
interested citizens to participate fully in the hearing process, including, but
not limited to, the right to present witnesses on the applicable standards in
section
11-3A-6 of this article and the opportunity to question any witness of the
other party. The chairperson shall have the right to restrict repetitive
testimony.
   C.   Any party appearing before the planning commission may exercise the
right to transcribe or record the proceedings at the expense of the party. The
planning commission shall accommodate any request to transcribe or record the
proceedings.
   D.   The planning commission reserves the right to control the location of
recording devices to ensure the orderly nature of the proceedings. The party
exercising their right to transcribe or record the proceedings shall have
recording equipment and/or person(s) who will transcribe the proceedings
available at the commencement of the hearing. The failure of said party to
provide recording equipment and/or person(s) to transcribe said hearing shall
not be just cause to request continuance. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-3A-5: FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
For each application for a special use, the zoning officer shall prepare and
relay to the planning commission findings and recommendations, including the
recommended stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that are
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-
2004; amd. Ord. 1523, 9-7-2010)
11-3A-6: STANDARDS:
Upon making an application for a special use permit, the applicant shall be
responsible for presenting evidence at a public hearing sufficient to justify
the planning commission in finding that the following standards have been met:
   A.   That the proposed special use will not conflict with the stated purpose
contained within the general description for each zoning classification, and
will not prevent the orderly development and improvement of the surrounding
property in accordance with the village comprehensive plan.
   B.   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the proposed
special use will not materially increase any risk to public health and safety,
including, but not necessarily limited to, risk of fire or other operational
accident, beyond that level of risk which ordinarily accompanies the permitted
uses within the subject zoning classification.
   C.   That the proposed special use will not overly burden the village public
utilities systems and infrastructure. In determining whether this standard has
been met, the determination should be based upon whether the increased burden
would unduly impact the reserve capacity of the public utilities or
infrastructure.
   D.   That the proposed special use will not unreasonably interfere with the
use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose
or purposes of the existing permitted uses. In considering whether any
interference in use and enjoyment of neighboring property is reasonable, the
proposed special use should be compared with uses permitted within the same
zoning classification and that interference which can reasonably be anticipated
to accompany those permitted uses shall be deemed to be reasonable with a
special use. (Ord. 1523, 9-7-2010)
11-3A-7: CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES:
Prior to the granting of any special use, the planning commission shall
stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance, and operation of the special use as is deemed
necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance
with the standards specified in section
11-3A-6 of this article. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the
planning commission shall require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that there is and will be compliance with the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. Ord. 1523, 9-7-
2010; 2011 Code)

natural features and the rural landscape, while allowing low density
residential development that minimizes its impact on agricultural land, farming
operations and sensitive environmental features. The preferred use in the AG-
1 district is agriculture. The district is intended to permit a range of uses
related to agriculture, to encourage preservation of large blocks of farmland
and to permanently protect from development the tracts of land which remain

11-7B-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The AG-2 general agricultural district is established to protect and
maintain the agricultural economy and the open space and natural features of
rural areas of the village in order to protect lands for continued farming,
allow nonfarm residential development on a limited basis, and minimize
conflicts between agricultural and nonagricultural areas. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-
2004; amd. 2011 Code)
   B.   The AG-2 district is also established to protect those agricultural
lands which, due to their location, soils, and use for agricultural activities,
warrant protection from indiscriminate development. However, their proximity to
existing development, combined with pressures for new development, makes these
lands unsuitable for preservation according to the more restrictive regulations
of the AG-1 agricultural preservation district. The AG-2 district is also
intended to protect those agricultural lands that would otherwise be subject to
residential subdivision activity which could render these important farmlands
useless for farming. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

11-16-3: Specific Content
11-16-4: Standards
11-16-5: Conditions And Guarantees
11-16-1: PURPOSES AND PRINCIPALS:
   A.   The purpose of the planned unit development (PUD) district is to
promote to the extent possible:
      1.   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the public
by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other chapters of this title.
      2.   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
      3.   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation,
topographic, and geologic features.
      4.   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better development, design and the construction of
aesthetic amenities.
      5.   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, and other facilities.
      6.   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals, and welfare.
      7.   To improve stormwater management practices and reduce flooding,
erosion, and sedimentation through the retention of open space, vegetation, and
natural drainage patterns.
      8.   To implement adopted land use and community policies.
      9.   To implement provisions of the Illinois quad cities greenway plan.
      10.   To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land,
with amenities in the form of neighborhood open space, and with a strong
neighborhood identity.
      11.   To conserve scenic views and elements of the village's rural
character.
   B.   The PUD district is intended to provide for a development incorporating
a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and developed as a
unit, but departs from the normal standards and requirements of other chapters
of this title.
   C.   The planned unit development may provide amenities not otherwise
required by law and may establish facilities and open space greater than the
minimums required by law. Such development may consist of conventionally
subdivided lots or provide for development by a land use and zoning plan which
establishes the location and extent of the features of the planned unit
development in keeping with the purpose of the plan.
   D.   The purposes and principals of this section shall not be interpreted to
permit the reduction of standards set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-
2004)
11-16-2: PROCEDURES:
The owner, owners, or bona fide buyer of any tract of land may petition the
planning commission for a change to the PUD zoning district in accordance with
chapter 3, article A of this title. A planned unit development shall be
authorized in accordance with the following procedures:
   A.   Application For Planned Unit Development:
      1.   The application for a rezoning to the PUD zoning district shall be
accompanied by an application plan meeting the requirements of subsection
11-16-3A of this chapter and show evidence that the proposed development will
conform to the official village plan and to the purpose of the PUD district set
forth in section
11-16-1 of this chapter. The village board, with recommendation from the
planning commission, shall grant or deny said application pursuant to the
provisions contained in chapter 3, article A of this title. Approval of the PUD
zoning district shall constitute an expression of approval by the village board
of the application plan as a guide to the preparation of the preliminary PUD
plan. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee in an amount equal
to that prescribed by chapter 3, article A of this title. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-
2004; amd. 2011 Code)
      2.   To reduce the number of steps involved in the approval of a planned
unit development, a preliminary PUD plan meeting the requirements of subsection
B of this section and subsection
11-16-3B of this chapter may be submitted in lieu of an application plan
required in subsection A1 of this section. This type of application shall be
accompanied by a filing fee in an amount equal to one hundred dollars
($100.00).
   B.   Approval Of Preliminary Plan:
      1.   a. Supporting data in accordance with subsection
11-16-3B of this chapter shall be provided.
         b.   Copies of the preliminary PUD plan and supporting data shall be
submitted to the zoning officer for certification as to conformity with these
regulations, recommendations, and suggestions regarding the overall design, if
any.
         c.   Copies of the preliminary PUD plan shall be submitted to the
planning commission who shall hold public hearings on the application for a
preliminary PUD plan giving notice of the times and places as required by state
law by publishing a notice thereof at least once in a publication having
general circulation within the village. Following the public hearings, a
recommendation of approval or denial of the preliminary PUD plan shall be made
by the planning commission to the village board. If needed, the village board
shall review the preliminary PUD plan and grant or deny any exceptions or
variances needed.
      2.   The planning commission shall set forth the reasons for the
recommendation, and said recommendation shall set forth how the proposal would
be in the public interest, including, but not limited to, findings of fact on
the following:
         a.   In what respects the proposed plan is consistent with the stated
purpose of the planned unit development requirements.
         b.   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and
standards of the planned unit development district.
         c.   The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, the density, dimension, area, bulk and use, and
the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest.
         d.   The physical design of the proposed plan and the manner in which
said design makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated common
open space, and furthers the amenities of light, air, recreation, and visual
enjoyment.
         e.   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood.
         f.   The desirability of the proposed plan to the physical
development, tax base, and economic well being of the entire community.
         g.   The conformity with the intent and spirit of the comprehensive
plan.
         h.   Specific points noted on the plan that have impact on its design,
function, and visibility in the community.
      3.   Following receipt of the recommendation by the planning commission
and approval by the village board, the planning commission shall, within sixty
(60) days, recommend approval, modification within limits of a minor change, or
disapproval of the planned unit development plan. As a condition to the
approval of the preliminary PUD plan, the planning commission shall set forth
findings of fact in accord with this section on which they base their approval
and describing how the proposal meets the standards of section
11-16-4 of this chapter.
      4.   All conditions, documents, and plans required by the planning
commission must be delineated on the plat or agreed to in writing prior to
village board approval.
      5.   The planning commission may require such special conditions as they
may deem necessary to ensure conformance with the intent of all comprehensive
plan elements, the stated purpose of the planned development district and
established village policies.
      6.   Approval of a preliminary planned unit development plan shall not
constitute approval of the final plan. Rather it shall be deemed an expression
of approval to the layout submitted on the preliminary plan as a guide to the
preparation of the final plan which will be submitted for approval of the
village. The final plan shall be approved as the final land use and zoning plan
if it conforms substantially with the preliminary land use and zoning plan.
The final plan may be considered as a preliminary and final plan and may be
submitted for preliminary and final approval if all of the land is to be
developed at one time and if all requirements hereof are met. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-
2004)
      7.   The provisions of chapter 3, article A of this title shall be
applicable to the preliminary PUD plan. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004; amd. 2011 Code)
   C.   Approval Of Final Plan: The final planned unit development plan shall
be submitted to the zoning officer who shall refer same to the planning
commission. The final PUD plan shall conform to the preliminary PUD plan as
approved or subject to minor changes, and may be submitted in stages with each
stage reflecting the approved preliminary plan; provided, however, that such
stage conforms to all requirements of these regulations. The required procedure
for approval of a final plan shall be as follows:
      1.   A final planned unit development plan and other supporting data
required for approval shall be in accord with the provisions of section
11-16-3 of this chapter. Final plans must be submitted for approval in
accordance with agreed to scheduling, but not later than five (5) years from
the approval of the preliminary plan by the village board. The village board
may grant an extension in time or the developer may resubmit an application; in
the event that same is not done, the zoning officer shall initiate such zoning
changes as he deems necessary to preserve the public interest. If construction
falls more than two (2) years behind the schedule filed with the final plan,
the plan becomes subject to revocation. The planning commission shall monitor
all pending PUD projects and inform the village board of those six (6) months
or more behind schedule.
      2.   The final plan and supporting data shall be submitted to the zoning
officer for certification that the final plan is in conformity with these
regulations and in agreement with the approved preliminary plan.
      3.   After review of the final plan, the planning commission shall submit
the planned unit development plan to the village board with a recommendation
for approval, disapproval, or approval with minor modifications as reviewed at
the public hearing. Any changes or modifications which arise subsequent to the
public hearing shall be specifically noted and referred to the zoning officer
who shall determine whether the change constitutes a major or minor change and
whether another public hearing is required.
      4.   The village board shall, within sixty (60) days, approve,
disapprove, or extend the time period for another sixty (60) days in taking
action on the final plan.
      5.   All conditions, documents, and plans required by the village board
must be delineated on the plan or agreed to in writing prior to the village
board approval.
   D.   Recording Final Planned Unit Development Plan: The construction of any
public improvement in the planned unit development shall be initiated only
after the final PUD plan has been recorded with the county recorder, and shall
be issued in full conformance with this title.
   E.   Changes In Planned Unit Development: The planned unit development shall
be developed according to the approved and recorded final plan. Recorded
approved plan and supporting data, together with all recorded amendments shall
be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and assignees, and
shall limit and control the use of premises and location of structures in the
planned unit development project as set forth therein.
      1.   Major Changes: A change in the approved preliminary PUD plan or
final PUD plan which alters the concept or intent of the planned unit
development including a change in usage, the configuration, increase in floor
area or the height of buildings, an increase in intensity, a reduction of
proposed open space, a change in road locations or standards, a change in the
final governing agreement, provisions or covenants, or other major changes
shall be approved only by submission of a new preliminary PUD plan in
accordance with the procedures as previously set forth for the approval of
preliminary and final PUD plans. All approved major changes in the final PUD
plan shall be recorded with the county recorder as amendments to the final PUD
plan.
      2.   Minor Changes: The village board may approve minor changes in the
planned unit development which do not change the concept or intent of the
development without going through the preliminary approval steps. Minor changes
shall be any change not defined as a major change. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

      1.   Permitted Open Space Uses: The following uses are permitted in open
space land areas:
         a.   Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example,
woodland, fallow field, or managed meadow).
         b.   Agricultural and horticultural uses, including raising crops or
livestock, wholesale nurseries, and associated buildings, including residences
that are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or
horticultural operation. Specifically excluded are commercial livestock
operations involving swine, poultry, and other animals likely to produce highly
offensive odors.
         c.   Pastureland for horses used solely for recreational purposes.
Equestrian facilities shall be permitted but may not consume more than sixty
five percent (65%) of the minimum required open space land.
         d.   Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for selective
harvesting and sustained yield forestry.
         e.   Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons,
picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low impact passive
recreational uses. Motorized off road vehicles, rifle ranges, and other uses
similar in character and potential impact are specifically excluded.
         f.   Active noncommercial recreation areas, such as ball fields,
playgrounds, courts and bikeways, provided such areas do not consume more than
half of the minimum required open space land or five (5) acres, whichever is
less. Ball fields, playgrounds, and courts shall not be located within one
hundred feet (100') of abutting properties and shall not be illuminated for
activity after dark. Parking facilities for the same shall also be permitted
and shall generally be gravel surfaced, properly drained, provide safe ingress
and egress, and contain no more than ten (10) parking spaces.
         g.   Golf courses may comprise up to seventy five percent (75%) of the
minimum required open space land, but shall not include commercial driving
ranges or miniature golf. Not more than ten percent (10%) of the remaining open
space land may be wetland, submerged, or used for stormwater management. Golf
course parking areas and any associated structures shall not be included within
the minimum open space requirement. Parking and accessways may be paved and
lighted. Golf courses included as part of the open space shall be designed to
maximize the extent of fairways that front along adjacent public roads.

         d.   Dedicated open space land shall generally remain undivided and
may be owned and maintained by a homeowners' association, land trust, another
conservation organization recognized by the village, or by a private individual
(typically as part of noncommon conservation land used for rural resource
activities, such as equestrian facilities, tree nurseries, etc.). However, in
no case shall less than twenty five percent (25%) of the property be available
for the common use and passive enjoyment of the subdivision residents. These
ownership options may be combined so that different parts of the open space
land may be owned by different entities.
         e.   The open space shall include land dedicated for public
recreational use as outlined in the village subdivision regulations.
         f.   Where the proposed development adjoins public parkland, a natural
open space buffer at least fifty feet (50') deep shall be provided within the
development along its common boundary with the parkland, within which no new
structures shall be constructed, nor shall any clearing of trees or understory
growth be permitted (except as may be necessary for street or trail
construction). Where this buffer is unwooded, the village may require

incompatible development.
      6.   To establish a physically attractive pattern of development for the
general welfare of the village.
   B.   The RCO extends along the Rock River within the corporate limits of the
village. The exact boundary of the RCO is delineated on the official village
zoning map. The riverfront corridor overlay district regulations supplement and
control (where inconsistent) the regulations of underlying district(s). All
other applicable provisions and standards of this title and other pertinent
ordinances shall remain in effect. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-17A-2: PERMITTED PRINCIPAL USES:
All uses permitted by right in the underlying zoning district(s). (Ord. 1301,
3-15-2004)

All requirements of the underlying zoning district(s) concerning site planning,
building height, lot area, and yard depths shall remain applicable, except
where modified by this article. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-17A-5: PUBLIC PEDESTRIAN/BIKE EASEMENT:
   A.   Design Standards: For the benefit of the public, access to or along the
riverfront is encouraged. This will serve to provide open areas and vehicle
free areas for use by the general public. The desired design standards for such
access are as follows:
      1.   A public pedestrian/bike easement of at least twenty feet (20') in
width running in continuous length through the property for properties
bordering the river. The easement shall be adjacent to the riverfront, but an
alternative location may be proposed if the riverfront location is not
possible.
      2.   The easement should connect to any adjacent public pedestrian/bike
easement in a physically logical and efficient manner.
      3.   Such pedestrian/bike easement should be located in a safe and
logical fashion and be usable by pedestrians and bicyclists.

maintenance of the asphalt surfacing, lighting, signage, security and fencing
where needed, and any other facilities necessary for the public use along the
pedestrian/bike easement.
   B.   Development Incentives:
      1.   If a public pedestrian/bike easement of at least twenty feet (20')
in width running continuously through the property is provided by the owner,
the maximum building height allowable may be increased up to four (4) stories,
not to exceed fifty feet (50'). The granting of this increase shall also be
dependent upon design and topographical considerations.
      2.   If a public pedestrian/bike easement of at least twenty feet (20')
in width running continuously through the property is provided by the owner,
the required setbacks from the public right of way may be varied as long as
design, floodplain, safety, topographic and view considerations are
satisfactorily addressed; provided, however, the setback may not be reduced to
less than ten feet (10').
      3.   For every four hundred (400) square feet of dedicated public
pedestrian easement, which is at least twenty feet (20') wide, that is provided
by the owner, one parking space may be deducted from the required parking
total. This provision shall not apply to residential use within the RCO.
Regardless of waivers or exemptions hereinabove granted or the requirements set
forth in the off street parking regulations of the village, required parking
spaces shall never be reduced to less than fifty percent (50%) of the normal
required total number of spaces. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-17A-6: TRAFFIC ANALYSIS:
A traffic study shall be required for developments that are expected to
generate large volumes of traffic to and from a site. The analysis shall be
performed by a registered professional engineer. The analysis shall include the
anticipated or projected trip generation per day (ADT) and peak hourly traffic
resulting from the proposed use; access points and driveways to and from the
site; parking areas and number of parking spaces; stacking areas, sight
distances from the access points; distance from proposed access points to
existing intersections and driveways within five hundred feet (500'); and other
information necessary for proper review by the village. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

11-17B-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The intent of the commercial and industrial corridor overlay district
(CICOD) is to supplement the underlying business and industrial zoning
provisions and regulations contained in this title by providing additional
rules and regulations for development of lands within the CICOD. The CICOD is
hereby established on all lands which are presently or hereafter may become
zoned business or industrial under the provisions of this title; provided, that
such lands are located contiguous to or within three hundred feet (300') of any
arterial public roadway referred to in subsection C of this section. Once land
comes within the CICOD, the land shall remain in the CICOD during all the time
it retains its business or industrial zoning designation. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008;
amd. 2011 Code)
   B.   Any public road or service road which runs parallel to and within one
hundred feet (100') of an arterial public roadway right of way shall be
considered the same as an arterial public roadway. In addition, any such
contiguous tract of land, regardless of size, that is developed as a single
unit or as a planned unit development (PUD) shall conform to the CICOD.
   C.   The list of arterial public roadways included in the CICOD is as
follows:
      1.   1st Avenue from 6th Street West to the east village limits.
      2.   1st Street (Highway 67) from 1st Avenue south to the village limits.
      3.   3rd Street West from 1st Avenue to 4th Avenue.
      4.   4th Street West from 1st Avenue to 11th Avenue.
      5.   10th Avenue (Andalusia-Knoxville Road) from the east village limits
to the west village limits.
      6.   4th Avenue from 4th Street West to 4th Street East.
      7.   Knoxville Road from 10th Avenue southeast to the village limits.
   D.   The commercial and industrial corridor overlay district shall include,
in addition to the lands hereinbefore referred to, all lands located within the
village lying west of 1st Street (U.S. Route 67) and south of 20th Avenue West
and lying west of 4th Street West and south of Blackhawk View 4th Addition, the
southerly boundary of which land is the Rock Island/Milan Parkway and westerly
boundary of which land is the easterly village limits.
   E.   Where the CICOD boundary line divides a lot or tract of land, the size
and shape of which is on record in the county recorder's office at the
effective date hereof, this article shall apply to the entire lot or tract of
land in the event that the area of the portion of such lot or tract lying
outside the three hundred foot (300') line is less than the area of said lot or
tract lying within such three hundred foot (300') line.
   F.   The purpose of this section is to implement development standards
applicable to various classifications of CICOD overlay districts as designated
by the appropriate authority, in accordance with this title. The standards
contained herein are intended to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
motoring public by preventing or reducing traffic congestion and distracting
visual clutter associated with developments along major thoroughfares in the
village. The standards achieve the stated purpose and intent by addressing the
following physical characteristics of development: buffer and landscaping,
access, lighting, outdoor storage, architecture of buildings and signage.
Guiding principles serve as the benchmarks and overall design objectives to
create attractive places. They are:
      1.   Create efficient and compact commercial and mixed use clusters.
      2.   Promote quality architectural and site design.
      3.   Maintain and enhance natural areas and parklands.
      4.   Connect green infrastructure by linking parklands and integrating
greenways throughout the building environment.
      5.   Add value to the surrounding neighborhoods.
      6.   Provide safe, efficient and convenient transportation systems in the
overlay area including travel between development clusters.
      7.   Create attractive walkways that are safe, comfortable and appealing.
      8.   Install street furniture along internal roads to reinforce image and
comfort.
      9.   Establish a green character for the area with landscaping that does
not block site views of retail businesses.
      10.   Vary roofs and facade designs to provide architectural interest.
      11.   Design attractive signage and gateways to the development and
development clusters.
      12.   Promote sustainable building design and practices.
   G.   In addition to the standards contained in this article, all other
applicable regulations in this title shall apply. In the event that any zoning
ordinance should conflict with the provisions contained in this article, the
provisions of this article shall control.
   H.   Unless otherwise specified in an ordinance creating a CICOD, when any
lot or use is partially located within a CICOD, the remainder of the lot or use
shall be subject to the provisions of this article.
   I.   All plans and designs for facilities within the CICOD shall be
submitted to a design review committee of the planning commission for approval
prior to the issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-2: BUFFER REQUIREMENTS:
Unless other sections of this title require a greater buffer width, a proposed
development shall provide a buffer area along the CICOD road in accordance with
section
11-17B-16, table 17B-1 of this article. These buffer areas shall be subject to
the following development standards:
   A.   No uses shall be allowed within the buffer area except:
Minimal utility crossings.
Permitted entrances.
Signs as allowed in this article.
Trails and stormwater management facilities which are an integral part of a
landscape plan.
Utility easements that parallel the roadway and are located along the edge of
the buffer area and serve to extend utilities to adjacent properties.
   B.   Notwithstanding the requirements in subsection A of this section, on
site sewage disposal systems shall be allowed within buffer areas where no
alternative location exists.
   C.   The buffer width may vary by up to twenty percent (20%) from the
minimum width required at any point along the property line, as long as the
buffer area provided remains equal to the minimum buffer area required. (Ord.
1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-3: LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The buffer area shall be landscaped in accordance with section
11-17B-16, table 17B-1 of this article. Minimum standards for plantings shall
be in accordance with chapter 22, "Landscape And Buffer Yard Requirements", of
this title.
   B.   Buffer plantings shall include a combination of evergreen and deciduous
trees and shrubs with a minimum of twenty five percent (25%) and a maximum of
fifty percent (50%) of the required plant units consisting of evergreens.
   C.   Existing mature trees, particularly historic and specimen trees, within
the buffer area shall be retained whenever feasible. Selective clearing shall
be permitted upon submission of a tree protection plan and if approved by the
design review committee.
   D.   Where existing mature trees at least six inches (6") (150 millimeters)
in diameter at breast height (dbh) within the buffer area are retained, a
credit of 1.25 may be taken towards the planting requirements where the minimum
save area is two hundred fifty (250) square feet (23.23 square meters). Where
the minimum save area is nine hundred (900) square feet (83.61 square meters)
or greater, the credit may be increased to 1.5. Also, where transplanted trees
are four inches (4") (100 millimeters) dbh or larger at the time of planting, a
credit of 1.25 may be taken towards the planting requirements only when an
irrigation system is installed.
   E.   A berm may be substituted for fifty percent (50%) of the plant unit
requirement. The berm shall be graded to appear smooth, rounded and
naturalistic. The berm shall be at least three feet (3') (1.22 meters) higher
than the elevation of the adjacent ground. Its slope shall not exceed three to
one (3:1), except in unusual situations where a two to one (2:1) slope would be
allowed with special ground cover.
   F.   Landscape designs must consider and be compatible with landscaping on
existing adjacent uses. The choice of species and type of trees should:
      1.   Achieve unity of design by repetition of plant varieties and other
materials and by correlating with adjacent developments and with the
streetscape plantings where provided.
      2.   Extend the disease resisting strategies required within a property
to adjoining properties. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-4: ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE FOR BUFFER AND LANDSCAPING:
   A.   The buffer and landscape standards of section
11-17B-3 of this article are not intended to be arbitrary or to inhibit
creative solutions. Project or site conditions may arise where normal
compliance is impractical or impossible, or where maximum achievement of the
objectives can be obtained through alternative compliance.
   B.   Requests for alternative compliance for any application shall be
accepted for review when one or more of the following conditions are met:
      1.   Site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible or
impractical; or improved environmental or architectural quality would result
from the alternative compliance.
      2.   Space limitations or unusual shape of existing lots is such that
full compliance is impossible or impractical.
      3.   Prevailing landscaping practices designed to achieve an overall
effect in the surrounding neighborhood may justify alternative compliance. For
example, a streetscape plan has been established and implemented along a
particular corridor.
      4.   Safety conditions, such as sight distance, make alternative
compliance necessary.
      5.   Change of use on the existing site increases the buffer area more
than is feasible to provide. For example, the required buffer would encroach on
the existing use and its ancillary use or would encompass more than ten percent
(10%) of the existing parcel area.
      6.   Existing mature trees could be saved near, but not within, the
buffer, as long as the intent of the buffer is met.
      7.   The proposed use and its accessories are located a significant
distance from the right of way, and the buffer area will remain undisturbed,
with the exception of possible supplementary plantings.
      8.   When a rural cluster development is proposed and a significant
portion of the required open space is located between the home sites and the
CICOD designated rural roadway, and/or the home sites are screened from the
CICOD roadway by existing vegetation or terrain.
   C.   Requests for alternative compliance shall be submitted to the design
review committee prior to or as part of the development plan submission or
concurrent with the submission of an application for rezoning or special use
permit. The request shall be accompanied by sufficient detail and
justification, written and/or graphic, to allow for an appropriate evaluation
and decision. The alternative method of compliance must be comparable to the
minimum standards in terms of quality and effectiveness. The request shall be
limited to the specific project under review. The design review committee or
designee shall evaluate the alternatives and accept or modify them. (Ord. 1468,
4-7-2008)
11-17B-5: ACCESS TO CICOD ROAD:
   A.   Access along all arterials within the CICOD shall be minimized to the
extent feasible and as determined by the appropriate authorities.
   B.   In any event, parcels of land existing at the time the CICOD is created
shall not be denied access to the CICOD roadway if no reasonable joint or
cooperative access is feasible.
   C.   Project or site conditions may arise where normal compliance is
impractical or impossible, or where maximum achievement of the objectives can
only be obtained through alternative compliance. Requests for alternative
compliance for any application shall be accepted for review when one or more of
the following conditions are met:
      1.   In the event that wetlands or other significant environmental
features prevent this separation.
      2.   In the event that safety considerations in terms of vertical or
horizontal sight distance prevent this separation.
      3.   In the event that unusual requirements of the uses dictate site
circulation patterns that necessitate alternative access points.
      4.   Requests for alternative compliance shall be submitted to the design
review committee prior to or as part of the development plan submission
requirements or concurrent with the submission of an application for a special
use permit. The request shall be accompanied by sufficient detail and
justification, written and/or graphic, to allow an appropriate evaluation and
decision. The alternative method of compliance must be comparable to the
current standards in terms of effectiveness and safety and shall be limited to
the specific project under review. The design review committee shall evaluate
the alternatives and accept or modify them. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-6: PARKING LOT DESIGN AND LIGHTING:
Where parking areas are required:
   A.   Internal areas of parking lots should include plantings and
infiltration areas for stormwater.
   B.   All parking lot lighting shall be subject to the following standards
and shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines (see section
11-17B-13 of this article):
      1.   Lighting must be contained on the site using shielded fixtures, full
cutoff, recessed, flush lenses, or comparable standards so as to protect the
public from exposure to the direct light of the fixture and to minimize the
amount of light that is directed to the sky;
      2.   Parking lot lights may be incorporated into the streetlight scheme
to illuminate public and private streets, sidewalks and pedestrian, bike and
hiking trails, if acceptable to the design review committee;
      3.   Light pole height shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines. Light
poles located within two hundred feet (200') (60.96 meters) of the CICOD right
of way shall not exceed twenty four feet (24') (7.32 meters) in height
(including the support). For shopping centers and large sites, the height could
be increased to thirty three feet (33') (10.97 meters) (including the support)
to minimize the number of lighting fixtures.
   C.   Parking areas should have clearly designated pedestrian walks. These
walks should, at a minimum, be striped. Main walks are encouraged to be marked
through changes in grade, materials, colors, or with other formal sidewalk
changes.
   D.   The site should be configured to conceal loading docks, storage, etc.,
from view from the highway and parking lots.
   E.   Shared parking with internal circulation between properties to limit
curb cuts on public streets and limit the need for excessive parking areas is
encouraged.
   F.   Five percent (5%) of every parking lot shall be landscaped in
compliance with the landscape formula.
   G.   Parking lots shall be located no less than six feet (6') from any
portion of any building. This six foot (6') space may include landscaping as
appropriate.
   H.   Subject to the approval of the zoning officer, alternate landscaping
plans may be substituted for consideration. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-7: DECORATIVE EXTERIOR FLOODLIGHTING:
Decorative exterior floodlighting shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines.
When permitted, all decorative exterior floodlighting shall consist of an
appropriate composition of brightness, textures and colors to dramatize a
setting and extend the hours of the setting's usefulness. Floodlighting
fixtures shall be located and shielded by structure and lenses so as to protect
the public from exposure to the direct light of the fixture and to minimize the
amount of light that is directed to the night sky. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-8: OUTDOOR STORAGE:
All outdoor storage, service areas, refuse removal areas, and loading areas
shall be screened from the view of all public rights of way by a solid board
fence, masonry wall consisting of either brick, "split face" or "rock face"
masonry units, or dense evergreen plant materials. All such screening shall be
of a sufficient height to screen storage areas from view. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-9: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: The standards of this section are intended to
enhance the appearance of buildings and promote a high quality of design in
order to improve the aesthetic appeal and overall image of the village. The
intent of these standards is to:
      1.   Encourage greater design compatibility with surrounding areas and
establish a precedent for high quality design in areas with no established
character;
      2.   Achieve greater architectural variation and interest through
standards for the design of roofs, exterior walls and the use of exterior
finish materials;
      3.   Encourage greater architectural cohesiveness and compatibility
within a new development of multiple buildings; and
      4.   Reduce the negative visual impact of features and site improvements
such as mechanical equipment. These standards are intended to be applied
together with other development standards as set forth in this title.
   B.   General Application:
      1.   New Construction: These standards shall apply to new construction of
buildings and structures as specified in the following subsections.
      2.   Improvements To Existing Structures And Development Sites:
         a.   These standards shall apply to existing buildings only when a
building expansion or a series of expansions exceeds twenty five percent (25%)
of the existing floor area measured on a cumulative basis starting from the
effective date hereof.
         b.   It is intended that a building expansion subject to these
standards be reasonably integrated with the existing structure or site
condition consistent with these standards.
         c.   These standards shall not be construed to necessitate
improvements to existing buildings or site conditions beyond those necessary to
integrate the proposed improvement with existing conditions in a manner
consistent with these standards.
      3.   Development Or Permit Applications: These standards shall not apply
to any complete development, zoning or building permit application submitted or
approved prior to the effective date hereof.
      4.   Exemption For Historic Buildings: These standards shall not apply to
designated historic structures certified by the state historic preservation
office.
   C.   Compliance:
      1.   Compliance standards set forth in this article are mandatory, unless
the design review committee grants alternative compliance in accordance with
the following provisions. The design review committee may allow application of
an alternative standard, provided the design review committee determines that
the applicant has demonstrated that either:
         a.   Site specific, physical constraints necessitate application of
the alternative standard, and such constraints will not allow a reasonable use
of the property without application of such alternative standard; or
         b.   The alternative standard achieves the intent of the subject
standard to the same or greater degree than the subject standard and results in
equivalent or greater benefits to the community as would compliance with the
subject standard.
      2.   Whenever the design review committee grants alternative compliance,
the design review committee shall formulate a written statement of findings
based on the above criteria for such action. Such statement shall be filed in
the development application file.
      3.   Decisions by the design review committee with respect to such
alternative compliance may be appealed to the zoning board of appeals.
   D.   Commercial (Nonindustrial) Architectural Standards:
      1.   Application:
         a.   The standards of this subsection apply to retail, office,
institutional and other commercial buildings located in business zoned or
designated areas. In the case of business or commercially designated areas
within a planned unit development, or such uses subject to special review,
standards negotiated as part of a planned unit development, or as may be
required by the findings of the special review, may be different or more
stringent than those set forth in this subsection. These standards shall not
apply to buildings located in industrially zoned or designated areas.
         b.   It is intended that these standards apply to the primary facade
of the building and that all sides of the building, where visible from public
rights of way and private roads or service drives or adjacent residential
neighborhoods, shall include design characteristics and materials consistent
with those of the primary facade, except as provided in subsection D2 of this
section. Also, standards specified in subsection E of this section shall be
limited to the facade and walls as specified in said subsection E. (Ord. 1468,
4-7-2008)
      2.   Exceptions: The design review committee may waive the application of
the standards set forth in this article in cases where the visibility of side
or rear walls of the building is substantially diminished by landscaping, or by
a decorative screening wall or earthen berm combined with landscaping, located
between the building wall and any such right of way or adjacent property.
Landscape screening shall be designed to be at least sixty percent (60%) opaque
to a height of six feet (6') upon installation and a minimum of eighty percent
(80%) opaque to a height of six feet (6') within five (5) years of planting.
Such landscaping shall consist of primarily evergreen plant material to provide
year round screening. The required landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy
condition by the current owner. In the event any required landscaping material
dies or is destroyed, it shall be replaced by the owner within six (6) months.
Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of the landscape
plan. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
      3.   Design Compatibility:
         a.   Building design shall contribute to the special or unique
characteristics of an area and/or development through the use of predominant
building massing and scale, building materials, architectural elements and
color palette.
         b.   Design compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as
the repetition of rooflines, the use of similar proportions in building mass
and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and
door patterns, and/or the use of building materials that have color shades and
textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed
development.
         c.   Where there is no established or consistent neighborhood or area
character of a unifying theme, or where it is not desirable to continue the
existing character because it does not reflect a design theme consistent with
the architectural standards as described in this article, the proposed
development shall be designed to establish an attractive image and set a
standard of quality for future developments and buildings within the area.
Greater attention to design with respect to design compatibility standards in
this subsection D3c shall be required in areas of high visibility, such as
community entryways and arterial and major collector roadways including Rock
Island-Milan Parkway, 15th Avenue/Airport Road, 10th Avenue/Andalusia Road/
Indian Bluff Road, Knoxville Road and U.S. 67/1st Street and 4th Street West.
(Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
      4.   Articulation Of Walls: Facades, and any wall of the building facing
any road or public or private service drive, greater than one hundred feet
(100') in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses having a depth of at least four percent (4%) of the
length of the facade, extending at least twenty percent (20%) of the length of
the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one hundred
(100) horizontal feet. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
      5.   Delivery/Loading Doors And Docks: No delivery, loading, dock or
trash removal door or facility shall be located on the main street facing the
facade of the building. Any such door or facility shall be located on the side
or rear wall of the building. For sites that have road frontage on multiple
sides, these facilities shall be located in the least obtrusive manner,
preferably on a nonroad facing side of the building, or the road frontage that
has the least public visibility. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
      6.   Rooftop Mechanical Units: Rooftop mechanical units and other
miscellaneous rooftop equipment shall be substantially screened from view from
public rights of way and other public places. Screening materials shall be of
the same or comparable material, texture and color as the materials used on the
building. Roof mounted equipment screening shall be constructed as an
encompassing monolithic unit rather than several individual screens (i.e.,
multiple equipment screens, or "hats", surrounding individual elements shall
not be permitted). The height of the screening element shall equal or exceed
the height of the structure's tallest piece of installed equipment. (Ord. 1468,
4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
      7.   Building Colors: Colors shall be used to blend buildings into an
area and to unify elements of a development. Color should be drawn from the
surrounding area and, if in a new development area, shall be selected to
establish an attractive image and set a standard of quality for future
developments and buildings within the area. Monotonous or monochromatic color
palettes are strongly discouraged. Accent colors used to call attention to a
particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern,
shall be compatible with predominant building base colors and may be
incorporated using such elements as shutters, window mullions, building trim
and awnings. Accent colors shall cover no more than five percent (5%) of a
building facade.
      8.   Illumination: Illumination highlighting the entire facade of a
building, or a significant portion of the building, or back lighted translucent
awnings intended to function as signage, shall not be permitted as part of a
building design. This standard is not intended to preclude the use of lighting
(including neon lighting) to accent limited portions of the building facade.
      9.   Cart Storage And Vending Machines: Cart storage areas, vending
machines, and video and book return containers shall be placed inside the
principal building, placed in an accessory structure designed to complement the
principal building, or screened with walls and landscaping.
      10.   Multi-Building Developments: Developments with multiple buildings
shall include predominant characteristics in each building so that the
buildings within the development appear to be part of a cohesive, planned area,
yet are not monotonous in design. Predominant characteristics may include use
of the same or similar architectural style, materials and colors.
      11.   Building Entrances: Primary public entrances shall be clearly
defined and recessed and projected or framed by elements such as awnings,
arcades, porticoes or other architectural features.
      12.   Franchise Architecture: Prototypical or franchise architectural
designs may be required to be modified to meet these architectural standards.
Changes to prototypical franchise styles to meet these standards may include,
but not be limited to, modifications to roofs, windows, doors, building mass,
materials, colors, placement of architectural features and details, etc. Care
should be taken to ensure that such modifications comply with subsection D3,
"Design Compatibility", of this section. Franchise architectural styles found
to meet these standards will not require any modification.
      13.   Metal Siding: Metal siding may be used as an exterior finish
material as long as the amount used does not exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of the area of any single wall, exclusive of the roof, and provided it matches
or complements the building color and/or material scheme. Further, such metal
siding shall be a "standing seam" type or equivalent quality, not a
"corrugated" type. Architectural metals, such as bronze, brass, copper and
wrought iron, may be used and may exceed the twenty five percent (25%) area
limit.
      14.   Building Design Elements: All buildings shall be designed and
maintained using the following building elements, with a minimum of one item
each selected from four (4) of the five (5) groups below: (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
         a.   Group 1 - Exterior Wall Articulation:

            (2)   Ornamental lighting fixtures (excluding neon) for all
exterior building lighting; or
            (3)   A feature that adds architectural definition to the building
in a manner equivalent to subsection D14e(1) or D14e(2) of this section. (Ord.
1468, 4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
   E.   Industrial Architectural Standards:
      1.   Purpose And Intent: These standards are intended to apply to
industrial buildings on sites adjacent to major roads within the CICOD because
of the visibility of such development and its impact on the image and character
of the community. Industrial development that is not adjacent to collector or
local roads is not subject to these standards.
      2.   Application: Standards in this subsection apply to industrial
buildings located in industrial districts and areas within planned unit
developments designated for industrial use that are located on sites adjacent
to a major or minor arterial road, as defined by the appropriate jurisdiction
and within the CICOD.
         a.   Sites adjacent to public or private service roads, where there is
no developed or developable private land between the service road and the
arterial road, shall be considered adjacent to such arterial roads or
interstate highways and shall be subject to these standards. This shall include
sites on service roads separated from the arterial or interstate road by public
or private commuter facilities or other public facilities within the right of
way.
         b.   In the case of industrial designated areas within a planned unit
development, or industrial uses subject to special use review, standards
negotiated as part of a planned unit development, or as may be required by the
findings of the special review, may be different or more stringent than those
set forth in this subsection.
         c.   Subsection B, "General Application", of this section, which
addresses how standards apply to new construction and existing buildings, and
subsection C, "Compliance", of this section also shall apply to standards in
this subsection.
      3.   Design Compatibility:
         a.   Building design shall contribute to the special or unique
characteristics of an area and/or development through the use of predominant
building massing and scale, building materials, architectural elements and
color palette.
         b.   Design compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as
the repetition of rooflines, the use of similar proportions in building mass
and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and
door patterns, and/or the use of building materials that have color shades and
textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed
development.
         c.   Where there is no established or consistent neighborhood or area
character or unifying theme, or where it is not desirable to continue the
existing character because it does not reflect a design theme consistent with
the architectural standards as described in this article, the proposed
development shall be designed to establish an attractive image and set a
standard of quality for future developments and buildings within the area.
Greater attention to design with respect to design compatibility standards in
this subsection E3c shall be required in areas of high visibility, such as
community entryways and arterial and major collector roadways including Rock
Island-Milan Parkway, 1st Avenue/Airport Road, 10th Avenue/Andalusia Road/
Indian Bluff Road, Knoxville Road, and U.S. 67/1st Street. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-
2008)
      4.   Articulation Of Walls: Facades, and any wall of the building facing
any road or public or private service drive, greater than one hundred feet
(100') in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses having a depth of at least four percent (4%) of the
length of the facade, extending at least twenty percent (20%) of the length of
the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one hundred
(100) horizontal feet. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
      5.   Delivery/Loading Doors And Docks: No delivery, loading, dock or
trash removal door or facility shall be located on the main street facing the
facade of the building. Any such door or facility shall be located on the side
or rear wall of the building. For sites that have road frontage on multiple
sides, these facilities shall be located in the least obtrusive manner,
preferably on a nonroad facing side of the building, or the road frontage that
has the least public visibility. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
      6.   Rooftop Mechanical Units: Rooftop mechanical units and other
miscellaneous rooftop equipment shall be substantially screened from view from
public rights of way and other public places. Screening materials shall be of
the same or comparable material, texture and color as the materials used on the
building. Roof mounted equipment screening shall be constructed as an
encompassing monolithic unit rather than several individual screens (i.e.,
multiple equipment screens, or "hats", surrounding individual elements shall
not be permitted). The height of the screening element shall equal or exceed
the height of the structure's tallest piece of installed equipment. (Ord. 1468,
4-7-2008; amd. 2011 Code)
      7.   Building Colors: Colors shall be used to blend buildings into an
area and to unify elements of a development. Color should be drawn from the
surrounding area and, if in a new development area, shall be selected to
establish an attractive image and set a standard of quality for future
developments and buildings within the area. Monotonous or monochromatic color
palettes are strongly discouraged. Accent colors used to call attention to a
particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern,
shall be compatible with the predominant building base colors and may be
incorporated using such elements as shutters, window mullions, building trim
and awnings. Accent colors shall cover no more than five percent (5%) of a
building facade.
      8.   Illumination: Illumination highlighting the entire facade of a
building, or a significant portion of the building, or back lighted translucent
awnings intended to function as signage shall not be permitted as part of a
building design. This standard is not intended to preclude the use of lighting
(including neon lighting) to accent limited portions of the building facade.
      9.   Metal Siding: Metal siding may be used as an exterior finish
material as long as the amount used does not exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of the area of any single wall, exclusive of the roof, and provided it matches
or complements the building color and/or material scheme. Further, such metal
siding shall be a "standing seam" type or equivalent quality, not a
"corrugated" type. Architectural metals, such as bronze, brass, copper and
wrought iron, may be used and may exceed the twenty five percent (25%) area
limit.
      10.   Facade Building Materials: Any wall of a building facing a road or
a public or private service drive shall be constructed of the following (the
area of windows and doors, including overhead doors, shall be excluded from the
wall area calculation for the following standards): (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
         a.   At least two (2) kinds of materials distinctively different in
texture or masonry pattern, at least one of which is decorative block, brick or
stone, with each of the required materials covering at least twenty five
percent (25%) of the exterior walls of the building; or (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008;
amd. 2011 Code)
         b.   Brick or stone (including synthetic stone) covering at least
fifty percent (50%) of the exterior walls of the building. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-
2008)
11-17B-10: LOADING SPACES:
On sites along major arterials or higher classified roadways, loading spaces
shall be located only within side and rear yards and shall be out of view of
the major roadway and not in conflict with internal parking spaces and
circulation. Loading requirements shall be as specified in chapter 18 of this
title. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-11: UTILITY LINES AND STRUCTURES:
Utility lines shall be located so as to minimize disturbance of any tree of
fifteen inch (15") caliper or greater on site. All junction and access boxes,
when located on sites along the CICOD designated roadways, shall be screened
from view with landscaping. All utilities shall be placed underground
regardless of the underlying zoning district. New and relocated utilities are
to be placed outside of the right of way of the CICOD designated roadways.
(Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)
11-17B-12: FENCES:
Fences erected after the effective date hereof on sites located along CICOD
designated roadways shall be located in the side or rear yard only. (Ord. 1468,
4-7-2008)
11-17B-13: COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION:
Certain structures in certain locations will require the submission of a
"notice of proposed construction or alteration" (FAA form 7460-1) to the FAA
prior to the final approval of construction plans. (Ord. 1468, 4-7-2008)

11-17C-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The intent of the highway corridor overlay district (HCOD) is to
supplement the underlying business and industrial zoning provisions and
regulations contained in this title by providing additional rules and
regulations for development of lands within the HCOD. The HCOD is hereby
established on all lands along the Rock Island-Milan Parkway (parkway)
corridor, which are presently or hereafter may become zoned business or
industrial under the provisions of this title. All lands contiguous to or
within six hundred feet (600') of the parkway shall be subject to the HCOD. In
addition, any such contiguous tract of land, regardless of size, that is
developed as a single unit or as a planned unit development (PUD) shall conform
to the HCOD. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007; amd. 2011 Code)
   B.   The purpose of this article is to implement development standards
applicable to various classifications of highway corridor overlay districts, as
designated by the appropriate authority, in accordance with this title. The
standards contained herein are intended to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the motoring public by preventing or reducing traffic congestion and
distracting visual clutter associated with developments along major
thoroughfares in the village. The standards achieve the stated purpose and
intent by addressing the following physical characteristics of development:
buffer and landscaping, access, lighting, outdoor storage, architecture of
buildings and signage. Guiding principles serve as the benchmarks and overall
design objectives to create attractive places. They are:
      1.   Create efficient and compact commercial and mixed use clusters.
      2.   Promote quality architectural and site design.
      3.   Maintain and enhance natural areas and parklands.
      4.   Connect green infrastructure by linking parklands and integrating
greenways throughout the building environment.
      5.   Add value to the surrounding neighborhoods.
      6.   Provide safe, efficient and convenient transportation systems in the
overlay area including travel between development clusters.
      7.   Create attractive walkways that are safe, comfortable and appealing.
      8.   Install street furniture along internal roads to reinforce image and
comfort.
      9.   Establish a green character for the area with landscaping that does
not block site views of retail businesses.
      10.   Vary roofs and facade designs to provide architectural interest.
      11.   Design attractive signage and gateways to the development and
development clusters.
      12.   Promote sustainable building design and practices.
   C.   In addition to the standards contained in this article, all other
applicable regulations in this title shall apply. In the event that any zoning
ordinance should conflict with the provisions contained in this article, the
provisions of this article shall control.
   D.   Unless otherwise specified in an ordinance creating an HCOD, when any
lot or use is partially located within an HCOD, the remainder of the lot or use
shall be subject to the provisions of this article.
   E.   All plans and designs for facilities within the HCOD shall be submitted
to a design review committee of the planning commission for approval prior to
the issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-2: BUFFER REQUIREMENTS:
Unless other sections of this title require a greater buffer width, a proposed
development shall provide a buffer area along the HCOD road in accordance with
section
11-17C-16, table 17C-1 of this article. These buffer areas shall be subject to
the following development standards:
   A.   The buffer area for residential uses shall be platted as a separate lot
deeded to a homeowners' association or as a buffer on individual lots with
appropriate deed restrictions.
   B.   The minimum yard depth for residential uses required by this title
shall be provided outside the buffer area.
   C.   No uses shall be allowed within the buffer area except:
Minimal utility crossings.
Permitted entrances.
Signs as allowed in this article.
Trails and stormwater management facilities which are an integral part of a
landscape plan.
Utility easements in rural and suburban parkway sections which parallel the
parkway and are located along the edge of the buffer area and which serve to
extend utilities to adjacent properties.
   D.   Notwithstanding the requirements in subsection C of this section, on
site sewage disposal systems shall be allowed within buffer areas where no
alternative location exists.
   E.   The buffer width may vary by up to twenty percent (20%) from the
minimum width required at any point along the property line, as long as the
buffer area provided remains equal to the minimum buffer area required. (Ord.
1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-3: LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The buffer area shall be landscaped in accordance with section
11-17C-16, table 17C-1 of this article. Minimum standards for plantings shall
be in accordance with chapter 22, "Landscape And Buffer Yard Requirements", of
this title. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
   B.   Buffer plantings shall include a combination of evergreen and deciduous
trees and shrubs. For nonresidential uses, a minimum of twenty five percent
(25%) and a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of the required plant units shall
consist of evergreens and ornamentals and shall include at least one deciduous
shade tree per one hundred (100) linear feet of frontage. For residential
buffers, a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required plant units shall
consist of evergreens and ornamentals which provide effective screening. (Ord.
1465, 3-3-2008)
   C.   Existing mature trees, particularly historic and specimen trees, within
the buffer area shall be retained whenever feasible. Selective clearing shall
be permitted upon submission of a tree protection plan and if approved by the
design review committee.
   D.   Where existing mature trees at least six inches (6") (150 millimeters)
in diameter at breast height (dbh) within the buffer area are retained, a
credit of 1.25 may be taken towards the planting requirements where the minimum
save area is two hundred fifty (250) square feet (23.23 square meters). Where
the minimum save area is nine hundred (900) square feet (83.61 square meters)
or greater, the credit may be increased to 1.5. Also, where transplanted trees
are four inches (4") (100 millimeters) dbh or larger at the time of planting, a
credit of 1.25 may be taken towards the planting requirement only when an
irrigation system is installed.
   E.   A berm may be substituted for fifty percent (50%) of the plant unit
requirement. The berm shall be graded to appear smooth, rounded and
naturalistic. The berm shall be at least four feet (4') (1.22 meters) higher
than the elevation of the adjacent ground. Its slope shall not exceed three to
one (3:1), except in unusual situations where a two to one (2:1) slope could be
allowed with special ground cover.
   F.   Landscape designs must consider and be compatible with landscaping on
existing adjacent uses. The choice of species and type of trees should:
      1.   Achieve unity of design by repetition of plant varieties and other
materials and by correlating with adjacent developments and with the
streetscape plantings where provided.
      2.   Extend the disease resisting strategies required within a property
to adjoining properties. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-4: ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE FOR BUFFER AND LANDSCAPING:
   A.   The buffer and landscape standards of section
11-17C-3 of this article are not intended to be arbitrary or to inhibit
creative solutions. Project or site conditions may arise where normal
compliance is impractical or impossible or where maximum achievement of the
objectives can be obtained through alternative compliance.
   B.   Requests for alternative compliance for any application shall be
accepted for review when one or more of the following conditions are met:
      1.   Site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible or
impractical; or improved environmental or architectural quality would result
from the alternative compliance.
      2.   Space limitations or unusual shape of existing lots are such that
full compliance is impossible or impractical.
      3.   Prevailing landscaping practices designed to achieve an overall
effect in the surrounding neighborhood may justify alternative compliance. For
example, a streetscape plan has been established and implemented along a
particular corridor.
      4.   Safety conditions, such as sight distance, make alternative
compliance necessary.
      5.   Change of use on the existing site increases the buffer area more
than is feasible to provide. For example, the required buffer would encroach on
the existing use and its ancillary use or would encompass more than ten percent
(10%) of the existing parcel area.
      6.   Existing mature trees could be saved near, but not within, the
buffer, as long as the intent of the buffer is met.
      7.   The proposed use and its accessories are located a significant
distance from the right of way and the buffer area will remain undisturbed,
with the exception of possible supplementary plantings.
      8.   When a rural cluster development is proposed and a significant
portion of the required open space is located between the homesites and the
HCOD designated rural parkway, and/or the homesites are screened from the HCOD
roadway by existing vegetation or terrain.
   C.   Requests for alternative compliance shall be submitted to the design
review committee prior to or as part of the development plan submission or
concurrent with the submission of an application for rezoning or special use
permit. The request shall be accompanied by sufficient detail and
justification, written and/or graphic, to allow for an appropriate evaluation
and decision. The alternative method of compliance must be comparable to the
minimum standards in terms of quality and effectiveness. The request shall be
limited to the specific project under review. The design review committee or
the designee shall evaluate the alternatives and accept or modify them. (Ord.
1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-5: ACCESS TO HCOD ROAD:
   A.   Access along the parkway has already been predetermined by the Illinois
department of transportation and the county. Access along all arterials within
the HCOD will be separated by three hundred fifty feet (350').
   B.   In any event, parcels of land existing at the time the HCOD is created
shall not be denied access to the HCOD roadway if no reasonable joint or
cooperative access is feasible.
   C.   1. The above separation distances are not intended to be arbitrary.
Project or site conditions may arise where normal compliance is impractical or
impossible, or where maximum achievement of the objectives can only be obtained
through alternative compliance.
      2.   Requests for alternative compliance for any application shall be
accepted for review when one or more of the following conditions are met:
         a.   In the event that wetlands or other significant environmental
features prevent this separation.
         b.   In the event that safety considerations in terms of vertical or
horizontal sight distance prevent this separation.
         c.   In the event that unusual requirements of the uses dictate site
circulation patterns that necessitate alternative access points.
      3.   Requests for alternative compliance shall be submitted to the design
review committee prior to or as part of the development plan submission
requirements or concurrent with the submission of an application for a special
use permit. The request shall be accompanied by sufficient detail and
justification, written and/or graphic, to allow an appropriate evaluation and
decision. The alternative method of compliance must be comparable to the
current standards in terms of effectiveness and safety and shall be limited to
the specific project under review. The design review committee shall evaluate
the alternatives and accept or modify them. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-6: PARKING LOT DESIGN AND LIGHTING:
Where parking areas are required:
   A.   When any building or portion of a building is located within one
hundred twenty feet (120') of the parkway, there shall be no more than two (2)
single loaded rows of parking between that portion of the building and the
parkway. Additional parking should be located along the other sides of the
building. When feasible, berms should be used to shield parking from view from
the roadway.
   B.   Internal areas of parking lots should include plantings and
infiltration areas for stormwater.
   C.   All parking lot lighting shall be subject to the following standards
and shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines (see section
11-17C-13 of this article):
      1.   Lighting must be contained on the site using shielded fixtures, full
cutoff, recessed, flush lenses, or comparable standards so as to protect the
public from exposure to the direct light of the fixture and to minimize the
amount of light that is directed to the sky.
      2.   Parking lot lights may be incorporated into the streetlight scheme
to illuminate public and private streets, sidewalks and pedestrian, bike and
hiking trails, if acceptable to the design review committee.
      3.   Light pole height shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines. Light
poles located within two hundred feet (200') (60.96 meters) of the HCOD right
of way shall not exceed twenty four feet (24') (7.32 meters) in height
(including the support). For shopping centers and large sites, the height could
be increased to thirty three feet (33') (10.97 meters) (including the support)
to minimize the number of lighting fixtures.
   D.   Parking areas should have clearly designated pedestrian walks. These
walks should, at a minimum, be striped. Main walks are encouraged to be marked
through changes in grade, materials, colors or with other formal sidewalk
changes.
   E.   The site should be configured to conceal loading docks, storage, etc.,
from view from the highway and parking lots.
   F.   Shared parking with internal circulation between properties to limit
curb cuts on public streets and limit the need for excessive parking areas is
encouraged.
   G.   Five percent (5%) of every parking lot shall be landscaped in
compliance with the landscape formula.
   H.   Parking lots shall be located no less than twelve feet (12') from any
portion of any building. This twelve foot (12') space may include landscaping
as appropriate.
   I.   Subject to the approval of the zoning officer, alternate landscaping
plans may be substituted for consideration. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-7: DECORATIVE EXTERIOR FLOODLIGHTING:
Decorative exterior floodlighting shall be in accordance with FAA guidelines.
When permitted, all decorative exterior floodlighting shall consist of an
appropriate composition of brightness, textures and colors to dramatize a
setting and extend the hours of the setting's usefulness. Floodlighting
fixtures shall be located and shielded by structure and lenses so as to protect
the public from exposure to the direct light of the fixture and to minimize the
amount of light that is directed to the night sky. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-8: OUTDOOR STORAGE:
All outdoor storage, service areas, refuse removal areas, and loading areas
shall be screened from the view of all public rights of way by a solid board
fence, masonry wall consisting of either brick, "split face" or "rock face"
masonry units or dense evergreen plant materials. All such screening shall be
of a sufficient height to screen storage areas from view. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
11-17C-9: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS:
   A.   Purpose And Intent: The standards of this section are intended to
enhance the appearance of buildings and promote a high quality of design in
order to improve the aesthetic appeal and overall image of the village. The
intent of these standards is to:
      1.   Encourage greater design compatibility with surrounding areas and
establish a precedent for high quality design in areas with no established
character;
      2.   Achieve greater architectural variation and interest through
standards for the design of roofs, exterior walls and the use of exterior
finish materials;
      3.   Encourage greater architectural cohesiveness and compatibility
within a new development of multiple buildings; and
      4.   Reduce the negative visual impact of features and site improvements
such as mechanical equipment. These standards are intended to be applied
together with other development standards as set forth in this title.
   B.   General Application:
      1.   New Construction: These standards shall apply to new construction of
buildings and structures as specified in the following subsections.
      2.   Improvements To Existing Structures And Development Sites:
         a.   These standards shall apply to existing buildings only when a
building expansion or a series of expansions exceeds twenty five percent (25%)
of the existing floor area measured on a cumulative basis starting from the
effective date hereof.
         b.   It is intended that a building expansion subject to these
standards be reasonably integrated with the existing structure or site
condition consistent with these standards.
         c.   These standards shall not be construed to necessitate
improvements to existing buildings or site conditions beyond those necessary to
integrate the proposed improvement with existing conditions in a manner
consistent with these standards.
      3.   Development Or Permit Applications: These standards shall not apply
to any complete development, zoning or building permit application submitted or
approved prior to the effective date hereof.
      4.   Exemption For Historic Buildings: These standards shall not apply to
designated historic structures certified by the state historic preservation
office.
   C.   Compliance:
      1.   Compliance standards set forth in this article are mandatory, unless
the design review committee grants alternative compliance in accordance with
the following provisions. The design review committee may allow application of
an alternative standard, provided the design review committee determines that
the applicant has demonstrated that either:
         a.   Site specific, physical constraints necessitate application of
the alternative standard, and such constraints will not allow a reasonable use
of the property without application of such alternative standard; or
         b.   The alternative standard achieves the intent of the subject
standard to the same or greater degree than the subject standard, and results
in equivalent or greater benefits to the community as would compliance with the
subject standard.
      2.   Whenever the design review committee grants alternative compliance,
the design review committee shall formulate a written statement of findings
based on the above criteria for such action. Such statement shall be filed in
the development application file.
      3.   Decisions by the design review committee with respect to such
alternative compliance may be appealed to the zoning board of appeals.
   D.   Commercial (Nonindustrial) Architectural Standards:
      1.   Application:
         a.   The standards of this subsection apply to retail, office,
institutional and other commercial buildings located in business zoned or
designated areas. In the case of business or commercially designated areas
within a planned unit development, or such uses subject to special review
standards negotiated as part of a planned unit development, or as may be
required by the findings of the special review, may be different or more
stringent than those set forth in this subsection. These standards shall not
apply to buildings located in industrially zoned or designated areas.
         b.   It is intended that these standards apply to the primary facade
of the building and that all sides of the building, where visible from public
rights of way and private roads or service drives or adjacent residential
neighborhoods, shall include design characteristics and materials consistent
with those of the primary facade, except as provided in subsection D2 of this
section. Also, standards specified in subsection E of this section shall be
limited to the facade and walls as specified in said subsection E. (Ord. 1429,
6-4-2007)
      2.   Exceptions: The design review committee may waive the application of
the standards set forth in this article in cases where the visibility of side
or rear walls of the building is substantially diminished by landscaping, or by
a decorative screening wall or earthen berm combined with landscaping, located
between the building wall and any such right of way or adjacent property.
Landscape screening shall be designed to be at least sixty percent (60%) opaque
to a height of six feet (6') upon installation and a minimum of eighty percent
(80%) opaque to a height of six feet (6') within five (5) years of planting.
Such landscaping shall consist of primarily evergreen plant material to provide
year round screening. The required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy
condition by the current owner. In the event any required landscaping material
dies or is destroyed, it shall be replaced by the owner within six (6) months.
Replacement material shall conform to the original intent of the landscape
plan. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007; amd. 2011 Code)
      3.   Design Compatibility:
         a.   Building design shall contribute to the special or unique
characteristics of an area and/or development through the use of predominant
building massing and scale, building materials, architectural elements and
color palette.
         b.   Design compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as
the repetition of rooflines, the use of similar proportions in building mass
and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and
door patterns, and/or the use of building materials that have color shades and
texture similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed
development.
         c.   Where there is no established or consistent neighborhood or area
character of a unifying theme, or where it is not desirable to continue the
existing character because it does not reflect a design theme consistent with
the architectural standards as described in this article, the proposed
development shall be designed to establish an attractive image and set a
standard of quality for future developments and buildings within the area.
Greater attention to design with respect to design compatibility standards in
this subsection D3c shall be required in areas of high visibility such as
community entryways and arterial and major collector roadways including Rock
Island-Milan Parkway, 1st Avenue/Airport Road, 10th Avenue East/Indian Bluff
Road, Knoxville Road and U.S. 67/1st Street. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
      4.   Articulation Of Walls: Facades, and any wall of the building facing
any road or public or private service drive, greater than one hundred feet
(100') in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane
projections or recesses having a depth of at least four percent (4%) of the
length of the facade, extending at least twenty percent (20%) of the length of
the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one hundred
(100) horizontal feet. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007; amd. 2011 Code)
      5.   Delivery/Loading Doors And Docks: No delivery, loading, dock or
trash removal door or facility shall be located on the main street facing the
facade of the building. Any such door or facility shall be located on the side
or rear wall of the building. For sites that have road frontage on multiple
sides, these facilities shall be located in the least obtrusive manner,
preferably on a nonroad facing side of the building, or the road frontage that
has the least public visibility. (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
      6.   Rooftop Mechanical Units: Rooftop mechanical units and other
miscellaneous rooftop equipment shall be substantially screened from view from
public rights of way and other public places. Screening materials shall be of
the same or comparable material, texture and color as the materials used on the
building. Roof mounted equipment screening shall be constructed as an
encompassing monolithic unit rather than several individual screens (i.e.,
multiple equipment screens, or "hats", surrounding individual elements shall
not be permitted). The height of the screening element shall equal or exceed
the height of the structure's tallest piece of installed equipment. (Ord. 1429,
6-4-2007; amd. 2011 Code)
      7.   Building Colors: Colors shall be used to blend buildings into an
area and to unify elements of a development. Color should be drawn from the
surrounding area and, if in a new development area, shall be selected to
establish an attractive image and set a standard of quality for future
developments and buildings within the area. Monotonous or monochromatic color
palettes are strongly discouraged. Accent colors used to call attention to a
particular feature or portion of a building, or to form a particular pattern,
shall be compatible with predominant building base colors and may be
incorporated using such elements as shutters, window mullions, building trim
and awnings. Accent colors shall cover no more than five percent (5%) of a
building facade.
      8.   Illumination: Illumination highlighting the entire facade of a
building, or a significant portion of the building, or backlighted translucent
awnings intended to function as signage, shall not be permitted as part of a
building design. This standard is not intended to preclude the use of lighting
(including neon lighting) to accent limited portions of the building facade.
      9.   Cart Storage And Vending Machines: Cart storage areas, vending
machines, and video and book return containers shall be placed inside the
principal building, placed in an accessory structure designed to complement the
principal building, or screened with walls and landscaping.
      10.   Multi-Building Developments: Developments with multiple buildings
shall include predominant characteristics in each building so that the
buildings within the development appear to be part of a cohesive, planned area,
yet are not monotonous in design. Predominant characteristics may include use
of the same or similar architectural style, materials and colors.
      11.   Building Entrances: Primary public entrances shall be clearly
defined and recessed and projected or framed by elements such as awnings,
arcades, porticoes or other architectural features.
      12.   Franchise Architecture: Prototypical or franchise architectural
designs may be required to be modified to meet these architectural standards.
Changes to prototypical franchise styles to meet these standards may include,
but not be limited to, modifications to roofs, windows, doors, building mass,
materials, colors, placement of architectural features and details, etc. Care
should be taken to ensure that such modifications comply with subsection D3,
"Design Compatibility", of this section. Franchise architectural styles found
to meet these standards will not require any modification.
      13.   Metal Siding: Metal siding may be used as an exterior finish
material as long as the amount used does not exceed twenty five percent (25%)
of the area of any single wall, exclusive of the roof, and provided it matches
or complements the building color and/or material scheme. Further, such metal
siding shall be a "standing seam" type or equivalent quality, not a
"corrugated" type. Architectural metals, such as bronze, brass, copper and
wrought iron, may be used and may exceed the twenty five percent (25%) area
limit.
      14.   Building Design Elements: All buildings shall be designed and
maintained using the following elements, with a minimum of one item each
selected from four (4) of the five (5) groups below: (Ord. 1429, 6-4-2007)
         a.   Group 1 - Exterior Wall Articulation:

   E.   Industrial Architectural Standards:
      1.   Purpose And Intent: These standards are intended to apply to
industrial buildings on sites adjacent to major roads within the highway
corridor overlay district (HCOD) because of the visibility of such development
and its impact on the image and character of the community. Industrial
development that is not adjacent to collector or local roads is not subject to
these standards.
      2.   Application: Standards in this subsection apply to industrial
buildings located in industrial districts and are within planned unit
developments designated for industrial use that are located on sites adjacent
to a major or minor arterial road, as defined by the appropriate jurisdiction
and within the HCOD.
         a.   Sites adjacent to public or private service roads, where there is
no developed or developable private land between the service road and the
arterial road, shall be considered adjacent to such arterial roads or
interstate highways and shall be subject to these standards. This shall include
sites on service roads separated from the arterial or interstate road by public
or private commuter facilities or other public facilities within the right of
way.
         b.   In the case of industrial designated areas within a planned unit
development, or industrial uses subject to special use review, standards
negotiated as part of a planned unit development, or as may be required by the
findings of the special review, may be different or more stringent than those
set forth in this subsection.
         c.   Subsection B, "General Application", of this section, which
addresses how standards apply to new construction and existing buildings, and
subsection C, "Compliance", of this section, also shall apply to standards in
this subsection.
      3.   Design Compatibility:
         a.   Building design shall contribute to the special or unique
characteristics of an area and/or development through the use of predominant
building massing and scale, building materials, architectural elements and
color palette.
         b.   Design compatibility shall be achieved through techniques such as
the repetition of rooflines, the use of similar proportions in building mass
and outdoor spaces, similar relationships to the street, similar window and
door patterns, and/or the use of building materials that have color shades and
textures similar to those existing in the immediate area of the proposed
development.

11-18-9: ESTABLISHMENT OF OFF STREET PARKING BY VILLAGE:
   A.   The planning commission, in consultation with other village departments

shall report its recommendation for the acquisition of such off street parking
facilities to the village board. This report shall include recommendations on
the type, size, location and other pertinent features of the proposed off
street parking facilities and the areas they are intended to serve.

established by means of a special assessment district, or other district which
the village board may have determined, they shall be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter for privately supplied off street parking
facilities except as follows: The village board, upon recommendation of the

exceptional amount of off street parking facilities. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004;
amd. 2011 Code)
      2.   In such cases where alteration, extension or change in a use of a
building, after the levying of the special assessment in such an area or
establishment of the public off street parking facility, creates a need for off
street parking facilities more than thirty percent (30%) in excess of the
requirements of off street parking facilities for such building or use before
alterations, extensions or changes in use, as computed on the basis of the
requirements in this chapter.
      3.   In any district, spaces for off street parking and for loading or
unloading shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

function for which it is intended or can be made so at a cost not exceeding the
value of the equipment in its existing state. In no case shall any such
equipment be so stored for a period of more than six (6) months if not in
condition for safe and efficient performance of the function for which it is
intended. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

11-21-4: Compliance With Provisions
11-21-5: Point Of Measurements
11-21-6: Modifications
11-21-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish lighting requirements for personal
safety and crime prevention while regulating any spillover of light and glare
on operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and land uses near a light source
to promote personal and traffic safety and to prevent the creation of public
nuisances. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-21-2: LIGHTING PLAN:
Except for single-family and two-family dwellings, plans for required parking
lot and security lighting shall be approved by the zoning officer prior to
approval and issuance of permits. Plans, at appropriate scale, shall be based
on accurate, approved final site plans and shall depict all exterior lighting
as to its location, orientation and configuration. This must include, but not
be limited to:
   A.   Luminaire height;
   B.   Luminaire and standard technical specifications;
   C.   Intensity of illumination measured at the least point of illumination
and the greatest point of illumination when measured from ground level;
   D.   Type of light source (metal halide, high pressure sodium, etc.);
   E.   Hours of illumination; and
   F.   Photometric plan superimposed on the site plan for each classification
of lighting with points no greater than thirty feet (30') apart. (Ord. 1301, 3-
15-2004)
11-21-3: ILLUMINATION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
   A.   Lighting Standards In All Districts Except Those Containing Single-
Family And Two-Family Dwellings:
      1.   Wall or roof lighting may be used to illuminate the pedestrian
walkways, entrance areas, and yard areas within thirty feet (30') of the
building. No wall or roof lighting shall be used to illuminate areas for motor
vehicle parking or access unless the zoning officer finds the following:
         a.   That the proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated
purpose in this chapter;
         b.   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         c.   The proposed luminaire has a cutoff angle of less than or equal
to sixty six degrees (66°).
      2.   Any open area used for motor vehicle parking, storage, or access
shall be illuminated with freestanding luminaries. Freestanding luminaries are
permitted to be a maximum of thirty feet (30') in height with a three foot (3')
support, for a maximum height from the ground of thirty three feet (33'). When
a luminaire is located within five hundred feet (500') of a protected
residential property, the maximum permitted luminaire height shall be twenty
five feet (25'). All measurements shall be taken from the average elevation of
the finished grade within ten feet (10') of the structure or fixture to the
highest point of the luminaire. All luminaries must have a total cutoff angle
equal to or less than ninety degrees (90°). The use of exterior lighting with a
cutoff angle greater than ninety degrees (90°) shall be permitted only when the
zoning officer finds the following:
         a.   That the lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose in
this chapter;
         b.   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         c.   The proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of vision
creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      3.   In no instance shall low pressure sodium fixtures be used to
illuminate unprotected residential property unless the zoning officer finds the
following:
         a.   That the proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated
purpose in this chapter;
         b.   That the proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         c.   The color distortion effect of low pressure sodium lighting will
not create a hindrance to crime prevention and investigation.
   B.   Intensity Of Lighting In All Districts Except Those Containing Single-
Family And Two-Family Dwellings:
      1.   The amount of illumination attributable to exterior lighting from a
property shall not exceed one foot-candle when measured at any boundary line
with an adjoining property. This provision may be waived by the issuing
authority when:
         a.   The proposed lighting is not in conflict with the stated purpose
of this chapter;
         b.   The proposed lighting will not unreasonably harm or restrict
public health, safety, and welfare or create a nuisance; and
         c.   The proposed lighting will not result in an impairment of vision
creating a hazard for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      2.   All parking lot and parking structure lighting located within three
hundred feet (300') of a protected residential property line may be illuminated
not more than one hour before the start of business and shall be extinguished
within one hour after the end of business, except as approved by the zoning
officer after finding the following:
         a.   The property has been identified as an area where the incidence
or potential for crime warrants additional lighting;
         b.   Additional lighting is required to increase visibility of a
property which is not readily accessible for police during routine patrol; and
         c.   The use of timers, sensors, or other devices that produce a
reduced lighting level that does not conflict with the stated purpose in this
chapter.
   C.   Glare/Illumination: In all zoning districts, any lighting shall be
arranged to reflect the light away from adjoining property. A person shall not
conduct a use that has a source of illumination that produces glare clearly
visible beyond a property line or creates a sensation of brightness within a
visual field so as to cause annoyance, discomfort, or impairment of vision.
Lenses, deflectors, shields, louvers, or prismatic control devices shall be
used to eliminate nuisance and hazardous lighting to facilitate compliance with
this requirement.
   D.   Parking Structures: Luminaries used for illumination of designated
pedestrian walkways in parking structures shall be of a significantly different
color value than luminaries used for illuminating vehicle parking and drive
aisles. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-21-4: COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
Any new lighting installed after the effective date hereof shall be in
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Any lighting in existence
before the effective date hereof that does not comply with its requirements
shall be considered legally noncomplying and may remain, subject to the
following provisions:
   A.   Alterations To Existing Lighting:
      1.   When poles and support structures are removed and replaced for
reasons other than acts of God or accidents, they must be replaced with
luminaries, poles and supports that comply with this chapter; and
      2.   When luminaries are replaced, they must be replaced with luminaries
that comply with all provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Removal And Replacement Of Parking Lot Surface: When less than fifty
percent (50%) of the gross area of the parking lot surface on a particular site
is removed and replaced, only the parking area replaced must be provided with
lighting in compliance with this chapter. If greater than fifty percent (50%)
of the parking area on a particular site is removed and replaced at one time,
the entire parking lot on the site where the construction activity occurs must
be in full compliance with this chapter. A parking lot or portion thereof is
"removed and replaced" when any portion of the existing parking surface
material is removed and a new surface is installed.
   C.   New Parking Lots Or Parking Lot Additions: When a new parking lot or
addition to an existing parking lot is constructed, the new lot or lot addition
must be provided with lighting in compliance with this chapter.
   D.   New Structures, Additions Or Replacements: When a site is improved with
new structures, or additions to or replacements of existing structures, the
lighting for the new structure, addition or replacement on the site must be
upgraded with compliant lighting. The parking lot lighting must be upgraded
with compliant lighting over a portion of the parking area that is equivalent
to the amount of parking that would be required for the new structure, addition
or replacement. In the event that the new structure, addition or replacement is
accompanied by new or replaced parking area, the amount of upgraded lighting
area shall be that required under this chapter.
   E.   Change Of Type Of Occupancy: When the type of occupancy of a site is
changed, the lighting for the site shall be upgraded to comply with this
chapter for the structure and the parking lot shall be upgraded for the
required parking for the occupancy as established in this title. For the
purpose of determining the type of occupancy of a site, the occupancy
classifications of this code shall be utilized.
   F.   Unoccupied Sites: When a site has been unoccupied for a period of one
year, the lighting shall be upgraded to fully comply with this chapter prior to
any reoccupation of the site.
   G.   Development Application: When a development application is made for a
site, the village board may, as a condition of approval, require compliance
with any or all of the performance standards of this chapter, and the extent of
compliance required in such cases may be greater than that otherwise required
in this chapter, if deemed reasonably necessary to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare and to achieve the proposes of this chapter. (Ord. 1301, 3-
15-2004)
11-21-5: POINT OF MEASUREMENTS:
Any light intensity measurement taken at the property line shall be measured at
the greatest point of illumination of said property line. Any measurements to
determine the minimum and maximum lighting levels internal to a site will be
measured by positioning the meter horizontally at ground level at the greatest
and least points of artificial illumination. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)
11-21-6: MODIFICATIONS:
Modifications to the requirements of this chapter may be approved as part of a
final development plan for a planned development overlay district pursuant to
the provisions; provided, that:
   A.   Any deviations from lighting standards established by this chapter are
clearly delineated in the plan submission reviewed by the planning commission
and approved by the village board;
   B.   Any deviations are consistent with the purposes of this chapter;
   C.   The minimum light level proposed provides a minimum of seventy five
percent (75%) of the illumination required in this chapter;
   D.   The height of support poles above grade does not exceed the maximum
permitted by this chapter by more than twenty five percent (25%); except, that
no development shall be allowed for increased support pole height within five
hundred feet (500') of a protected residential property; and
   E.   No increase in glare occurs as a result of deviation from the adopted
standards. (Ord. 1301, 3-15-2004)

assistance of the village attorney, may:
      1.   Require the surety to perform on the bond, and to pay to the village
an amount equal to the cost of completing the required improvements (as
estimated by the appropriate village official) or the amount of the bond not
theretofore released, whichever is less; or
      2.   Order the escrow agent to retain all escrowed funds needed to
complete the required improvements, and to return the balance (if any) of such
funds to the subdivider/developer. (Ord. 1334, 4-18-2005)

jurisdiction of the village until said final plat has been approved by the
village board. The village board shall not approve any final plat unless they
determine that it is in compliance with all pertinent requirements of this
title including those set forth in this section.
   B.   Filing, Time Limit: The subdivider of every subdivision who desires
final plat approval shall file six (6) black or blue line prints of the final
plat and supporting data with the appropriate village official not later than
one year after preliminary plat approval has been granted.

inch (1" = 100'); provided, that the resultant drawing shall not be less than
eight and one half inches by fourteen inches (81/2" x 14") and shall not exceed
twenty four inches by thirty six inches (24" x 36"). Submission of final plats
in digital format will be used by the county for direct importation into the
countywide geographic information system (GIS). To import digital files, GPS
(global positioning system) points will be collected on four (4) monuments, as
established by the surveyor. Accuracy of GPS points will be acceptable when
obtained to submeter accuracy and will be used for the express purpose of file
transportation into the GIS. GPS points will be for internal use only in the
development and maintenance of the countywide GIS and not for use by the
general public nor for future survey work.
      2.   GPS points, when collected by the surveyor to the above referenced
standards, may be delivered to the county under separate digital file, and such
information will not be required as part of plat submission. If the county
collects GPS points, the fee for such collection will be twenty dollars
($20.00) per point ($80.00 per plat). The fee shall be paid as described
hereinbefore.

miles per hour), R shall equal five hundred feet (500');
      2.   For local streets (design speed equals 30 miles per hour), R shall
equal one hundred twenty five feet (125'); and
      3.   For alleys, R shall equal one hundred feet (100').
   C.   Through Traffic Discouraged: Marginal access and local streets shall be
laid out so as to discourage use by through traffic. The rigid rectangular
gridiron street pattern should be avoided, and the use of curvilinear streets,
cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets shall be encouraged to effect a more desirable
street layout.
   D.   Limited Access To Arterials: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed arterial street, the planning commission may recommend to
the village board that access to said arterial may be limited by one of the
following means:
      1.   The subdivision of lots so that they back onto the arterial street
and front onto a parallel local street (double frontage lots), coupled with the
installation of screening in a reserve (access restricting) strip along the
rear lot lines of such lots;
      2.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and generally at right angles to the arterial street; or
      3.   A frontage road separated from the arterial street by a planting
strip, but having access thereto at suitable points.
   E.   Dead End Streets:
      1.   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged to provide for
the continuation of streets between adjacent properties when such continuation
is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire and police
protection, and efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation
comports with the village comprehensive plan. If the adjacent property is owned
by the developer (under the same ownership) and undeveloped and the street must
dead end temporarily, the right of way shall be extended to the property line,
and no strip that would prevent connections with future streets shall be
reserved. A temporary turnaround shall be provided at the terminus of any
temporary dead end street. If the adjacent property is under another ownership,
there should be a permanent dead end.
      2.   Permanent Dead End Streets: Cul-de-sacs shall have a maximum length
of seven hundred fifty feet (750'). A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum
right of way diameter of ninety eight feet (98'), a minimum pavement return
radius of twenty five feet (25'), and a pavement diameter of seventy five feet
(75'), shall be provided at the end of every permanent dead end street.
   F.   Alleys: Alleys shall be prohibited in single-family residence
districts. Alleys may be required in multiple-family districts and in
commercial/industrial districts unless other adequate provisions for service
access are made. Adequate vehicular turnaround space shall be provided at the
terminus of any dead end alley.
   G.   Intersections:
      1.   Two Streets Only: Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at
any one point.
      2.   Right Angles: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly
as possible at right angles. In no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an
angle of less than eighty degrees (80°) or more than one hundred degrees
(100°). An oblique street shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall
be approximately at right angles with said intersection for at least one
hundred feet (100') therefrom.
      3.   Alignment: Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing
street shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on
the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less
than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall not be permitted, except where
the intersected street has divided lanes without median breaks at either
intersection. Intersections involving collector or arterial streets shall be at
least eight hundred feet (800') apart.
      4.   Curb Radii: To permit safe vehicular movement at corners, the
minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) streets shall be fifteen
feet (15') where both streets are marginal access or local, and at other
intersections, not less than twenty five feet (25').
      5.   Grade: Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade of one-
half of one percent (0.5%). In hilly terrain, an area having not greater than a
two percent (2%) slope for a distance of sixty feet (60') from the nearest
right of way line of the intersecting street shall be provided at the approach
to an intersection.
      6.   Cross Slope: The cross slopes of all streets, including
intersections, shall not exceed three percent (3%).
      7.   Adequate Sightlines:
         a.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right of way to
the extent necessary to provide adequate sight distance in accordance with the
following:
 
30 miles per hour 130 feet each way from intersection
35 miles per hour 155 feet each way from intersection
 
         b.   For design speeds exceeding thirty five (35) miles per hour,
sight distance will be determined based upon AASHTO criteria.
   H.   Reverse Curves: A tangent at least fifty feet (50') long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on local streets and one hundred feet (100')
long on collector streets.
   I.   Road Dedications And Reservations And Improvements To Existing Streets:
      1.   New Perimeter Streets: Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half streets. Where an
existing half street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The planning
commission may authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves
and dedicates the entire required street right of way width within his own
subdivision boundaries.
      2.   Existing Roads: Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road
or when the comprehensive plan, official map, or zoning setback regulations
indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that would require use of
some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall be required to improve
and dedicate, at his expense, such areas for widening or realignment of such
roads as are specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision and to
reserve for public use any portion of the right of way determined not to be
specifically and uniquely attributable to his subdivision.
      3.   Excess Right Of Way: Right of way in excess of the standards set
forth in the table of street design specifications shall be required to be
dedicated when:
         a.   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate earth slopes; or
         b.   Due to the location of railroad tracks, additional width is
needed to construct overpasses, underpasses, and approaches thereto.
      4.   Definition: For purposes of this subsection, the phrase
"specifically and uniquely attributable" shall mean, as a minimum, that areas
currently zoned or to be zoned single- family for residential uses in the
comprehensive plan shall require marginal access, local, or collector streets,
depending on density; that areas currently zoned or to be zoned for multi-
family residential uses in the comprehensive plan shall require local,
boulevard, collector, minor arterial, or principal arterial streets, depending
on density; that areas currently zoned or to be zoned for commercial uses in
the comprehensive plan shall require local, collector, minor arterial, or
principal arterial streets, depending on whether same is a neighborhood,
community, or regional area; and that areas currently zoned or to be zoned for
industrial uses in the comprehensive plan shall require collector, minor
arterial, or principal arterial streets, depending on the size of the
industrial area. (Ord. 1334, 4-18-2005)

12-4-11: SANITARY SEWER FACILITIES:
   A.   Compliance Required: All proposed sanitary sewer facilities shall
comply with the regulations of the Illinois environmental protection agency,
and must be approved by the appropriate village official.
   B.   Public System Available:
      1.   Whenever the subdivision, any point of which is within three hundred
feet (300') of an existing publicly owned sewer main or other collection
system, and the subdivider has the right to extend public sewer mains or
private sewer laterals from said property to said existing publicly owned sewer
main or other collection system either by way of street, alley, public way,

12-4-15: DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC USE:
   A.   The village board may require the developer to dedicate (i.e., to
transfer without compensation) to the village or other appropriate governmental
entity suitable parcel(s) of land within the subdivision for public purposes,
provided such facilities are otherwise required by this title. Any such
dedicated area shall be shown on the final plat.
   B.   Besides requiring the developer to dedicate parcels for public
purposes, the village board may require that he reserve land for parks,
playgrounds, schools, or other public purposes in locations designated in the
village comprehensive plan. Since public acquisition of reserved land requires
compensation, it is not essential that the need for such land be uniquely and
specifically attributable to the subdivision 1 . (Ord. 1334, 4-18-2005)
 
Notes

12-4-16: OFFICIAL MAP:
   A.   Adoption: There is hereby adopted an official map which shall be
applicable to all land situated within the village, and shall also be
applicable to contiguous territory within one and one-half (11/2) miles from
the corporate limits of the village and not included within the corporate
limits of any other municipality. The official map shall be filed in the office
of the village clerk and is made part of this chapter by reference.
   B.   Public Improvements Shown On Map: The official map may show indication
of sites for planned public facilities. Public facility sites which may be
indicated on the official map may include, but are not limited to: sites for
new trafficways or widening of existing trafficways; school sites; recreational
sites; public building sites; and sites for future storm drainage, electrical
or other public service or utility easements.
   C.   Availability Of Sites For Improvements:
      1.   Whenever the official map indicates the necessity for providing a
site for a planned public facility, the board of trustees may require that the
site for the public use be designated on the subdivision plat before granting
approval to such plat; and, furthermore, that the site be held for that
specific public use for a period of one year from the date of approval of the
final plat. When such designation has been required, the board of trustees
shall notify the responsible public agency in writing of the designation within
ten (10) days.
      2.   Whenever a site for public use, shown on the official map, has been
required to be indicated on a subdivision plat, the responsible agency having
jurisdiction of such use shall acquire the land so designated by purchase or
commence proceedings to acquire the land by condemnation within one year from
the date of final approval of the plat; and if it does not do so within such
period of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners in
any other manner consistent with this title, the zoning ordinance, or any other
provision of this code or other ordinance of the village.
   D.   Amendments To Map: Amendments to the official map, including the
indication of additional public sites to be shown on the map, shall be
considered amendments to this title and, therefore, shall be as specified in
this title for amendments to this title. Any public agency requesting the
establishment of the official map of a future public site or easement which is
not included in the comprehensive plan shall indicate to the planning
commission the need for the site in the particular location specified. The
village planning commission, before making a favorable recommendation for the
inclusion on the official map of such site by the village board, shall find
that this public site location is determined to be necessary to provide public
service consistent with the village comprehensive plan and shall so indicate in
its minutes. (Ord. 1334, 4-18-2005)

   A.   The village, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is
authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct, operate,
maintain, and reconstruct cable systems within the village.
   B.   The village board finds that cable service has become an integral part
of the lives of its citizens, and that evolving cable systems have the
potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future, providing great
benefits and advanced capabilities to the village. The board further finds that
the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the village or such persons
as the village designates.
   C.   In order to ensure that the village and its residents receive state of
the art cable services and capabilities as this technology further evolves, all
franchises granted pursuant to this title will be subject to periodic review

operators provide the best possible cable service to residents of the village,
and any franchises issued pursuant to this title shall be deemed to include
this finding as an integral part thereof.
   D.   The board further finds stringent customer service standards, including
liquidated damage provisions as provided in the franchise documents, may be the
only practical means of approximating the costs of franchise agreement
noncompliance to the village and its residents. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

franchise or applicable law. In the event of any conflict between the terms and

generally applicable regulatory ordinances of the village, the specific terms

stringent or burdensome requirements or conditions; provided, however, that

system or to provide cable service in the village without a franchise. Any such

day. The payment of such fine notwithstanding, all such violators shall be
subject to all other applicable provisions of this title, including, but not
limited to, the payment of a franchise fee. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001; amd. 2011
Code)
13-2-3: NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE:
Any franchise granted pursuant to this title shall be nonexclusive. The grantor

federal and state law. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

In the event the village grants more than one franchise or similar
authorization for the construction, operation, or maintenance of any cable
system to a qualified person in a franchise area, the village policy shall be
to grant the franchises on terms that are nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the use
of identical terms or conditions or limiting the enforceability of conditions
that are freely negotiated. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

Any franchise shall be valid within the entire franchise area. Unless a
franchise agreement specifically states otherwise, every franchise shall apply
to the entire territorial area of the village. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-6: RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR:
   A.   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
title or a franchise agreement, the grantor reserves to itself every right and
power that is required to be reserved by a provision of any other ordinance or
under any other franchise.
   B.   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of this title
or a franchise agreement, except those required by federal or state regulation,
if the grantor determines: 1) that it is in the public interest to do so; and
2) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on a
grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by
a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the
grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver
of such provision subsequent to such instance, nor be deemed a waiver of any
other provision of this title or a franchise agreement unless the statement in
its final form, approved by the village board, so recites. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-
2001)
13-2-7: FRANCHISE AGREEMENT:

agreement as negotiated between the grantee and the grantor.
   B.   In addition to those matters required elsewhere in this title to be
included in the franchise agreement, each franchise agreement must contain the
following express representations by each grantee:
      1.   The grantee has examined all of the provisions of this title and
agrees that it is valid as of the effective date of the grantee's franchise,
but does not waive its rights to challenge the legality of future amendments to
this title, and also including the right to challenge any future changes in
applicable law that result in constitutionally permissible preemption of the
franchise or this title.
      2.   The grantee recognizes the right of the village to adopt such
additional regulations of general applicability as it shall find necessary in
the exercise of its police power.
   C.   Every franchise agreement shall contain such further conditions or
provisions as may be negotiated between the village and a grantee; except, that
no such conditions or provisions shall be such as to conflict with any
provisions of state or federal law. In case of any conflict or of any ambiguity
between any terms or provisions of a franchise agreement adopted by ordinance,
the provisions of the franchise agreement shall control. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

established by the village shall accompany the application. Such application

deemed to be: a) "payments in kind" or any involuntary payments chargeable
against the compensation to be paid to the village by grantee; or b) part of

franchise, the village administrator shall prepare a report and make his or her
recommendations respecting such application to the village board.

time and date approved by the board. Within thirty (30) days after the close of
the hearing, the board shall make a decision based upon the evidence received
at the hearing as to whether or not the franchise(s) should be granted, and, if
granted, subject to what conditions.
   C.   All applicants for an initial franchise grant shall submit an
application fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to compensate the village
for its costs in reviewing, preparing and awarding a franchise, including the
costs of outside consultants. Upon the grant of a franchise, the village may
request the payment of an additional fee to the extent that the reasonable
costs of the franchise review and negotiation process exceed the initial
application fee amount. Consistent with the cable act, all such fees shall not
constitute or be credited towards a grantee's franchise fee obligations. (Ord.
1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-10: TERM OF FRANCHISE; RENEWALS:
   A.   A franchise agreement shall establish the term of franchise. A
franchise agreement may provide for a term of up to fifteen (15) years.
   B.   Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law
including, but not necessarily limited to, the cable communications policy act
of 1984, as amended. The grantor and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter
into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. (Ord.
1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-11: GRANT OF ADDITIONAL FRANCHISE AND COMPETING SERVICE:
Since competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the
public rights of way, on the quality and availability of services to the
public, and may adversely affect an existing operator's ability to continue to
provide the services and facilities it is presently providing under a
franchise, in granting a franchise in an area where another grantee is
operating, the village may consider the potential impact which the grant of an
additional franchise may have on the community. This determination may be made
simultaneously with the adoption of the grantee's franchise agreement. In
considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the village
shall specifically consider, and address in a written report or in provisions
of the franchise agreement, the following issues:
   A.   The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the
community.
   B.   The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to
provide cable services to the entire franchise area which is served by the
existing cable operator. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that any
competition which may occur among grantees will be on terms which, when taken
as a whole, do not give a competitive advantage to one grantee over another.
   C.   The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction
of the proposed system and activate service in the entire franchise area, and
whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in
a timely manner.
   D.   The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed
commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain, and operate the
proposed cable system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to
ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial
capabilities, the village may request equity and debt financing commitment
letters, current audited financial statements, bonds, letters of credit, or
other documentation to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village that the
requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available.
   E.   The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based
upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of
signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate
such system.
   F.   The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance, and
operation of a cable television system.
   G.   The capacity of the public rights of way to accommodate one or more
additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights of
way and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises
are granted.
   H.   The disruption of existing cable service and the potential that the
proposed franchise would adversely affect the residents of the village.
   I.   The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide
competing cable service to subscribers within the entire franchise area for the
duration of the franchise.
   J.   Such other information as the village may deem appropriate to be
considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. (Ord.
1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-12: NONFRANCHISED ENTITIES:
   A.   The village may issue a license, easement, or other permit to a person
other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the
grantee's franchise area within the village in order to provide service
outside, but not within the village. Such license or easement, absent a grant
of a franchise in accordance with this title, shall not authorize nor permit
said person to provide cable service of any type to any home or place of
business within the village nor render any other service within the village.
   B.   Such license, easement or permit shall require the payment of a fee for
occupancy of the public right of way to the extent permitted by applicable law.
(Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-13: REVIEW FOR COMPETITION:
   A.   The village recognizes that the cable television and telecommunications
industries are in a period of convergence, and that the technologies and
services provided by these industries are rapidly changing, and that the
telecommunications act of 1996 promoted and encouraged competition between and
among these formally discrete industries. At this time, it is premature to know
fully the extent to which there will be changes in law, technology or services
that may impact entities that have been or may be granted franchises or
licenses to use the village rights of way. It is the desire of the village to
be a communications friendly village, that encourages the development of
competitive advanced communications capabilities for the benefit of all its
citizens. For this reason, the regulatory ordinances and franchises of the
village should not impede or restrict the fair opportunity to compete, but
rather are intended to provide uniform and consistent requirements for all
similarly situated providers.
   B.   Consistent with the above findings, the village administrator or
designate is authorized to undertake an evaluation and study of these changing
and emerging technologies and services, as well as legal requirements relating
to them, and upon request by the village, submit a report to the village
regarding the impact of this title and its impact on existing providers within
the village and the development of competition. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-2-14: CABLE INTERNET SERVICES CLASSIFICATION:
In the event that cable internet services are determined by applicable law to
be classified as a service other than a cable service, and applicable law
specifically allows the grantor to collect a fee on such service, the grantee
and grantor shall enter into discussions to determine fees on cable internet
services. Any fee determined by mutual agreement of both parties shall be
consistent with those applied to all other providers of similarly classified
services in the service area so as not to competitively disadvantage the
grantee in the marketing of its services. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
CHAPTER 3
DESIGN PROVISIONS
SECTION:
13-3-1: General Design Provisions
13-3-2: Drops To Public Buildings
13-3-3: Village Use Of Grantee Facilities
13-3-4: Upgrade Of System
13-3-5: Nondiscriminatory Access To System
13-3-1: GENERAL DESIGN PROVISIONS:
   A.   Every grantee shall offer service that meets the current and future
needs of the village. Such service shall, at a minimum, be comparable to
services offered by that grantee or its affiliates operating any headend
serving the village and surrounding municipalities in the Quad City area. The
franchise agreement shall incorporate a description of the grantee's system
including the general design and capabilities of the system to identify for the
village how the system will meet the current and future cable needs of the
village.
   B.   The franchise agreement shall include provisions to provide for a
"periodic review" between the village and a grantee to evaluate changes in law,
technology, or service, and reasonable procedures to allow for mutually good
faith negotiations toward modification of the franchise agreement to
incorporate changes identified as desirable or necessary for the benefit of
both the grantor and grantee as a result of any such periodic review.
   C.   Every system shall pass by every single-family dwelling unit and
multiple-family dwelling unit within the franchise area in accordance with line
extension policies set forth in the applicable franchise agreement. Service
shall be provided to subscribers in accordance with the schedules and line
extension policies specified in the applicable franchise agreement. (Ord. 1241,
6-18-2001)
13-3-2: DROPS TO PUBLIC BUILDINGS:
   A.   Every grantee shall provide installation of at least one cable drop and
one outlet, and provide monthly basic cable service, without charge, to public
buildings as specified by the franchise agreement, irrespective of the distance
of the drop. Specific requirements with respect to such drops shall be included
in individual franchise agreements. Expanded or enhanced basic cable service
shall be provided for up to two (2) designated buildings as specified in the
franchise agreement for the purpose of monitoring of systems.
   B.   All such cable service outlets shall not be utilized for commercial
purposes. The village shall take reasonable precautions to prevent any village
use of the grantee's cable system in any inappropriate manner or that may
result in loss or damage to the system. Users of such outlets shall hold the
grantee harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use
of such outlets, other than for those claims arising out of improper
installation or faulty equipment.
   C.   Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection A of this section, if
any public building, which is more than five hundred feet (500') from the
grantee's cable existing at the time of acquisition or placement in service or
use of said public building, is acquired or placed in service or use by the
grantor after the effective date hereof, then costs to install a drop to said
building shall be split evenly between the grantor and the grantee such that
the grantor pays one- half (1/2) of the costs and the grantee pays one-half (1/
2) of the costs of said installation which exceed the costs of installation
directly related to the first five hundred feet (500') of installation from the
then existing cable. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-3-3: VILLAGE USE OF GRANTEE FACILITIES:
The franchise agreement shall incorporate provisions regarding the village use
of a grantee's poles, ducts and conduits, on mutually agreed upon terms. (Ord.
1241, 6-18-2001)
13-3-4: UPGRADE OF SYSTEM:
Every grantee shall upgrade its system (herein referred to as the "system
upgrade"), if required, as set forth in its respective franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-3-5: NONDISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO SYSTEM:
   A.   The village and its residents have an increasing need and desire for
broadband access to the internet and other online services. In order to protect
competition and provide for the future needs of the village, unless otherwise
required by applicable state or federal law, the grantor reserves any legal
right it now has, or may in the future have, to implement an "open access"
requirement to ensure that a grantee will be required to provide
nondiscriminatory access to its cable system to providers of internet access
service, irrespective of whether such providers are affiliated with the
grantee.
   B.   The grantee may be required, if legally permissible and technically
feasible, to implement "open access" requirements to its cable system to
nonaffiliated internet access service providers if the grantee or its
affiliates or subsidiaries under its control determine to do so in a similar
manner in other cable systems owned and operated by the grantee or its
affiliates or subsidiaries under its control, provided the grantor or
nonaffiliated internet access service providers shall pay all reasonable
expenses of the grantee to make the grantee's cable system capable of offering
"open access".
   C.   The foregoing notwithstanding, it is recognized that "open access" and
the legal authority of local franchise authorities to compel such access is
under review, and the potential impact on subscribers is not yet fully known.
Accordingly, grantees will not be required to provide nondiscriminatory access
to their cable system until further review by the grantor and pending
clarification of the village legal authority as well as an evaluation by the
village of the merits and policy considerations related to this issue. By
adopting this title, neither the village nor any grantee has waived any rights,
obligations, claims, defenses or remedies regarding the village authority to
impose such conditions. Prior to the enactment of any such requirement, a
grantee will be provided with reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard,
including the right to present evidence on any findings to be made by the
village with respect to the need for such a requirement. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
CHAPTER 4
INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK AND PEG ACCESS
SECTION:
13-4-1: Institutional Network Required
13-4-2: PEG Access Channels Required
13-4-3: Proof Of Performance Testing
13-4-1: INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK REQUIRED:
Every grantee shall, consistent with applicable law and enforceable commitments
of a grantee, to the extent provided in its franchise agreement, make available
capacity from its network or dedicated fibers, or provide other support for an
institutional network for governmental and educational use. To the extent that
a grantee is obligated to provide such support pursuant to its franchise
agreement, such obligation will be implemented in a competitively neutral
manner, on a per subscriber basis with respect to any other franchises granted
after the effective date hereof. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-4-2: PEG ACCESS CHANNELS REQUIRED:
Every grantee shall provide a channel or channels, bandwidth capacity, service,
and capital funding for separate public, educational and government access
channels as specified in its franchise agreement. All such PEG access channels
shall be available to all subscribers as part of their basic cable service.
Every grantee shall make a good faith effort to negotiate with other cable
providers in the village and the surrounding area to interconnect its network
where feasible in order to facilitate any requirements with respect to shared
access programming on a local and regional basis. The village reserves the
right to negotiate franchise agreement provisions with respect to the uniform
cablecasting of PEG access programming throughout the entire village without
respect to the specific cable operator. Oversight and administration of the PEG
access channels shall be as set forth in the franchise agreement. The village
reserves the right to designate a community access corporation or similar
entity to administer one or more of the access channels; and upon said
designation, the grantee shall assist and cooperate to transfer administration
to said corporation as provided in the franchise agreement; provided, however,
that the costs of said assistance, cooperation and transfer shall at all times
be borne by the grantee. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-4-3: PROOF OF PERFORMANCE TESTING:
To ensure high quality service throughout the system, proof of performance
testing will be performed to the extent required by FCC rules and will be made
available to the village upon written request throughout the term of a
franchise agreement. Every grantee will monitor access channels throughout the
system as required by FCC rules to determine that the level of technical
quality of access channels is in conformance with FCC rules and to ensure that
the level of technical quality on such channels is the same as on other
channels. A log of such monitoring shall be maintained by the grantee, for
inspection by the village. In the event that a complaint is made by a
programmer of any PEG access channels, the grantee shall immediately
investigate the complaint and determine whether the grantee is in compliance
with the technical standards set forth in section
13-5-2 of this title. The procedures set forth in section
13-5-3 of this title shall apply with respect to technical testing of access
channels. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

resolution. Such written records shall be on file in written or electronic form
at the office of each grantee. Every grantee shall make available to the
grantor a written summary of such complaints and their resolutions upon
request. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-5-11: PARENTAL CONTROL:
Every grantee shall make available to any subscriber upon request a "lockout"
device for blocking both video and audio portions of any channel(s) of
programming entering the subscriber's premises. Such device shall be provided
at a reasonable charge, except to the extent that federal law specifically
provides otherwise. The grantee may, however, require a reasonable security
deposit for the use of such a device. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-5-12: PERIODIC SUBSCRIBER SURVEY:
The franchise agreement shall provide terms for a periodic subscriber survey to
assess the cable related needs of the community throughout the term of the
franchise as well as procedures for review and implementation of changes

13-5-13: SERVICE AREA:
No grantee may discriminate in the build out of its system to a particular area
of the village or provision of service to individual or groups of residents on
the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or age.
Unless the franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall serve
all areas of the village with populations of at least thirty five (35) dwelling
units per cable mile, including areas annexed subsequent to the grant of the
franchise. The franchise agreement shall provide a schedule of the areas to be
served and the specific build out requirements of the grantee. Unless the
franchise agreement provides otherwise, every grantee shall extend its system
into any areas not specifically covered in its build out plan if any of the
following conditions are met: (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001; amd. 2011 Code)
   A.   Mandatory Extension Rule: The grantee shall extend the system and make
service available at regular installation and regular monthly charges upon
request to any contiguous area not designated for initial service in the plan
when potential subscribers can be served by extension of the system past
occupied dwelling units equivalent to thirty five (35) units or more per street
mile. Such extension shall be at the grantee's cost and shall commence no later
than the conclusion of the following calendar year. If aerial extension is
allowed by regulation but underground installation is requested by benefited
subscribers, the cost of undergrounding that exceeds estimated aerial extension
cost may be charged to benefited subscribers. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
   B.   Line Extension:
      1.   The grantee shall also extend the system and make service available
at regular monthly rates to any contiguous area where the average density of
occupied dwelling units passed by the extension is the equivalent of more than
thirty five (35) dwelling units per street mile upon receipt of payment, by
each occupied dwelling unit requesting service in such area, of a special
installation charge determined by the following formula: (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001;
amd. 2011 Code)
 
Cost       -    Cost       = Special installation charge per subscriber
Subscriber  35 x Penetration  
 
 
Where:        
              Capital cost to construct the extension of plant including each
Cost        = house drop requested but excluding the cost of converters or
              other necessary subscriber terminal devices.
Subscribers = Number of occupied dwelling units requesting cable service in the
              area and paying calculated special installation charge.
Penetration = The total number of subscribers to the cable system divided by
              the number of occupied dwelling units passed by the cable system.
 
      2.   Following the activation of the extension, any new subscriber along
the extension shall pay the grantee the special installation charge determined
above. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
      3.   On the anniversary date of the first and second year following the
activation of any extension, the grantee shall recalculate the special
installation charge in accordance with subsection B1 of this section. If the
new calculated special installation charge is less than the net special
installation charge paid by any subscribers, the grantee shall refund each such
subscriber the net amount paid in excess of the most recently calculated
special installation charge. After the recalculation of the special
installation charge on the second anniversary and the payment of any associated
refund to subscribers, no further recalculation of the special installation
charge shall be made and no further refunds shall be required; except, that in
the event the number of occupied dwelling units passed by the extension becomes
equivalent to a density of thirty five (35) units or more per street mile, each
subscriber served by the extension shall receive a refund from the grantee of
the net special installation charge paid less the grantee's regular
installation charge. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001; amd. 2011 Code)
   C.   Newly Annexed Areas: In such cases where mandatory extension of the
cable system is required for areas newly annexed after the date of the
franchise agreement, but the technical capabilities of the then existing cable
system are such that the minimum technical performance standards required by
this chapter, the franchise agreement and the FCC cannot be met, then the
grantee shall be required to make such extension only if the grantee can earn a
fair return (as measured by the grantee's weighted average cost of capital) on
the incremental investment required, combined with the overall investment base
of the cable system within the boundaries of the franchise area.

village shall not, however, pay the costs for underground facility placement or
otherwise grant incentives to electric and telephone utilities for underground
facility placement without providing the same terms or incentives to the

use the rights of way of the village for the construction, operation and
maintenance of a cable system within the village, and to defray the costs of
regulation, each grantee shall pay to the grantor an annual amount equal to
five percent (5%) of the grantee's gross revenues.
   B.   Payments due the grantor under this section shall be computed quarterly
for the preceding quarter. Each quarter payment shall be due and payable no

the franchise agreement provides otherwise, at the request of the village, the
grantee shall electronically deposit payments into a financial institution
designated by the village. Any associated charges for electronic transfer may
be credited against the franchise fee. Verification of this deposit shall be
provided to the village treasurer. Each payment shall be accompanied by a brief
report by a grantee showing the basis for the computation and a "franchise fee
worksheet" listing all of the sources of revenues attributable to the operation
of the grantee's system. A grantee that is subject to a municipal
telecommunications consent fee shall maintain separate accounts and records
with respect to the calculation and payment of such fees.
   C.   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment
be construed as a release of any claim the grantor may have for further sums
payable under the provisions of this title or a franchise agreement. All
amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the grantor or its
designee at any time during any calendar year (but no more than once per
calendar year) upon twenty (20) calendar days' notice, including information on
the specific documents requested to be reviewed. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-8-2: SECURITY FUND, BONDS AND INSURANCE:

agreement in an amount and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise
agreement in a mutually agreed upon form as specified in the franchise
agreement.
   B.   Each grantee shall maintain bonds and insurance with the village in
amounts and in a manner as set forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. Each
grantee also shall be required to indemnify the village in a manner as set
forth in the grantee's franchise agreement. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)
13-8-3: PENALTIES PROCEDURE:
   A.   Whenever the grantor has reason to believe that a grantee has violated
any provision of a franchise agreement or this title, the grantor shall first
notify the grantee of the violation and demand correction within a reasonable
time, which shall not be less than twenty (20) days in the case of the failure
of a grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the grantor under a franchise
agreement, and thirty (30) days in all other cases. If a grantee fails to
correct the violation within the time prescribed, or if a grantee is unable to
correct the violation and fails to commence corrective action within the time
prescribed and to diligently remedy such violation thereafter, the grantee
shall then be given written notice of not less than twenty (20) days of a
public hearing to be held before the board. Said notice shall indicate with
reasonable specificity the violation alleged to have occurred.
   B.   At the public hearing, the board shall hear and consider all relevant
evidence and thereafter render findings and a decision based upon the evidence.
Any such hearing must, at a minimum, provide the grantee a full and fair
opportunity to be heard by the village.
   C.   In the event the village finds that a grantee has corrected the
violation or promptly commenced correction of such violation after notice
thereof from the grantor and is diligently proceeding to fully remedy the
violation, or that no violation has occurred, the proceedings shall terminate,
and no penalty or other sanction shall be imposed.
   D.   In the event the village finds that a violation exists and that a
grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner, the village may
impose liquidated damages from the security fund or performance bond as set out
in the franchise agreement.
   E.   If the grantor elects to assess liquidated damages, then such election
shall constitute the grantor's exclusive remedy for a period of sixty (60)
days. Thereafter, if a grantee remains in noncompliance, the grantor may pursue
any other available remedy.
   F.   In the event that a franchise is canceled or terminated by reason of
the default of a grantee, the security fund deposited pursuant to a franchise
agreement shall remain in effect and available to the grantor until all pending
claims or penalties are resolved or settled, after which point, any remaining
amounts in the security fund shall revert to the possession of the grantee.
   G.   The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the security fund
are in addition to all other rights of the grantor, whether reserved by a
franchise agreement, this title, or authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall
affect any other right the grantor may have.
   H.   In instances of repeated violations, whether remedied or not, the
grantor shall serve special notice outlining additional remediation
requirements. Failure to cure, as measured by repeated instances of the same
violation, is evidence of an evasive practice and may lead to revocation under
chapter 9 of this title. (Ord. 1241, 6-18-2001)

   A.   Grantor's Right To Purchase System: The grantor shall be entitled to a
right of first refusal of any bona fide offer to purchase the system made to a
grantee only if such offer includes only the cable system operated in the
village and is not linked in any way to the sale of a cable system in another
community. "Bona fide offer", as used in this subsection, means an offer
received by a grantee that it intends to accept. The village shall have thirty
(30) days to notify the grantee of its intent to purchase the system. Upon
receipt of such notice, the grantee shall have thirty (30) days to provide the
village with all information reasonably necessary for the village to conduct a
due diligence with respect to the purchase of the system. The village must have
readily available funds necessary to pay the full amount of the bona fide offer

prior written consent of the grantor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
denied or delayed and may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the
grantor that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical, or financial
qualifications to consummate the transaction and operate the system so as to
perform its obligations under this title and the applicable franchise

the normal course of business. Consent from the grantor shall not be required

whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a
corporation, partnership, or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with a grantee.

transfer of an interest in or control of a franchise or cable system requiring
compliance with this section: 1) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of all
or a majority of a grantee's assets; 2) the sale, assignment, or other transfer
of capital stock or partnership, membership, or other equity interests in a
grantee by one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members, or
other equity owners so as to create a new controlling interest in a grantee; 3)
the issuance of additional capital stock or partnership membership or other
equity interest by a grantee so as to create a new controlling interest in a
grantee; and 4) a grantee's agreement to transfer management or operation of
the grantee or the system to an unaffiliated entity. The term "controlling
interest", as used herein, means majority equity ownership of a grantee.

control of a franchise or cable system, the village shall have one hundred
twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of such sale or transfer
that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required in
accordance with FCC regulations and the requirements of this title and the
applicable franchise agreement. If the village fails to render a final decision
on the request within the statutory one hundred twenty (120) day time period,
such request shall be deemed granted unless the requesting party and the
village agree to an extension of the one hundred twenty (120) day period.
   D.   The grantor reserves any rights it may have to require that a grantee
pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the grantor in connection
with the sale, assignment, or transfer of a franchise, including, but not
limited to, the grantor's reasonable costs of reviewing the qualifications of
