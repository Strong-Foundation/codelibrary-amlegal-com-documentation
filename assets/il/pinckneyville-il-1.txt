Act took effect and amended the definition of a âmeetingâ to mean âAny
gathering, whether in person or by video or audio conference, telephone call,
electronic means (such as, without limitation, electronic mail, electronic
chat, and instant messaging), or other means of contemporaneous interactive
communication, of a majority of a quorum of the members of a public body held
for the purport of discussing public business,â and it permits attendance of

presence; and,
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To permit attendance by a means other than physical presence, the
Council of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois, must adopt rules
that conform to the requirements and restrictions of the Open Meetings Act,
ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, Â§ 7; and,

County, Illinois, find that it is necessary that any existing ordinances,
resolutions, or policies be amended to conform with the term âmeetingâ to
include electronic gatherings as defined in Section 120.1.02 of the Open
Meetings Act.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Adoption of Rules. The Council of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry

Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Electronic Attendance at Meetings Rules.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Rules Statement.  It is the decision of the City of Pinckneyville,
Perry County, Illinois, that any member of the City Council may attend any open
or closed meeting of the City Council via electronic means (such as by

compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prerequisites. A member of the City Council of the City of
Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois, may attend a meeting electronically if

the electronic attendance at the meeting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The member should notify the City Clerk at least two days before
the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications equipment can
be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical arrangements will result
in denial of a request for electronic attendance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The member must assert one of the following reasons why he or
she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or the
business of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The member cannot attend because of a family or other
emergency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The City Clerk, after receiving the electronic attendance
request, shall inform the City Council of the request for electronic
attendance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Voting procedures. After a roll call establishing that a quorum is

may be permitted to attend the meeting electronically after specifying the
reason entitling the absent member to attend electronically. The motion must be
approved by a vote of a majority of the members present.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Adequate equipment required. The member participating
electronically and other members of the City Council must be able to
communicate effectively, and members of the audience must be able to hear all
communication at the meeting site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any
meeting, the City Council shall provide equipment adequate to accomplish this
objective at the meeting site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Minutes. Any member attending electronically shall be considered on
off-site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting. The
meeting minutes shall also reflect and state specifically whether each member
is physically present or present by electronic means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Rights of remote member.  A member permitted to attend
electronically will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting
and participate in the same capacity as those members physically present,
subject to all general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and
adhered to. The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and
counted as to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending
electronically shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote
counted and recorded by the Clerk and placed in the minutes for the
corresponding meeting. A member attending electronically may leave a meeting
and return as in the case of any member, provided the member attending
electronically shall announce his or her leaving and returning.
Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Committees, boards, and commissions. These rules shall apply to all
committees, boards, and commissions established by authority of the City of
Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois.

manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum
security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the entity and conforming
to all state and local statues governing the investment of public funds.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Scope. This policy includes all funds governed by the City Council.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Prudence. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. The standard of prudence
to be used by investment officials shall be the âprudent personâ standard and
shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Objective. The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Legality - conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Safety - conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Liquidity - maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Yield - attainment of market rates of return.
The portfolio should be reviewed periodically as to its effectiveness in
meeting the entityâs needs for safety, liquidity, rate of return,
diversification and its general performance.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Delegation of authority. Management and administrative responsibility
for the investment program is hereby delegated to the City Treasurer who, under
the delegation of the City Council, shall establish written procedures for the
operation of the investment program.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Authorized financial dealers and institutions. The City Treasurer will
maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide investment
services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved security
brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Authorized and suitable investments. Investments may be made in any
type of security allowed for in state statutes regarding the investment of
public funds. Investments shall be made that reflect the cash flow needs of the
fund type being invested.

of deposit, etc.) in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits
must be secured by some form of collateral, witnessed by a written agreement
and held at an independent - third party institution in the name of the
municipality.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the city, shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by
an independent third party custodian designated by the City Treasurer and
evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written custodial agreement.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Diversification. The city shall diversify its investments to the best
of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of
those funds. Diversification can be by type of investment, number of
institutions invested in, and length of maturity.
Â Â Â (L)Â Â Â Maximum maturities. To the extent possible, the city shall attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
to a specific cash flow, the city will not directly invest in securities
maturing more than one year from the date of purchase. Reserve funds may be
invested in securities exceeding one year if the maturity of such investments
are made to coincide as nearly as practicable with the expected use of the
funds.
Â Â Â (M)Â Â Â Internal control. The City Treasurer is responsible for establishing
and maintaining an internal control structure designed to insure that the
assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal
control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance that these
objectives are met. The internal controls shall address the following points:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Control of collusion;

wire transfers.
Â Â Â (N)Â Â Â Performance standards. This investment portfolio will be managed in
accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio
should obtain a comparable rate of return during a market/economic environment
of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to
benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity and credit quality as the
portfolio. The cityâs benchmark will be the 90-day Treasury bill rate and/or
the state funds rate.
Â Â Â (O)Â Â Â Reporting. The City Treasurer shall prepare an investment report at
least monthly. The report
should be provided to the City Council and available on request. The report
should be in a format suitable for review by the general public. An annual
report should also be provided to the City Council.

shall be issued to the City Council quarterly.

Treasurer and any modifications made thereto must be approved by the City
Council.

forth the basis of the taxpayerâs request for a hearing. The written protest
and petition for hearing must be filed with the local tax administration within
45 days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a timely written notice and petition for hearing is filed, the
local tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within 14 days of receipt of the written protest and petition for hearing,
unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If a written protest and petition for hearing is not filed within
the 45 day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall become a
final bill due and owing without further notice.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time

time for filing a written protest for hearing be reopened or extended for more
than 90 days after the expiration of the 45 day period.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever a taxpayer or tax collector has filed a timely written
protest and petition for hearing under division (I) of this section, the local
tax administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a
continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack
of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed 14 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â At the hearing the local tax administrator shall preside and shall
hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination, audit
or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings

Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â At the conclusion of the hearing, the local tax administrator shall
make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the

Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Interest and penalties.  In the event a determination has been made
that a tax is due and owing, through audit, assessment or other bill sent, the
tax must be paid within the time frame otherwise indicated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Interest. The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 5%
per annum, based on a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed
within the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late
filing penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a
return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall
be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
Â Â Â (L)Â Â Â Abatement. The local tax administrator shall have the authority to
waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file
penalty if the local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists
for delay or failure to make a filing.
Â Â Â (M)Â Â Â Installment contracts. The city may enter into an installment contract
with the taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance.
The local tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered
unless the taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice
by the local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have 14 days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 day period or fails to demonstrate good
faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator,
the installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the
taxpayer.
Â Â Â (N)Â Â Â Statute of limitations.Â Â The city, through the local tax
administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and
inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days
after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for
refund or provide any tax still due and owing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If any tax return is not filed or if during any four year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
city, the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations
shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return
for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the
return for the applicable period was filed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
Â Â Â (O)Â Â Â Voluntary disclosure. For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
Â Â Â (P)Â Â Â Publication of tax ordinances.  Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the City Clerkâs office.
Â Â Â (Q)Â Â Â Lien review. The local tax administrator shall establish an internal
review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid
taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is
valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is
determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Timely remove the lien at the cityâs expense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Correct the taxpayerâs credit record; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
Â Â Â (R)Â Â Â Application. This section shall be liberally construed and
administered to supplement all of the cityâs tax ordinances. To the extent that
any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this section, this
section shall be controlling.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Â§ 34.10 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
Â Â Â It is unlawful to harass a person because of that personâs sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the City of Pinckneyville, Perry
County, Illinois, to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal
official, municipal agent, municipal employee, municipal agency or municipal
office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal
agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or municipal offices are
prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment
relationship or lack thereof.
(Ord. O-2020-17, passed 6-8-20)
Â§ 34.11 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Verbal harassment. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Non-verbal harassment. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, âcatcalls,â
âsmackingâ or âkissingâ noises.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Physical harassment. touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Textual/electronic harassment. âSextingâ (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a âreasonable person.â
(Ord. O-2020-17, passed 6-8-20)
Â§ 34.12 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the City Manager or
Administrator or the chief elected official of the municipality. The employee
experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that
the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim
fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality
will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official
of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the Human Resources Director,
the City Manager or Administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. O-2020-17, passed 6-8-20)
Â§ 34.13 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or officialâs involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, Â§ 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy
prohibits retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an
employee who does any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, Â§ 15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee
or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Ch. 775, Act 5, Â§ 6-
101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to
conspire to retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which
she/he reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in
employment, because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted or participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. O-2020-17, passed 6-8-20)
Â§ 34.14 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
Â Â Â In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or
the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in ILCS Ch. 5, Act 430, Â§ 5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable disciplinary
actions or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. O-2020-17, passed 6-8-20)
Â§ 34.15 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State
Police, a Stateâs Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement
official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

VEGETATIVE MATTER
Â§ 50.10 DISPOSAL OF VEGETATIVE MATTER.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â All leaves, hedge clippings, twigs, tree trimmings (not to exceed
eight inches in diameter), grass clippings, and similar vegetative refuse
placed for collection as hereinafter provided shall be collected and disposed
of by the city after the effective date of this section. All such vegetative
refuse shall be collected and disposed of by the city under the supervision of
the Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements who shall have the
authority to make regulations concerning the days of collection, manner in
which such vegetative refuse is made available for collection, and such other
matters pertaining to the collection and disposal of such refuse as he shall
find necessary and to change and modify the same after notice as required by
law; provided that such regulations are not contrary to the provisions hereof.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All owners, tenants, lessees, or occupants of premises lying within
the city who wish to avail themselves of such service shall rake such
vegetative refuse in convenient piles no further than five feet from the right-
of-way of any street within the city. No refuse other than leaves, hedge
clippings, twigs, tree trimmings (not to exceed eight inches in diameter),
grass clippings, and similar vegetative refuse shall be placed for collection.
The Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements shall provide notice of
anticipated collection routes and dates to each utility customer on a timely
basis, additionally, all such owners, tenants, lessees, or occupants may notify
the City Clerkâs office of any accumulated debris ready for collection and
disposal and the city will use its best efforts to remove the same within three
working days. The city shall have the right to enter upon each utility
customerâs property who has indicated their desire to utilize such services by
the placement of such vegetative refuse in an accessible location within five
feet of the public street or right-of-way. If further conditions or other
circumstances prevent the collection of such refuse on any scheduled day, then
the city may return within a reasonable period of time to avoid the undue
accumulation of refuse.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The fee for the collection and disposal of vegetative refuse as
provided for herein shall be $3 per month to all water customers residing
within the city. The fee shall be added as an additional charge on all
customersâ monthly billing; provided, however, that it shall be the duty of the
City Treasurer to set up and maintain an account separate from the waterworks
and sewerage system accounts in which all fees collected for this service shall
be placed.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â An additional fee is hereby imposed upon the homeowner for the removal
of trees and branches left by private contractors or subcontractors pursuant to
trimming or tree removal services to the property owner. The fee for the
collection and disposal of vegetative matter resulting from the removal of
trees and branches by private contractors or subcontractors shall be $250 per
small truck (pickup) load (up to and including two cubic yards) and $500 per
large truck (dump truck) load (over two cubic yards and up to five cubic
yards). Any accumulation of refuse at any residence exceeding two cubic yards
shall presumptively be the result of the removal of entire trees or branches by
private contractors or subcontractors and maybe collected at the discretion of
the city for the charge set forth above. The additional charge shall be
assessed against the property owner on the immediately succeeding billing
period for utilities. It shall be the duty of the City Treasurer to set up and
maintain an account separate from the waterworks and sewerage system accounts
in which all fees collected for this service shall be placed. The fees charged
pursuant to this division may be held in an account with fees collected
pursuant to division (C) above.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Except as provided for herein, no person, firm or corporation shall
deposit or burn any vegetative refuse on any city property or right-of-way. No
person shall discharge grass clippings or other vegetative matter from mowing
or other activities upon any city street, sidewalk or right-of-way. Any person,
firm or corporation who violates the provisions of this section, upon
conviction, shall be fined not less than $100 and no more than $750 for each
offense, together with the costs as set forth herein for the removal of such
vegetative matter from the city street, sidewalk, right-of-way or city
property. Any person, firm or corporation arrested or issued a citation for a
violation of this section may appear at the office of the City Clerk within
three to five days thereafter and pay to the Clerk the sum of the minimum fine
and cost of removal of the vegetative refuse. The payment of that sum to the
Clerk shall be deemed a waiver of process, an entry of appearance, a waiver of
jury trial and a plea of guilty to violation of this section and the sum so
paid shall be deemed a voluntary payment of a fine and cost for the violation,
and shall bar further prosecution thereof.

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In the event of discontinuance, gas service shall not be renewed until
the city authorities have purged the lines. Authorized personnel shall relight
pilots. In no case shall the customer turn on his or her own service. The
purging of lines, relighting pilots and checking automatic controls will be
done by the city. Where the nature of the customerâs operations are such that
an interruption of service might create a hazard or large economic loss, the
customer shall provide facilities for standby at his or her discretion.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Any customer with critical natural gas requirements must have dual
fuel facilities and on-site storage of the alternate fuel. Failure to provide
that shall be considered a violation of customer rules and loss or damage
resulting therefrom shall be the responsibility of the customer. Those
customers shall include, but not be limited to, hospitals, nursing homes,
schools, greenhouses, hatcheries, or any other building or business which might
suffer any type of loss due to interruption of natural gas service.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The city expressly stipulates with all customers and other persons who
may be affected by the discontinuance of service that it neither will insure
nor be responsible or liable in any manner for any loss or damages direct or
indirect by reason of fire, or for any other cause and all gas service
furnished also shall be conditional upon acts of God, inevitable accidents,
failure of supply, fires, strike, riot or any other cause.

Â§ 51.42 METER TESTS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any customer may request the city to make a test of the accuracy of
the meter then in use on their premises. The tests will be made by the city
without charge, provided the meter has not been tested within seven years
preceding such a request. In case a customer requests an accuracy test of a
meter which has been tested previously within seven years, the customer shall
be required, before the test, to deposit with the city the sum of $35 to cover
the cost of removing, testing and replacing the meter.

51.41 shall be applicable in determining accuracy of meters being tested.
Refunds of additional charges will be based on determinations made according to
those standards.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â In the event a meter is found, by testing, to register incorrectly at
full capacity by more than 2%, the test deposit shall be refunded. Past gas
bills shall be adjusted by the percentage of the amount of the gas bills for a
period of not more than six months before the test.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â In the event the meter is found to be registering correctly, the
customer shall forfeit the test deposit and the money shall be deposited in the

break the seal of any meter or in any manner to make alterations, changes or
repairs on the same or to open any mains, laterals, service pipes, stop cocks,
valves or any part thereof or otherwise tamper with or attempt to do any work
on either or any of the same without authority of the city or its properly
authorized agents. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this
division or who shall willfully or maliciously injure or damage any property

Â§ 52.001 WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM COMBINED.
Â Â Â The City Council deems it advisable, necessary and in the best interest of
the city that the existing municipally owned waterworks system of the city and
the existing municipally owned sewerage system of the city be combined and
operated and maintained as a combined waterworks and sewerage system, the
combined system to include the entire waterworks and sewerage facilities of the
city, including all future improvements and extensions thereto.

Â§ 52.003 USE OF WATER ON CUSTOMERâS PREMISES.
Â Â Â The city shall have the right to use the water from the customerâs

customer for the use of his or her facilities and no charge shall be made by
the city for the water used by the city.
(Ord. O-82-1, passed 2-1-82; Am. Ord. O-88-5, passed 4-18-88; Am. Ord. 0-97-7,

Â§ 52.004 CITY NOT LIABLE FOR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE OR SUPPLY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city shall have the right to shut off the supply of water and/or
sewer service at any time to make repairs, improvements, enforce rules or for
any operating reason. Where possible, a reasonable notice of the circumstances
will be given to the customers, but in an emergency, water and sewer service
may be shut off without notice. The city shall not be held responsible or
liable because of any shutoff, discontinuance or service, failure of any part
of the system, for concentration of water or for any direct or resultant
damages to any person, company or customer.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In the event of the discontinuance, water and/or sewer services shall
not be renewed until the city authorities have determined it is in the best
interest of the customer to restore the service. In no case shall the customer
turn on his own service. The turning on or shutting off of valves will be done
by the city. Where the nature of the customerâs operations are such that an
interruption of service might create a hazard or large economic loss, the
customer shall provide facilities for standby at his or her discretion.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Any customer with critical water requirements must have an alternate
water source. Failure to provide it shall be consideration a violation of
customer rules and loss or damages resulting therefrom shall be the
responsibility of the customer. Those customers shall include, but not be
limited to, manufacturers, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, greenhouses,
hatcheries or any other building or business which might suffer any type of
loss due to interruption of water or sewer service.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The city expressly stipulates with all customers and other persons who
may be affected by the discontinuance of service that it will neither insure
nor be responsible or liable in any manner for any loss or damages, direct or
indirect, by reason of fire or any other cause and all water and sewer service
furnished also shall be conditional upon acts of God, inevitable accidents,
failure of supply, fire, strikes, riots or any other causes.

shall be subject to approval of the City Council and also shall be subject to
all of the rules, regulations and provisions as provided herein or as amended.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The Council first shall determine if any extension of water main is
economically feasible, based on the estimated costs of the extension and the
number of existing potential users that will use water along the extension. If
the extension is economically feasible, the city may install and pay the cost
of the extension at the discretion of the Council. All mains, lines and
equipment shall immediately become the property of the city.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If the Council elects not to pay the costs of extending the mains, the
person or persons desiring the service may install the extension at their own
personal expense, upon the written consent by the Council. The city shall not
pay for any extension to an undeveloped area, such as a subdivision being
developed, unless there are sufficient existing residents or businesses to make
the extension economically feasible.

Â§ 52.023 WATER LEAK INSURANCE COVERAGE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Mayor and City Clerk are authorized to procure and place in force
water leak insurance coverage through Sunbelt Insurance Group to provide
coverage for lost city revenue resulting from adjustments to customer water and
sewer bills for customer water leaks.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Effective with bills for city water and sewer services issued in
October 2017, the city shall charge each water and sewer customer of city the
sum of $ 1.40 per month to apply toward the premium cost of the water leak
insurance coverage. Such monthly charge shall be in addition to the monthly
charges for usage.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Any water or sewer customer of the city who wishes to terminate or
prevent the monthly charge for the water leak insurance premium may decline
coverage and waive the right to request bill adjustments by signing and
delivering to the City Clerk a written election to decline such coverage. The
City Clerk shall provide an election form to any customer upon request. No
charge for water leak insurance shall be added to any subsequent monthly bill
for any water or sewer customer who provides the written election form to the
City Clerk. City water and sewer customers who decline insurance coverage and
who waive the right to request an adjustment to water and sewer bills shall
remain responsible for payment of all water and sewer charges in full as shown
by the metered usage as provided in Â§
52.051 of the City Code. Such customers shall not be entitled to any adjustment
of excess charges resulting from leaks in customerâs service lines.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â For any city water and sewer customer who pays the monthly charge for
the premium cost of water leak insurance, the customer may one time each twelve
month period request an adjustment to the customerâs water and sewer bill and a
reduction in âexcess chargesâ resulting from leaks in customerâs water lines.
The excess charges shall be calculated to equal the amount by which a monthly
bill for water and sewer services exceeds the preceding 12 month average bill
for such customer. The city as an exception to Â§Â 
52.051 of the City Code will forgive one half the amount of such excess charges
upon proof that customer has repaired the leak. The customer shall be
responsible for payment of the remaining one half share of the excess charges,
plus the charges equal to customerâs preceding 12 month average bill. Customer
shall be entitled to an adjustment for charges arising from water leaks one
time during each 12 month period. Any customer who is allowed an adjustment
will cooperate with city to support the claim for benefits under the cityâs
water leak insurance coverage.

a request for an extension of such time period is approved by the Commissioner
of Streets and Public Improvements or the Mayor. If the repair affects any
paved street or oil and chipped street, the disturbed area shall be filled to
grade level immediately after the repair is completed. Within the 60-day period
after repairs are commenced, the affected area shall be restored with concrete
which shall be level with the grade of the street. The concrete to restore
streets, alleys, and roadways shall be no less than 12 inches thick with a
brushed finish. The concrete to restore sidewalks shall be no less than six

street is affected by the repair, fill dirt must be replaced and the area
seeded with grass to restore the area to the condition which existed before the
repair. Notwithstanding the above specified time periods for repairs, damages
from repairs made in April or May of any calendar year must be repaired and the
area restored, including the required concrete fill, by May 31 of the same year
to accommodate the usual schedule of the city for oil and chipping of streets
in June.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon restoration of the affected city street, alley, roadway, curb,
or sidewalk to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Streets and Public
Improvements, the permittee's check to city shall be returned to the permittee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the restoration of any affected city street, alleyway, roadway,
curb, or sidewalk is not completed by the permittee to the satisfaction of the
city within 60 days of the commencement of the repair work, or such additional
time as may be approved by the Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements
or the Mayor, the city shall negotiate the check tendered as security to apply
toward the cost to city for completing the restoration.

service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service charges can be computed.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The capital improvement charge is levied on all users to provide for
capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewage treatment
works. The capital improvement is computed by apportioning the annual amount to
be accrued as a cost per 1,000 gallons or as a fixed charge per month.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A five-day, 20Â° C. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD of 200 mg/l).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/1.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The charge shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
costs to each user class by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Compute surcharge costs per pound per 1,000 gallons, in excess
of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the
normal domestic con- centrations of BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l). The
surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 240 mg/
l concentration for BOD and SS respectively.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed,
not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for the city in
their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised
periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or a change in
operation and maintenance costs including, replacement costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The users of wastewater treatment services will be notified
annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of
the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation,

surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 10 gallons.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the Commissioner of Public Works for the purpose of determining the
volume of water obtained from these other sources.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the Commissioner of these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Metering devices for determining the volume of wastes shall be

Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â Failure to give information after striking unattended vehicle or
other property (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, Â§ 11-404).
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Other actions leading to motor vehicle seizure and impoundment. A
motor vehicle operated or used while soliciting, possessing, or attempting to
solicit or possess cannabis or a controlled substance, as defined by the
Cannabis Control Act or the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, Â§ 11-208.7) shall be subject to seizure and impoundment under this
Ordinance.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Officers to impound vehicles. When an officer has probable cause to
believe that a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impound as provided in
this subchapter, the officer shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Notify the on-duty supervisor, or if no supervisor is on duty,
notify the next supervisor that is on duty of the seizure and impoundment and
the nature of the offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Inventory and provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility
listed on the towing list as provided in Â§

to be held until the Pinckneyville Police Department authorizes its release;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When practical, the officer shall allow the removal of personal
property from the vehicle prior to towing if the property is not needed for
evidence, subject to forfeiture or otherwise needed to be maintained by the
police. Officers generally will not wait at the scene of any seizure to allow
the removal of personal property or the summoning of persons to remove
property. Persons under arrest will generally not be allowed to remove property
prior to their release; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Prepare a written police report, notice of seizure (when
immediately deliverable) and tow report, when practical, prior to ending his or
her shift. The preparation of the police report allows for the conduct of a
preliminary hearing, supervisory review and review by the evidence custodian
for possible release of personal property. The report shall state whether the
vehicle or property contained therein is subject to forfeiture or is to be held
for any other reason.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Notice.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Immediately upon seizure of the vehicle pursuant to this
subchapter, the Officer shall notify the person who is found to be in control
of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person,
of the fact of the vehicleâs seizure and of the vehicle ownerâs right to
request a preliminary hearing as provided for this subchapter. When no person
is present to receive said notification, officers shall make a reasonable
attempt to notify the owner of record.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to
this subchapter, the city shall notify by certified mail, return receipt
requested, the owner of record at his or her last known address, as indicated
by the vehicleâs registration, of his or her right to request a final hearing
before the Hearing Officer to determine whether the subject vehicle is eligible
for impoundment pursuant to this section. However, no such notice need be sent
to the owner of record if the owner is personally served with the notice within
ten days after the vehicle is impounded and the owner acknowledges receipt of
the notice in writing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The written notice as required in division (D)(2) of this section
shall state the penalties that may be imposed if no hearing is requested,
including that a vehicle not released by payment of the penalty, fees and
remaining towing/storage fees may be sold or disposed of by the city in
accordance with applicable law.

prior to hearing to a person entitled to lawful possession of said vehicle upon
payment to the police agency of a fee of $500, plus any and all towing and
storage charges.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The penalty set forth in division (E)(1)(a) of this section will
be refunded by the city in the event that, upon final hearing as provided in
division (G) of this section, the Hearing Officer determines that the vehicle
was not used in the commission of a violation as set forth in division (A) of
this section or impounded pursuant to division (B) of this section. Under such
circumstance, the vehicle shall be released from impoundment to its owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a
person, corporation, or business entity with a valid lien or valid security
interest against a vehicle impounded under this subchapter has commenced
foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person
or agent for said entity with a valid lien, to refund to the city the net
proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien
holders of record, up to the total amount of penalties and fees imposed under
this subchapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a person entitled to lawful possession does not redeem the
impounded vehicle within 30 days after the vehicle is impounded or after the
Hearing Officerâs written determination, whichever is later, then such vehicle
shall be disposed or in accordance with the procedure set forth for disposal of
unclaimed or abandoned vehicles as provided by law.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Preliminary hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever the owner of a vehicle seized pursuant to this subchapter
requests in writing, within 12 hours after the seizure, and hand delivered to
the Pinckneyville Police Department, 104 S. Walnut Street, Pinckneyville,
Illinois, a preliminary hearing on probable cause, a Hearing Officer appointed
by the city shall conduct at the Pinckneyville City Hall, such preliminary
hearing within 72 hours of the seizure, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
be heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal Rules of Evidence will not
apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible.

probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used in the commission of any
crime or violation described in division (A) or (B) of this section, the
Hearing Officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as
provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the city a
cash bond of $500 plus fees for towing and storing of the vehicle as provided
in division (E)(1) of this section. If the Hearing Officer determines that
there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be returned without penalty
or other fees.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â For purposes of this section, the Hearing Officer shall be a
licensed attorney who is not an employee of the City of Pinckneyville.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Final hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request
for a hearing with the Chief of Police of the City of Pinckneyville, at the

cause by order of the Hearing Officer, not later than 45 days after the request
for a hearing has been filed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
be heard at the hearing. The formal Rules of Evidence will not apply at the
hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible.

preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in the commission of
any crime or violation described in division (A) or(B) of this section, the
Hearing Officer shall enter an order requiring the vehicle to continue to be
impounded until the owner pays a penalty of $500 plus fees for towing and
storage of the vehicle as provided in division (E)(1)(a) of this section. The
penalty and fees shall be a debt due and owing the city. However, if a cash
bond has been posted, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If the Hearing
Officer determines that the vehicle was not used in commission of such a
violation, he or she shall order the return of the vehicle or cash bond as
provided in division (E)(1)(b) of this section.
Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â For purposes of this section, the Hearing Officer shall be a licensed
attorney who is not an employee of the City of Pinckneyville.

additional $50,000 for property damage.

by the City without authorization of the Chief of Police.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The towing company shall maintain records and a claim check system

of Police to inspect its wreckers, vault, security room or storage area at such
times as the Chief of Police shall deem appropriate.

abatement.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the expenses due the city for abatement of the nuisance are not
paid within 30 days after the notice of discontinuation of utility services is
given to the responsible owner, occupant or lessee, all water, gas or other

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY
FACILITIES IN CITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY
Â§ 95.20 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the cityâs
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
cityâs utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;

materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;

adjacent to utility facilities locations.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this subchapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
subchapter.

that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.

subchapters or parts of subchapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of such conflict.

regulations and city will enforce the terms and requirements of this subchapter
to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state law or
regulations.

retailers.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220,
Act 65, Â§ 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it

Â§ 95.25 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on city rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this subchapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The preconstruction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. O-2019-25, passed 11-12-19) Penalty, see Â§
95.99
Â§ 95.26 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
Â Â Â In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with Â§
95.40 of this subchapter. If the city denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Within ten days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under
the Workers Compensation Act.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the

Â Â Â By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this subchapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
subchapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. O-2019-25, passed 11-12-19)
Â§ 95.29 SECURITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve a security for:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this subchapter;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the city must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
(B) shall, at a minimum:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Commissioner of Public Property or the
Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Commissioner of
Public Property or the Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this division (C) for any single phase.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the city, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
subchapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the
permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall
become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable
costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Â§ 115.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually
oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish
reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and
concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter
to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected
by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the
intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene materials.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made
available to the City Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of
City of Erie v. Papâs A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 146 L.Ed.2d 265, 120 S.Ct. 1382
(2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478
U.S. 697, (1986); Iacobucci v. City of Newport, Ky., 479 U.S. 92 (1986); Young
v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S.
109 (1972); United States v. OâBrien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. City of
Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d
1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th
Cir.1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608
(11th Cir.1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. City of Houston, 27 F.Supp.2d 754
(S.D. Tex.1998)), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but
not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles,
California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in
the Final Report of the Attorney Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986),
the Report of the Attorney Generalâs Working Group On the Regulation Of
Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics
obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the City Council finds that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of
these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their
premises.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-
related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually
oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix,
Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
See, e.g., California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report
of the Attorney Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such
activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the
Attorney Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud
Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney
Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and
shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â As of June, 2001, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the
United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 793,025. See,
e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â As of December, 2001, there have been more than 26,200 reported
cases of AIDS in the State of Illinois. See http://www.idph.state.il.us/public-
/hb/hbaids.htm.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis
infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a 6% increase
over the year 1999. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://
www.cdc.gov.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis
in the United States reported during the four year period 1996-2000 was
212,672. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases reported
during the period 1996-2000. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http:/
/www.cdc.gov.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected
blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV
infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by
sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities
and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney
Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids,
including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented
businesses where persons view âadultâ oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report
of the Attorney Generalâs Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (16)Â Â Â Adult uses have operational characteristics that should be
reasonably regulated in order to protect substantial governmental concerns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (17)Â Â Â Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution,
increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (18)Â Â Â Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of
drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d
1053, 1056 (9th Cir. 1986).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (19)Â Â Â Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the
likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and
encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public
health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. City of
Warner Robins, 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.2000); Sammyâs Ltd. v. City of
Mobile, 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146
L.Ed.2d 459, 120 S.Ct. 1553 (2000). The findings noted in divisions (B)(1)
through (B)(18) raise substantial governmental concerns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (20)Â Â Â Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (21)Â Â Â A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of
sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a
heretofore non-existent incentive on operators to see that the sexually
oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and
welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It
is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual
operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of
the premises and activities occurring therein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (22)Â Â Â Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting
on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest
in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult
establishments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (23)Â Â Â The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (24)Â Â Â It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of
communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding
certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to
prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (25)Â Â Â When more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the
same location or business address, the secondary effects caused by such
businesses are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a
greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business use is allowed to
occupy the same location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (26)Â Â Â The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of
this city will be promoted by enactment of this chapter.

Â§ 116.02 FINDINGS.
Â Â Â The City hereby makes the following findings as supported by the City
Business District Plan:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Business District Plan constitutes a specific plan for a business
district in the City of Pinckneyville, Perry County, Illinois.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The designation of the Business District, as more specifically
described in the Business District Plan, will assure opportunities for
development and redevelopment, and attraction of quality commercial growth to
the City.

existing Comprehensive Plan for the city.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The Cityâs exercise of the powers provided in the Act is dedicated to
the promotion of the public interest and to the enhancement of the tax base of
the business districtâs and the Cityâs use of the powers for the development
and redevelopment of the business district as provided in the Business District
Plan is declared to be a public use essential to the public interest of the

(Ord. O-08-01, passed 3-10-08)
Â§ 116.03 APPROVAL OF CITY BUSINESS DISTRICT PLAN.

Â§ 116.04 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CITY BUSINESS DISTRICT PLAN.
Â Â Â The City Business District is hereby established pursuant to the Business

possess without limitation, such powers with respect to the business district
as authorized under the Business District Act and the Business District Plan.
(Ord. O-08-01, passed 3-10-08)
Â§ 116.05 FINDINGS RELATED TO BUSINESS DISTRICT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The City hereby finds the area included in the Business District to be
a âblighted areaâ as such term is used under the Business District Act based on
the facts as set forth in the Business District Plan. The Business District
shall have such additional powers available to the business district under the
Business District Act as a result of the area in the Business District being a
blighted area, including the power to impose a retailersâ occupation tax, a
service occupation tax, and a hotel operatorsâ occupation tax in the business
district for the planning, execution, and implementation of the Business
District Plan.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The City hereby makes the following findings with respect to the
property within the business district pursuant to the Business District Act:

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Business District includes only parcels of real property
directly and substantially benefitted by the Business District Plan;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Business District, in its entirety, is located within the city
limits;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Business District is a blighted area; that, by reason of the
predominance of defective or inadequate street layout, unsanitary or unsafe
conditions, deterioration of site improvements, or the existence of conditions
which endanger life or property by fire or other causes, or any combination of
those factors, constitutes an economic or social liability or a menace to the
public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition and use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Business District, on the whole, has not been subject to growth
and development through investment by private enterprises or would not
reasonably be anticipated to be developed without the adoption of the Business
District Plan; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The Business District Plan conforms to the Comprehensive Plan for
the development of the municipality as a whole, as determined by the City
Council.

PERMITS
Â§ 150.30 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
Â Â Â No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law
shall commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Commissioner of Public Property. The Commissioner
of Public Property shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line
dimensions;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of Â§
150.41.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the
Commissioner of Public Property shall compare the elevation of the site to the
base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown by
survey data to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the date of
the siteâs first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification is not in the
floodplain and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The
Commissioner of Public Property shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site, and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the siteâs first Flood Insurance Rate
Map identification.

lieu of elevation), provided a registered professional engineer or architect
certifies that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Below the flood protection elevation, the structure and
attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the
effects of the base flood;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The building design accounts for flood velocities, duration,
rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and
the impact from debris and ice; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Floodproofing measures will be incorporated into the building
design, and operable without human intervention and without an outside source

standards of this chapter exists. The Commissioner of Public Property shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter, or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $100 nor more than $200; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The Commissioner of Public Property shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and,
therefore, may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

Â§ 154.050 ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS DECISION ON VARIANCE.
Â Â Â Within a reasonable time after public hearing on the application for a
variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its decision after
considering the following factors:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The proposed variance is consistent with the general purpose of this
chapter;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The proposed variance does not involve a use of land not permitted in
the zone district;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Strict application of the district requirements would result in great
practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and prevent a reasonable
return on the property;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such requirements
that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and allow a reasonable return on
the property;
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â The plight of the applicant is due to circumstances not from his own
making;
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The circumstances engendering the variance request are peculiar and
not applicable to other property within the district and, therefore, that a
variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (re-zoning); and
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the area where the premises in question are located nor materially frustrate
implementation of the cityâs Comprehensive Plan.

Â 
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Whenever any street, alley, or other public right-of-way is legally
vacated, the zoning districts adjoining each side of such vacated public way
shall automatically extend to the center of such way, and all territory
included in the vacated way shall thereafter be subject to all regulations of
the extended districts.

development For example, non-conformities are frequently responsible for truck
traffic on residential streets, the overtaxing of parking facilities, the
creation of nuisances, and/or the lowering of property values. The regulations
of this subchapter are intended to alleviate such existing or potential
problems by encouraging the gradual elimination of non-conformities. However,

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
Â§ 154.340 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
Â Â Â This subchapter establishes provisions for rezoning of land within the city
to provide for a Planned Unit Development (PUD). The purpose of this
subchapter, Planned Unit Development, is to achieve the objectives enumerated
in Â§
154.001 plus the following additional objectives:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â To provide a regulatory mechanism whereby the city can be assured that
upon completion, approved development projects will substantially conform to
the plans or models which constituted the basis for the cityâs issuance of the
necessary zoning, subdivision, and/or building permits;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â To permit development of a wide variety of building types and other
structures and uses in a single comprehensively planned project;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â To preserve the significant and prime farm land, natural topography,
scenic features, mature trees, and historic structures existing on sites
proposed for development;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â To encourage innovative site layouts and coordinated architectural
treatment of different building types and other structures and uses;
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â To ensure the provision of usable common open space in planned
developments, and to spur installation of various amenities therein;
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â To facilitate the economical installation of standard streets, sewers,
utilities, and other improvements.
(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)
Â§ 154.341 COMPLIANCE WITH ORDINANCES.
Â Â Â Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section, Planned Unit
Developments (PUDs) shall, comply and conform with all applicable codes and
ordinances including this Zoning Chapter and the Subdivision Ordinance.
(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)
Â§ 154.342 WHERE DISTRICTS ARE ALLOWED.
Â Â Â Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) may be built in any geographic location
affected by this chapter, but only upon rezoning and a Planned Unit Development
District by the Zoning Commission.
(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)
Â§ 154.343 PERMISSIBLE DEVIATION FROM ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS.
Â Â Â The Planned Unit Development (PUD) concept is intended to afford both the
developer and the city considerable flexibility in formulating development
proposals. Consequently, to the extent indicated in this section, PUDs may
deviate from generally applicable ordinance requirements without a variance.
Any proposed deviation not listed below, however, shall require a variance.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Mixed uses. PUDs may include all types of buildings and other
structures and uses approved by the Zoning Commission; provided, that in
approving such mixed construction and uses, the Zoning Commission may attach
any conditions necessary to protect the public welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Lot and structure requirements. In PUDs, the Zoning Commission may
approve any reasonable deviation from the lot and structure requirements of the
particular zoning district so long as the different uses within the PUD are
appropriately interrelated and property abutting the PUD is adequately
protected from any potential adverse impacts of the development. LOT AND
STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS means minimum individual lot area, width, and depth;
minimum setbacks; and maximum structure height.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Location of parking/loading spaces. By permission of the Zoning
Commission, off-street parking and loading spaces in PUDs need not be located
in accordance with generally applicable requirements. The minimum number of
such spaces, however, shall not be less than the number required as per Â§Â§
154.320 through
154.328.
(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)

conformity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Replaced by another non- conforming street sign or graphic

Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Corrective action orders. Whenever the Zoning Administrator finds, by

this subchapter, he/she shall so notify the responsible party and shall order
appropriate corrective action. Provided that this notice requirement shall not

graphic poses an imminent peril to life or property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Contents of order. The order to take corrective action shall be in
writing and shall include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A description of the premises sufficient for identification;

result in revocation of the street sign or graphic permit, and may result in
remedial action by this city and/or the imposition of a fine.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Service of order. A corrective action order shall be deemed
properly served upon the owner of the offending street sign or graphic if it
is:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Served upon him/her personally;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Sent by certified mail with return receipts to his/her last
known address; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Posted in a conspicuous place on or about the affected premises.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Remedial action of city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever the recipient of a corrective action order fails to obey

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any expense incurred by the city pursuant to authorized street sign
or graphic remedial action shall be billed by first class mail to the owner of
the offending street sign or graphic. If said bill has not been paid within 30
days, the unpaid charge shall constitute a lien upon the real estate where the
street graphic is located. The City Attorney is hereby authorized to file a
notice of lien in the office of the Count Recorder of Deeds, to foreclose this
lien, and to sue the owner of the real estate, or sign permittee, or their
agents, in a civil action to recover the money due for the foregoing services,
plus all expenses incurred pursuant to collection efforts including litigation
expenses, plus reasonable attorneyâs fees to be fixed by the court.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Complaints. Whenever any violation of this subchapter occurs, or is

provided by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall record the
complaints, promptly investigate, and if he/she deems necessary, initiate
appropriate corrective action.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Fees. All permit fees, or fees for appeals or variance, shall be
established by the City Council by resolution and shall be paid to the City
Clerk. These fees are intended to defray the administrative costs connected
with the processing/conducting of the listed permits/procedures; they do not
constitute a tax or other revenue-raising device.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Variance. A sign variance is a relaxation of the strict application of
requirements of this chapter that are applicable to a particular lot, structure
or sign. Every request for a variance shall be treated in accordance with
Illinois law (see ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, Â§ 11-13-5, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, Â§ 11-13-6,
ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, Â§ 11-13-7, ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, Â§ 11-13-7a) as provided in Â§
154.051.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Every applicant for a sign variance shall submit to the Zoning
Administrator, on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator, the items of
information listed below. The Zoning Administrator shall promptly transmit the
completed application to the Zoning Board of Appeals together with any
recommendations or comments the Zoning Board of Appeals may deem appropriate
for their review and consideration.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Name and address of the applicant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Location of the lot or structure for which the sign variance is
sought;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Relationship of said lot or structure to adjacent lots or
structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Specific section(s) of this chapter containing the regulations
which, if strictly applied, would cause a serious problem; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Other pertinent information that the Zoning Administrator may
deem appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each
variance request within a reasonable time after the variance application is
submitted to them. At the hearing any interested party (including any school or
other taxing district in which the property in question is located) may appear
and testify, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. Notice
of the hearing shall be given not more than 30 nor less than 15 days before the
hearing:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â By first class mail to the applicant and to all parties whose
properties are within 100 feet the property for which the sign variance is
sought; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â By publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the
city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Within a reasonable time after public hearing on the application
for a variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its decision after
considering the following factors. The proposed variance is consistent with the
general purpose of this chapter:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Strict application of the requirements would result in great
practical difficulties or hardship to the applicant, and prevent a reasonable
return on the property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The proposed variance is the minimum deviation from such
requirements that will alleviate the difficulties/hardship, and allow a
reasonable return on the property;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The plight of the applicant is due to circumstances not from his
own making;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The circumstances engendering the variance request are peculiar
and not applicable to other property within the district and, therefore, that a
sign variance would be a more appropriate remedy than an amendment (re-zoning);
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the area where the premises in question are located nor materially frustrate
implementation of the cityâs Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Zoning
Administrator in any matter related to the interpretation or enforcement of any
provisions of this subchapter may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Filing, stay of further proceedings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Every appeal shall be made within ten days of the matter
complained of by filing with the Zoning Administrator a written notice
specifying the grounds for appeal. Thereupon, the Zoning Administrator shall
promptly transmit all pertinent records to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â An appeal stays all further actions on the matter being appealed
unless the Zoning Administrator certified to the Zoning Board of Appeals, after
the notice of appeal has been filed with him/her, that for reason stated in the
certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, further action shall not be stayed unless the Zoning Board of Appeals or
the circuit court grants a restraining order for due cause, and so notifies the
Zoning Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Public hearing, notice. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider
every appeal within a reasonable time after the filing of the notice of appeal
pursuant to division (H)(1) above and shall act upon such not later than 30
days after the filing of the appeal. The Zoning Administrator shall notify the
appellant and all interested parties of the time and place at which the appeal
shall be heard and post public notice of the proceeding at City Hall. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall render a decision on the appeal by a simple
majority vote of all members then holding office or may modify or amend the
order appealed to the extent and in a manner as is appropriate in its
discretion. The Zoning Board of Appeals decision may be appealed to the City
Council as provided in Â§
154.057.

the provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. O-2014-06, passed 8-11-14)
Â§ 154.397 SIGN REMOVAL.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Any sign hereafter existing which advertises a business no longer
being conducted or a product no longer being sold on the premises upon which
the sign is located shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent or
person having the beneficial use of the building, structure or premises upon

Administrator and, upon failure to comply with such notice within the time
specified in such order, the Zoning Administrator is hereby authorized to cause

owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the building, structure or
premises to which the sign is attached.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â All temporary signs including banners shall be removed within one week

a separate offense.

collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the city may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of
the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right
to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the
alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional
material costs as determined by the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
