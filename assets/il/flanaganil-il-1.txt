codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect and are

Trustees as the Village President may appoint, with the advice and consent of
the Board of Trustees. The Village President may, from time to time, appoint
persons other than Village Trustees to standing committees, with the advice and
consent of the Board of Trustees, although such persons shall not have voting
rights within the committees, nor shall such persons have the ability to attend
closed session meetings of the committee without the consent of a majority of
the Trustees who are committee members in attendance at the committee meeting.
The Village President shall be an ex officio member of all such committees,
with the right to attend any portion of any committee meeting.
   (C)   Standing committees shall have the power and authority to review and
suggest policy for the village on the topics under their review, for approval
by the Village President or Village Board of Trustees, and shall have such
other power and authority as the Village President or Village Board of Trustees
shall delegate to the committees by ordinance or resolution. The corporate
authorities of the village may, by ordinance or resolution, adopt such further
policies or directives as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to further
define the power and authority of any standing committee. It shall be the duty
of the standing committees of the Board of Trustees to keep a close watch over
the affairs of the departments of the village. They shall make reports and
provide recommendations to the President and Board of Trustees. Each committee
shall promptly and thoroughly investigate and report in writing upon all
matters referred to it by the Board of Trustees or President and do and perform
such other and further duties as the Board of Trustees may require by
ordinance, resolution, or motion, or as the Village President shall direct.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village President shall have primary
supervisory authority and power of direction over village staff and village
department heads and shall exercise daily authority over all village employees.
Village staff and employees shall not, without the authorization of the
President or Board of Trustees, refer matters to committees without the
approval of the Village President, and no Trustee shall, without the
authorization of the Village President or the approval of the Board of
Trustees, provide direction to village employees.
   (D)   Standing committees shall have the power and authority to make
recommendations to the corporate authorities of the village regarding the
topics under their review. Such recommendations may be approved or rejected by
vote of the corporate authorities of the village.
   (E)   Standing committees shall not, without further ordinance or
resolution, have the authority to bind the village or the corporate authorities
of the village. Any action which requires approval by the Board of Trustees or
corporate authorities of the village may only be approved by such board or
authority at a meeting thereof, unless the village shall adopt such further
ordinance or resolution which delegates to any committee any discrete power. No
action of a standing committee is official without approval by the Village
Board of Trustees.
   (F)   Standing committees shall be treated as committees of the village and
shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not
limited to, the Open Meetings Act, being 5 ILCS 120/1 et seq.
   (G)   The Village President shall designate, from the ranks of each
committee, a person to serve as Committee Chair; said Committee Chair shall
designate a person to serve as Secretary. The Committee Chair shall be
responsible for the orderly and professional conduct of committee meetings and
for ensuring that all notices pertaining to such meetings are properly served
and/or posted, and the secretary shall be responsible for keeping such minutes
of such meetings as shall be required under applicable law.
   (H)   There shall be no compensation due to any person for serving on a
standing committee of the village.
(Ord. 2009-O, passed - -2009)
§ 30.07 COMPENSATION.

office, the Village Trustees so elected at such election shall be paid a salary
of $75 per month. Trustees shall be entitled to miss up to two regular meetings
of the Board of Trustees; thereafter, no Trustee shall receive compensation
under this section in any month in which the Trustee misses a third, or
following the regular meeting of the Board of Trustees. Additionally, such
Trustees shall receive reimbursement for any expenses incurred by the Trustees
in the performance or furtherance of the official duties of the office.
Further, commencing on May 1, 2010, and effective each May 1 thereafter, the
Trustees shall receive an increase in compensation in an amount equal to the
property tax extension limitation law tax cap percentage for the then current
year. For all terms of office which commence at any point in time later than
April 2009, including terms of office for Trustees elected at later elections,
the Trustees so elected shall be compensated at a rate equivalent to the terms
of office which begin as a result of the consolidated election of April 2009,
including all increases in compensation. For all terms of office which commence

SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
§ 31.45 PROHIBITION.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991, being 42 U.S.C.
§§ 2000e et seq. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from
sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects
individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the
village to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official,
municipal agent, municipal employee, municipal agency, or municipal office on
the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents,
municipal employees, and municipal agencies or municipal offices are prohibited
from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship
or lack thereof.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020) Penalty, see §
31.99
§ 31.46 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a different meaning.
   SEXUAL HARASSMENT. As stated in the State Human Rights Act, being 775 ILCS
5/1-101 et seq., which currently defines sexual harassment as:
      (1)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors, or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual’s employment, either explicitly or implicitly;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute SEXUAL HARASSMENT includes, but is not
limited to:
         (a)   NON-VERBAL HARASSMENT. Suggestive or insulting sounds
(whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures,
“catcalls,” “smacking,” or “kissing” noises.
         (b)   PHYSICAL HARASSMENT. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, or any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (c)   VERBAL HARASSMENT. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments,
insults, humor, or jokes about: sex, anatomy, or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
         (d)   VISUAL. Posters, signs, pin-ups, or slogans of a sexual nature,
or viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (e)   TEXTUAL/ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT. “Sexting” (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking, and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages, and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of SEXUAL HARASSMENT are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some SEXUAL HARASSMENT is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess SEXUAL HARASSMENT by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020)
§ 31.47 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself
or himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident
(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her or his
position to the offending employee and her or his immediate supervisor. It is
not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the
report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following.
      (1)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her or his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with supervisory personnel.
         (a)   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the Village Manager or Administrator, or the chief elected official of
the municipality.
         (b)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      (3)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough, and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
      (4)   Allegations.
         (a)   1.   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected
official of the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental
unit. In addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected
official may request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment
by another elected official. The request shall be made to the Human Resources
Director, the Village Manager or Administrator, or the chief elected official
of the municipality.
            2.   The official receiving the request shall take immediate action
in keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a
qualified individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of
sexual harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent
review shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
         (b)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time, and the location), including, but
not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos, and telephone
messages.
         (c)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted
and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020)
§ 31.48 PROHIBITIONS ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee, or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee’s or official’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
      (2)   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into
any violation of this policy; or
      (3)   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For purposes of this policy, RETALIATORY ACTION means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion, or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee’s or official’s involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, agency, or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule,
or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, agency, or other employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   (E)   (1)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an
employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a
court, an administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee,
or in any other proceeding where the employee has reasonable cause to believe
that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation.
      (2)   In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the State Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he or she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the State Human
Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge within 300 days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020)
§ 31.49 CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks,
and/or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or
the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65 may be
subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable disciplinary actions
or discharge by the municipality, and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law, or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020) Penalty, see §
31.99
§ 31.50 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.
   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks, and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
(Ord. 20-05, passed 6-16-2020)
§ 31.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   The penalties for violations of §
31.01 shall be the same as those penalties set forth in 5 ILCS 430/50-5 for
similar violations of the Act.
   (C)   In addition to the prohibitions set forth in §§
31.45 through
31.50, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation
of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics
commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a state’s Attorney, the
Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to
$5,000 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous, or bad
faith allegation.

(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.07 AUDIT PROCEDURE.
   Not more than once every two years, the village may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer’s books and records. Any request for a proposed audit pursuant to any
locally imposed and administered tax shall comply with the notice requirements
of this subchapter.
   (A)   Information required. Each notice shall contain the following
information:
      (1)   The tax;
      (2)   The time period of the audit; and
      (3)   A brief description of the books and records to be made available
for the auditor, in the format maintained by the taxpayer in the ordinary
course of its business. The information that may be requested by the Local Tax
Administrator, or third party provider, includes:
         (a)   In an electronic format, used by the taxpayer in the ordinary
course of its business, the database used by the taxpayer to determine the
amount of tax due to the village; provided, however, that, if the village
requests customer-specific billing, usage, and load shape data from a taxpayer
that is an electric utility and has not provided the electric utility with the
customers’ verifiable authorization required by § 16-122 of the Public
Utilities Act, being 220 ILCS 5/16-122, then the electric utility shall remove
from the database all customer-specific billing, usage, and load shape data
before providing it to the village; and
         (b)   In a format used by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of its
business, summary data, as needed by the village, to determine the unit
consumption of utility services by providing the gross therms, kilowatts,
minutes, or other units of measurement being taxed within the village’s
jurisdiction and the gross revenues collected and the associated taxes
assessed.
      (4)   The identity of the village representative, or third party
provider, who will be conducting the audit, together with the written
authorization, if applicable.
      (5)   For audits to be conducted by third party providers, no contact may
be made by the third party provider until the Local Tax Administrator’s
authorization is received by the taxpayer.
   (B)   Time for conducting audit.
      (1)   The audit shall be conducted at a time selected by the Local Tax
Administrator, but in no event sooner than 60 days after the date of the notice
described in division (A) above; provided, that if the taxpayer notifies the
Local Tax Administrator within 30 days of receiving the notice that it is
cooperating with audits for three or more municipalities, or municipalities
with cumulatively more than 100,000 customers, the audit shall be conducted no
sooner than 90 days.
      (2)   Any audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, and if
the date and time selected by the Local Tax Administrator is not agreeable to
the taxpayer, another date and time may be requested by the taxpayer within 30
days after the originally designated audit and during normal business hours.
      (3)   The taxpayer may request an extension of time to have an audit
conducted. The audit shall be conducted not less than seven days nor more than
30 days from the date the notice is given, unless the taxpayer and the Local
Tax Administrator agree to some other convenient time. In the event the
taxpayer is unable to comply with the audit on the date in question, the
taxpayer may request another date within the 30 days, approved in writing, that
is convenient to the taxpayer and the Local Tax Administrator.
   (C)   Taxpayer’s books and records.
      (1)   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the
taxpayer’s business or activities, including original source documents and
books of entry denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given
rise to any tax liability, exemption, or deduction. All books shall be kept in
the English language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by
the village.
      (2)   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make
available his or her books and records for inspection by the village. If the
taxpayer (or tax collector) fails to provide the documents necessary for audit
within the time provided, the Local Tax Administrator may issue a tax
determination and assessment based on the Tax Administrator’s determination of
the best estimate of the taxpayer’s liability.
      (3)   The auditor or third party provider must sign a commercially
reasonable confidentiality agreement upon request by the taxpayer.
   (D)   Audit closure report. Upon the completion of the audit, the Local Tax
Administrator must issue an audit closure report to the taxpayer with the
results of the audit. If an underpayment is determined by the audit, the
taxpayer must submit a written response within 60 days after the date the audit
closure report was postmarked stating that it has corrected the error or
stating the reason that the error is inapplicable or inaccurate. The
municipality then has 60 days after the receipt of the taxpayer’s response to
review and contest the conclusion of the taxpayer. If the parties are unable to
agree on the disposition of the audit findings within 120 days after the
notification of the underpayment to the taxpayer, then either party may submit
the matter for appeal as outlined in §
32.08.
   (E)   Overpayments. If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of
a locally imposed and administered tax, written notice of the amount of
overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer by the Local Tax Administrator and
the auditor, if different, within 30 days of the village’s determination of the
amount of overpayment. The audit closure report may satisfy this requirement if
it is timely delivered.
   (F)   Payment to improper entity. In the event a tax payment was submitted
to the incorrect local governmental entity, the Local Tax Administrator shall
notify the local governmental entity imposing such tax.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.08 APPEALS.
   (A)   Contents of notice regarding taxes due. The Local Tax Administrator
shall send written notice to a taxpayer upon the Local Tax Administrator’s
issuance of a protestable notice of tax due, a bill, a claim denial, or a
notice of claim reduction regarding any tax. The notice shall include the
following information:
      (1)   The reason for the assessment;
      (2)   The amount of the tax liability proposed;
      (3)   The procedure for appealing the assessment; and
      (4)   The obligations of the village during the audit, appeal, refund,

   (B)   Request for hearing. The taxpayer who receives written notice from the
Local Tax Administrator of a determination of tax due or assessment, or the
village, may file with the Local Tax Administrator a written protest and
petition for hearing, setting forth the basis of the appellants request for a
hearing. The written protest and petition for hearing must be filed with the
Local Tax Administrator within 45 days of receipt of the written notice of the
tax determination and assessment or in the time otherwise required herein.
   (C)   Hearing scheduled; notice. If a timely written notice and petition for
hearing is filed, the Local Tax Administrator shall fix the time and place for
hearing and shall give written notice to the village and taxpayer. The hearing
shall be scheduled for a date within 14 days of receipt of the written protest
and petition for hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient
to all parties.
   (D)   Time limit for filing hearing request. If a written protest and
petition for hearing is not filed within the 45-day period, the tax
determination, audit, or assessment shall become a final bill, due and owing,
without further notice.
   (E)   Reopening, extension of hearing request. Upon the showing of
reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full payment of the contested tax
liability along with interest accrued as of the date of the tax, the Local Tax
Administrator may reopen or extend the time for filing a written protest and
petition for hearing. In no event shall the time for filing a written protest
and petition for hearing be reopened or extended for more than 90 days after
the expiration of the 45-day period.
   (F)   Conduct of hearing; decision.
      (1)   Whenever a taxpayer (or a tax collector) has filed a timely written
protest and petition for hearing under this section, the Local Tax
Administrator shall conduct a hearing regarding any appeal.
      (2)   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a
continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack
of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted
shall not exceed 14 days.
      (3)   At the hearing, the Local Tax Administrator shall preside and shall
hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax determination,
audit, or assessment. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial
proceedings shall not apply.
      (4)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Local Tax Administrator shall
make a written determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the
hearing. The taxpayer (or tax collector) shall be provided with a copy of the
written decision.
   (G)   Administrative review. If the appeals process does not produce a
satisfactory result, then either party may pursue the alleged error in a court
of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.09 PAYMENT REQUIRED; INTEREST, PENALTIES.
   (A)   Time for payment. In the event a determination has been made that a
tax is due and owing, through audit, assessment, or other bill sent, the tax
must be paid within the time frame otherwise indicated.
   (B)   Interest. The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be 5%
per annum, based on a year of 360 days and the number of days elapsed.
   (C)   Late filing and payment penalties. If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of 5% of the amount of tax required to be shown as due on a return
shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of 5% of the tax due shall be
imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided by the
controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village issuing a notice of tax
delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
   (D)   Abatement of penalties. The Local Tax Administrator shall have the
authority to waive or abate any late filing penalty, late payment penalty, or
failure to file penalty if the Local Tax Administrator shall determine
reasonable cause exists for delay or failure to make a filing.
   (E)   Error in past collections.
      (1)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no taxpayer is
liable for any error in past collections and payments that was unknown by it
prior to the audit process, unless:
         (a)   The error was due to negligence by the taxpayer in the
collection or processing of required date; and
         (b)   The village had not failed to respond in writing on an accurate
and timely basis to any written request of the taxpayer to review and correct
information used by the taxpayer to collect the village’s locally imposed and
administered tax if a diligent review of such information by the village
reasonably could have been expected to discover such error.
      (2)   If, however, an error in past collections or payments resulted in a
customer, who should not have owed a locally imposed and administered tax to
the village, having paid a tax to the village, then the customer may, to the
extent allowed by § 9-252 of the Public Utilities Act, being 220 ILCS 5/9-252,
recover the tax from the taxpayer, and any amount so paid by the taxpayer may
be deducted by that taxpayer from any taxes then or thereafter owed by the
taxpayer to the village.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.10 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The Local Tax
Administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
Local Tax Administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer
shall have 14 working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the 14 working-day period or fails to demonstrate
good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the Local Tax
Administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.11 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   The village, through the Local Tax Administrator, shall review all tax
returns in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due
and owing. The taxpayer shall have 45 days after receiving notice of the
reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.
   (B)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (C)   If any tax return is not filed or if, during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the village,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, or the end of the calendar year in which the
return for the applicable period was filed, whichever occurs later.
   (D)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.12 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with
the Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A
taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount
of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month for all periods prior to the
filing of the application, but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application.
   (B)   Except for the amount of tax and interest due under this section, a
taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for
any additional tax interest or penalty for any period before the date the
application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and
underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax
along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment
was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case, the
application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest
must be made no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure
application or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is
longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of
tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days
after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional
amount owed, or the date agreed to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is
longer.
(Ord. 10-7, passed 8-17-2010)
§ 32.13 REVIEW OF LIENS.
   The Local Tax Administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayer for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the Local Tax Administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the Local Tax Administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village’s expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

respect to any transaction in interstate commerce or otherwise to the extent to
which the business or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of
the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the state or any
political subdivision thereof; nor shall any persons engaged in the business of
distributing, supplying, furnishing, or selling or transmitting gas or

business in the state. Persons delivering the electricity shall collect the tax
from the purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the
electricity. Persons delivering the electricity shall also be authorized to add
to such gross charge in an amount equal to 3% of the tax to reimburse the
person delivering the electricity for the expense incurred in keeping records,
billing customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax, and
supplying data to the village upon request. If the person delivering the
electricity fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser
shall be required to pay the tax directly to the village in the manner
prescribed by the village. Persons delivering the electricity who file returns
pursuant to this division (D) shall, at the time of filing such return, pay the
village the amount of the tax collected pursuant to this section.

time of making such return, pay to the village the amount of tax herein
imposed; provided, that in connection with any return, the person may, if he or
she so elects, report and pay an amount based upon a reasonable estimate of the
total billings of business subject to the tax during the period for which the
return is made (exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt
adjustments of later payments based upon any differences between such billings,
and the taxable gross receipts or kilowatt-hour usage, as applicable.
   (F)   Credit for over-payment.
      (1)   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was

extent permitted in §§

(Ord. 10-1, passed 1-19-2010)
IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM; PROTECTION
§ 33.15 PROGRAM ADOPTION.
   The identity theft prevention program (“program”) was developed pursuant to
the Federal Trade Commission’s Red Flags Rules (“Rules”), which implement § 114
of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, 16 C.F.R. § 681.2,
being 15 U.S.C. § 1681m(e).
(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)
§ 33.16 PROGRAM PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Fulfilling requirements of the Red Flags Rules. Under the Red Flags
Rules, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an
identity theft prevention program tailored to its size, complexity, and the
nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and
procedures to:
      (1)   Identity relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those red flags into the program;
      (2)   Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
      (3)   Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate identity theft; and
      (4)   Ensure the program is updated periodically to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity
theft.
   (B)   Red Flags Rules definitions used in this program.
      (1)   The Red Flags Rules define IDENTITY THEFT as fraud committed using
the identifying information of another person and a RED FLAG as a pattern,
practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of
identity theft.
      (2)   The Red Flags Rules define CREDITORS to include finance companies,
automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications
companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer payment for goods or
services, they, too, are to be considered creditors.
      (3)   The village’s billing accounts maintained for the delivery of
services, including water and any other utility services, are covered by the
Rules. According to the Red Flag Rules, a COVERED ACCOUNT is:
         (a)   Any account the village offers or maintains primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or
transactions; and
         (b)   Any other account the village offers or maintains for which
there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and
soundness of the village from identity theft, including small business and sole
proprietorship accounts.
      (4)   IDENTITY INFORMATION is defined under the Rule as any name or
number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to
identify a specific person, including: name, address, telephone number, Social
Security number, date of birth, government issued driver’s license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification
number, computer’s internet protocol address, or routing code.
(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)
§ 33.17 IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.
   In order to identify relevant red flags, the village considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with identity theft. The village identifies the following red
flags, in each of the listed categories.
   (A)   Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies red flags.
Notifications and warnings from credit reporting red flags shall be for the
following reasons:
      (1)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      (2)   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
      (3)   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for
an applicant; and
      (4)   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer’s usual pattern or activity.
   (B)   Suspicious documents red flags. Suspicious documents red flags are as
follows:
      (1)   Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered,
or inauthentic;
      (2)   Identification document or card on which a person’s photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      (3)   Other documents with information that is not consistent with
existing customer information (such as if a person’s signature on a check
appears forged); and
      (4)   Application for service that appears to have been altered or
forged.
   (C)   Suspicious personal identifying information red flags. Suspicious
personal identifying information red flags shall include:
      (1)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
information the customer provides (for example, inconsistent birth dates);
      (2)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a
credit report);
      (3)   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      (4)   Identifying information presented that is consistent with
fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address);
      (5)   A Social Security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      (6)   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      (7)   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law, Social Security
numbers must not be required); and
      (8)   If a person’s identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   (D)   Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account red flags.
Suspicious account activity or unusual use of an account red flags includes:

the account holder’s name;
      (2)   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account;
      (3)   An account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use (for
example, very high activity);
      (4)   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
      (5)   Notice to the village that a customer is not receiving mail sent by
the village;
      (6)   Notice to the village that an account has unauthorized activity;
      (7)   A breach in the village’s computer system security; and
      (8)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (E)   Alerts from others red flags. Notice to the village from a customer,
identity theft victim, law enforcement, or other person that it has opened or
is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft.
(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)
§ 33.18 DETECTING RED FLAGS.
   (A)   New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above
associated with the opening of a new account, village personnel will take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      (1)   Require certain identifying information, such as name, date of
birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an
entity, driver’s license, or other identification;

and
      (4)   Independently contact the customer.

(in person, via telephone, via facsimile, or via email);
      (2)   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      (3)   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes.
(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)

   In the event village personnel detect any identified red flags, such
personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the
degree of risk posed by the red flag.

(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)
§ 33.20 PROGRAM UPDATES.
   This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in
risks to customers and the security of village accounts. On an annual basis,
the Program Administrator will consider the village’s experiences with identity
theft prevention, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft
detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the village
maintains, and changes in the village’s business arrangements with other
entities. After considering these factors, the Program Administrator will
determine whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags,
are warranted. If warranted, the Program Administrator will update the program
or present recommended program changes to the Board of Trustees, which will
make a determination of whether to accept, modify, or reject such changes.
(Res. 09-R-1, passed 4-21-2009)

comprise the remainder of the Committee. The Program Administrator will be
responsible for oversight and administration of the program, for ensuring
appropriate training of village staff on the program, for reviewing any staff

(Ord. passed 1-16-1979)
§ 50.22 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.
   (A)   Industrial cost recovery required.
      (1)   Each industrial user shall pay the portion of any state grant which
has been obtained by the village for the financing of the construction of
wastewater treatment works allocable to the treatment of the wastewater from
such user. Such user’s share shall not include an interest component.
      (2)   Each year during the industrial cost recovery period, each
industrial user of the treatment works shall pay the cost recovery amount
determined by divisions (B) or (C) below for such industry, divided by the
recovery period.
      (3)   Where an industry is connected to a public sewer after the startup
of the facilities constructed under a state grant, such industry shall only pay
its portion of the state grant for each quarter remaining in the recovery
period. Such industry will not be required to pay for those quarters of the
recovery period prior to connection to a public sewer.
   (B)   Industrial cost recovery charge. The charge for industrial cost
recovery shall be based on a charge per unit volume of normal strength process
flow. Normal strength flow shall be waste strength less than or equal to 200
mg/l BOD and 250 mg/l suspended solids. The industrial cost recovery charge
will be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the state grant amount allocable to those treatment units
used to process dry weather sewage flow (which includes industrial waste
flows);
      (2)   Divide the allocable state grant amount by the industrial cost
recovery period;
      (3)   Determine the average annual design flow volume by multiplying the
daily design flow average of 128,000 gallons a day by 365 days a year (the
result is 46.7 million gallons per year);
      (4)   Divide the annual allocable grant amount determined in division (B)
(2) above by the average annual design flow volume of 46.7 million gallons; and
      (5)   The resulting charge of $0.26 per 1,000 gallons will be charged all
industrial users having a process waste flow.
   (C)   Total charge to an industrial user.
      (1)   The total industrial cost recovery charge for each billing period
shall be determined by multiplying a user’s industrial process flow volume
discharged during the billing period by $0.26 per 1,000 gallons.
      (2)   Industrial process flow volume shall be determined by measurement
or estimation of all water flow through industrial plant processes. In absence
of meter readings, process flow shall be estimated by using the following
formula:
         (a)   PF = TWF - DF - CF, where:
            1.   PF is the process flow for the billing period;
            2.   TWF is the total water flow for billing period from meter
reading, plus estimates of flows from private wells, if any;
            3.   DF is the domestic flow from employees estimated by
multiplying the average number of man-shifts worked for the billing period by
an allowance of 25 gallons per man-shift worked; and
            4.   CF is the flow consumed or otherwise not returned to the
sewer.
         (b)   If, in the opinion of the Village Clerk, the village’s interest
would be served by making the above estimation on an annual basis, then the
Clerk may elect to negotiate with each industry a percentage of the total water
flow to estimate process flows each billing period.
   (D)   Length of industrial cost recovery period. The industrial cost
recovery period shall be equal to the useful life of the treatment works, which
shall be 30 years from 1978, not to exceed 30 years.
   (E)   Payments and billing for industrial cost recovery period. Industrial
cost recovery charges to industrial users shall be included with the regular
billing for sewer use charges as specified in this section.
   (F)   Adjustment of charge due to introduction of high strength industrial
waste discharges. If, at any time, during the industrial cost recovery period
an industry begins discharging wastes with strengths greater than 200 mg/l BOD
and 250 mg/l suspended solids, a study shall be made under the direction of the
Village Board to revise the industrial cost recovery charge to include a high
waste strength surcharge as well as a process flow volume charge. The revised
charge factors shall be applied to process flow volume and measured waste
strength quantities in excess of normal.
   (G)   Adjustment of charge due to plant improvement utilizing state grant
funds. If there is an expansion or upgrading of the treatment works utilizing a
State grant, each existing industrial user’s share shall be adjusted
accordingly.
   (H)   No charge for unused or unreserved capacity. An industrial user’s
portion of any state grant shall not include any portion of the grant amount
allocable to unused or reserved capacity.
   (I)   Commitment for increased use. An industrial user’s portion of any
state grant shall include allowance for the cost of any firm commitment to the
village for any increased use by such user.
   (J)   Payment to the state required. The village shall retain 50% of the
amounts recovered from industrial users. The remainder, together with any
interest earned thereon, shall be returned to the State Anti-Pollution Fund on
an annual basis.
   (K)   Disposition of retained amounts.
      (1)   Eighty percent of the retained amounts, together with interest
earned thereon, shall be used solely for the eligible costs of the expansion or
reconstruct: of treatment works associated with the project and necessary to
meet the requirements of the federal Act and the state.
      (2)   The village, prior to commitment of the retained amounts, shall
obtain written approval of the State Environmental Protection Agency for an
expansion or reconstruction. The remainder of the retained amount may be used
for such expenditures as the village deems appropriate.
   (L)   Investment of retained amounts required. Pending use, the grantee
shall invest the retained amounts for reconstruction and expansion in:
      (1)   Obligations of the U.S. Government;
      (2)   Obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government or any agency thereof; or
      (3)   Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. Government, or any agency thereof.
   (M)   Village Clerk’s responsibility. The Village Clerk shall maintain the
necessary records for determination of user share of the cost, and shall
provide the billing and collection services as required by
51.17(A).
   (N)   Village Treasurer’s responsibility. The Village Treasurer shall be
responsible for the investment and expenditure of all moneys collected for
industrial cost recovery.
   (O)   Monitoring required. The Sewage Plant Superintendent shall maintain a
program of monitoring industrial user discharges as the Village Board deems
necessary, provided that any major contributing industry shall be monitored no
less than 12 times annually.

§ 51.33 SUPERINTENDENT OF WATER.
   (A)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Water to cause surveys
and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply to determine whether actual or potential hazards to the
public water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a
matter of public record and shall be repeated at least every two years, or as
often as the Superintendent of Water shall deem necessary. Records of such
surveys shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at least
five years.
   (B)   The Superintendent of Water of the village is hereby authorized and
directed to discontinue, the water service to any property where in any
connection in violation of the provisions of this subchapter is known to exist,
and to take such other precautionary measures as he or she may deem necessary
to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water supply
distribution mains. When there is no imminent danger of harmful contamination
of the public water supply the Superintendent of Water shall, prior to
disconnection of water service, give the customer notice of the improper cross-
connection and provide an opportunity for the customer to contest the decision
to terminate water service. Water service to such property shall not be
restored until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this subchapter, and until a reconnection fee of $50 is
paid to the village. Immediate disconnection with verbal notice or posting on
the property can be effected when the Superintendent of Water is assured that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection, and an opportunity for the customer to contest the decision to
terminate water service. In an emergency situation immediate disconnection can
be effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided, that in the reasonable opinion of the
Superintendent of Water or the State Environmental Protection Agency, such
action is required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution of
the public water supply and reasonable attempts have been made to provide
verbal notice to the customer, and the property has been posted. In an
emergency situation where water service has been disconnected without actual
notice, the Superintendent of Water shall give prompt post termination notice
to the customer and provide a prompt opportunity for the customer to contest
the decision to terminate water service. Neither the village nor the
Superintendent of Water, nor their agents or assigns, shall be liable to any
customer for any injury, damages, or lost revenues which may result from
termination of said customer’s water supply in accordance with the terms of
this subchapter, whether or not said termination was with or without notice.

Superintendent, or his or her authorized agent, shall have the right to enter
at any reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water
supply or distribution system of the village for the purpose of verifying
information submitted by the customer regarding the required cross-connection
control inspection. On demand, the owner, lessees, or occupants of any property
so served shall furnish to the Superintendent of Water any information which he
or she may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Superintendent of Water, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this subchapter.

(Ord. passed 1-16-1979)
§ 52.04 WASTEWATER USER CHARGES.
   (A)   Basis for wastewater user charges.
      (1)   The wastewater user charge for the use of and for service supplied
by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user
charge for operation and maintenance, plus replacement and a surcharge, if
applicable. It shall apply to users of either the existing combined sewer
system or the new sanitary system.
      (2)   The user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters for normal waste having the following strengths:
         (a)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l;
and
         (b)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
      (3)   Water meter readings shall be assumed to equal sewage flow except
in cases where the user may show adequate proof that water passed through the
meter is not returned to the sewer. An adjustment in meter readings will be
made in such cases if the user furnishes the village a reasonable estimate or
meter readings of water flow not discharged to the sewer.
      (4)   The user charge shall consist of operation and maintenance costs
plus replacement, and shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year
and the debt service requirements;
         (b)   Estimate wastewater volume discharged to the sewer system based
on total water meter readings after appropriate adjustment for water not
returned to the sewer and/or water from unmetered private sources which is
discharged to the sewer system; and
         (c)   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength
wastes.
      (5)   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the
normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). The surcharge will
be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for
all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/l concentration for BOD and SS,
respectively.
      (6)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed
annually by certified public accountants for the village in their annual audit
report. The wastewater user charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a
change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs and
adjusted as required. One of the purposes of the annual review shall be to
maintain service charges in relation to cost and assure that all use classes
are being charged an equitable share.
   (B)   Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing user
charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the
lowest even increments of 100 gallons.
      (1)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part or all of his or her water from sources other than the village water
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from these other sources.
      (2)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged to the
sanitary sewer may be required by the Village Board if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (3)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste not discharged to the
sanitary sewer may be required by the Village Board if reasonable estimates
cannot be made for adjusting water meter readings.
      (4)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the Village Board.
   (C)   User rate. There shall be and there is hereby established a minimum
charge and a basic user rate for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the village.
      (1)   A minimum charge of $8 per one-month period to all users whose
water consumption does not exceed 1,000 gallons per one-month period, and for
all users who discharge normal strength waste to system.
      (2)   All over 1,000 gallons: $2.95 per 1,000 gallons or fraction
thereof.
   (D)   Surcharge rate. For waste strengths above normal strength of 200 mg/
l BOD and 250 mg/l SS, a surcharge of $0.18 per pound BOD and $0.06 per ounce
SS shall be applied. The surcharge for each bi-monthly period shall be computed
by the following formulae:
      (1)   SCBOD = (x-200) x A x 0.0000083 x $0.18; and
      (2)   SCSS = (y-250) x A x 0.0000083 x $0.06, where:
         (a)   SCBOD is the surcharge above the basic user rate for BOD
concentration above 200 mg/l;
         (b)   SCSS is the surcharge above the basic user rate for SS
concentration above 250 mg/l;
         (c)   x is the average BOD concentration in mg/l;
         (d)   y is the average SS concentration in mg/l; and
         (e)   A is the bimonthly metered water flow adjusted for appropriate
losses in gallons.
   (E)   Computation of surcharge.
      (1)   The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling.
      (2)   Waste sampling shall be performed as often as may be deemed
necessary by the Village Board and shall be binding a basis for surcharges.
   (F)   Computation of total wastewater user charge. The wastewater user
charge shall be computed by the following formula: CW = MC + BC + SCBOD + SCSS,
where:
      (1)   CW is the total wastewater user charge;
      (2)   MC is minimum charge as set out in division (C) above;
      (3)   BC is the basic user charge as set out in division (C) above;
      (4)   BOD is the surcharge for BOD as computed in division (D)(1) above;
and
      (5)   SCSS is the surcharge for SS as computed in division (D)(1) above.

§ 71.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is adopted in the interest of public safety. This chapter is
not to be relied upon as a determination that the operation of golf carts, all-

including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. All
persons who operate or ride on such vehicles on streets within the village do
so at their own risk and peril. The village has no liability under any theory
of law for permitting golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, and non-highway
vehicles to be operated on village streets.

During the appeal process, the revocation shall remain in full force and
effect.
   (F)   In the event a registration is revoked due to a failure to maintain
the required liability insurance or a failure to maintain the condition of the
recreational non-highway vehicle in compliance with this subchapter, including,
but not limited to, maintaining the required safety systems, the village, in
its discretion, may reinstate the registration upon documentation of
reinstatement of the required insurance or of the repair of modification of the
vehicle necessary to cure any deficiencies, as applicable, if the village

to foreclose on the lien.
      (9)   Sixty calendar days after abatement, if there is no payment for the
costs to the village to abate nuisance, the village may record a lien.
      (10)   If the lien is not satisfied, after a period of time left to the
Board, legal action may be authorized to foreclose on the lien.

(Ord. 2016-11, passed 12-20-2016)
§ 90.47 ABATEMENT; CHARGES.

describes the parcel;

lien has been filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the
village or person in whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall
be recorded of record in the same manner as recording the notice of a lien.
         (c)   Foreclosure of lien.
            1.   Subsequent to the filing of the above-described lien, the
village may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure of such a lien, or
upon becoming a defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the premises or real
estate, by answer to the complaint, or in the nature of an intervening petition
or cross-complaint, the village may proceed in its corporate name to foreclose
such a lien.
            2.   An action to foreclose a lien under this section must be

lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in the county in which the real
estate is located. The notice of a lien shall be filed within one year after
the cost and expense is incurred.
            2.   If, for any one property, the village engaged in any nuisance
abatement activity described in division (A) above on more than one occasion
during the course of one year, then the village may combine any or all of the
costs of those activities into a single notice of a lien. The notice of a lien
shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
               a.   A description of the abandoned residential property that
sufficiently describes the parcel;
               b.   The amount of the cost incurred or payable for the
activities;
               c.   The date or dates when such cost was incurred by the
village, or someone working on behalf of the village; and

notice to the village that the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial
actions; provided, however, that the remedial actions must be performed or
initiated in good faith within 30 days of the lender’s notice to the village.
         (b)   Recordkeeping. To enforce a lien pursuant to this division (B),

or, if known, any agent of the owner;
            5.   A dated certification by a village official of the necessity
and specific nature of the work performed;

(Documents, “Declaration of Vacant Building,” “Required Maintenance Work for
Vacant Building,” “Appeal of Vacant Building”)
§ 90.49 VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Findings and intent.
      (1)   The Village Board of Trustees finds that vacant buildings have
caused significant problems for the village including, but not limited to,
frozen pipes, leaks in waterlines and utilities, building becoming dilapidated
and unsafe, and the building becoming attractive nuisances, and negative
impacts on nearby property values. The Village Board of Trustees finds that
boarded-up windows and doors should only be a temporary solution to prevent
unauthorized entry into a building. The Village Board of Trustees finds that
windows and doors boarded up for an extended time negatively impact the
property values and serve as a notice that the building is vacant.
      (2)   This section intends to protect the public health safety and
welfare by:
         (a)   Establishing a program for identification registration and
maintenance of buildings that are or become vacant on and after the effective
date of this section;
         (b)   Determining the responsibilities of the owners of record of
vacant buildings; and
         (c)   Providing for additional means of avoidance and abatement of
public nuisances.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates, or requires, a
different meaning.
      OWNER. Any person, agent, operator, partnership, corporation, or entity
having a legal or equitable interest in a vacant building; or recorded in the
official records of the state, county, or municipality as holding title to the
same; or otherwise having control of the same, including the guardian of the
estate of any such person, and the executor or administrator of the estate or a
mortgage holder in possession of a mortgage holder after the entry of an order
for foreclosure and sale.
      VACANT BUILDING.
         (a)   A building with one or more of the following conditions:
            1.   A building or portion thereof which lacks the habitual
presence of human beings who have a legal right to be on the premises;
            2.   A building within which substantially all lawful residential
or business activity has ceased;
            3.   A building substantially devoid of contents;
            4.   A building that lacks active utility services such as water,

            6.   A building without functioning doors or windows or with
boarded-up doors or windows;
            7.   A building subject to a mortgage foreclosure action for one
year or longer, or held by a lender following a foreclosure action for one year
or longer; and/or
            8.   A building located on a property that shows signs of a lack of
any regular maintenance with the presence of nuisance greenery.
         (b)   A VACANT BUILDING does not include a building:
            1.   That is listed for sale, provided the buildings have not been
listed for sale for more than six consecutive months within the past 24 months;
            2.   That is listed for rent, provided the property has not been
listed for rent for more than six months within the past 24 months; and
            3.   That is subject to an active building permit, provided the
building permit has not been in effect for more than six months, and provided
the total of all building permits for the property has not exceeded six months
within the last 24 months.
   (C)   Declaration of vacant buildings.
      (1)   The Zoning Committee, or its designee, shall determine in writing
if a building is vacant. A copy of such a written determination shall be sent
to the person designated by the county as receiving the real estate tax bill
regarding said premises. The written determination shall be sent by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or by personal or substitute service, and
posted on a conspicuous location on the building. Proof of mailing shall be
prima facie evidence of receipt of the notice. The written determination shall
include the following:
         (a)   The street address of the building or a description sufficient
for identification;
         (b)   A statement requiring the proper owner to register the building
with the Office Administrator within 30 days of the mailing of the notice;
         (c)   A statement identifying any maintenance work required for the
building;
         (d)   A vacant building registration form; and
         (e)   A form to be completed to appeal the determination that the
property is vacant.
      (2)   (a)   An appeal of the declaration finding a building vacant may be
made to the Board of Trustees. The appeal must be made in writing and shall be
filed with the Office Administrator within 30 days of the date of mailing,
service, or posting of the notice of declaration.
         (b)   The appeal shall contain a complete statement of the reasons the
owner disputes the declaration, shall set forth specific facts in support
thereof, shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to support the
appeal, and shall provide means for making immediate contact with the owner.
The filing of an appeal states the owner’s obligation to register the building.
         (c)   The Office Administrator shall set the matter for hearing before
the Board of Trustees and provide at least ten days’ written notice to the
owner of the date of said hearing. The burden is upon the owner to present
sufficient evidence to show that the building is not vacant. The Board of
Trustees shall decide the appeal after a hearing. If the owner is not present
at the hearing, the Office Administrator shall send written notice of the
decision to the owner within ten days after the hearing.
   (D)   Registration of vacant buildings.
      (1)   Whenever any building is declared vacant, the owner of such

a vacant building registration and pay the vacant building registration fee.
The form shall include, as a minimum:
         (a)   The names of all owners, which shall include the principals of
any partnership, corporation, trust, or other entity, and their contact
information, include mailing address, telephone number, and/or email, including
contact information for emergency purposes. A post office box is not an
acceptable address;

affecting the vacant building, including bankruptcy cases; and the name, street
address, email address, and telephone number of all persons with any legal
interest in the vacant building or the premises;

licensed realtor or other means for listing the property for sale.

registration annually.
      (3)   The initial registration fee for a building shall be $750. The
building shall be re-registered every six months after the initial
registration. The registration fee for each subsequent renewal after the first
shall be set at $750.
      (4)   An amended registration form shall be filed within 30 days of any
change of information provided on the registration form or if the owner
requests that the building no longer be declared vacant. The burden is on the
owner to illustrate that the building is no longer vacant. There is no charge
to amend the owner’s registration information or to request a village finding
that the building is no longer vacant.
      (5)   Registration does not exonerate the owner from compliance with all
applicable codes and ordinances adopted by the village, including this section
or found elsewhere in the Board of Trustees.

building shall maintain such building to comply with the following minimum

the side yard setback area for your lot.
 
   10.)   Separate permits are required for new construction of barrier/fences.
Temporary fences and/or barriers will not meet the fencing/barrier requirements.
What do I need to submit in order to register my temporary/seasonal pool?
 
Along with a completed Pool Registration form, please provide a site plan or plat of
survey showing the approximate placement of the pool. Also, if you are renting the
property, please submit a letter from the property owner granting permission for pool
installation on the property, in addition to the other items required.
 
Is there a fee to register my pool?
 
Yes, there is a required fee of $35 to register a permanent pool or spa in the

$5.
 
Are there benefits to registering my pool?
 
Yes, along with the required registration your water/sewer account will receive a
credit equal to the total size (in gallons) of your registered pool or spa. When
calculating a homeowner’s credit amount, a rate of $2.95 for every 1,000 gallons, or
fraction thereof, shall be used.
 
Do I need an inspection of my pool?
 
The Village of Flanagan will complete a brief scheduled inspection of the property to
confirm the existence of the barrier/fence (if required). The property owner/
resident/applicant doesn’t need to be home for this inspection. If there is an issue
with the barrier or with your pool registration, you will be notified by the Village
of Flanagan.
 
Do I need to contact or get approval from any other agencies?
 
Other agencies which may have an interest in your pool installation include utility
companies, such as natural gas, cable, telephone, and electrical, due to the presence
and maintenance of easements. In addition, subdivision homeowner’s associations
(HOA’s) may prohibit or require architectural reviews, approvals, or increased
setbacks for pools depending upon what is written in the HOA’s Covenants and
Restrictions. If your subdivision has an Association, it’s always a good idea to
check with the association prior to the installation of anything on your property.

wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
   (B)   Application process. The village shall process applications as
follows.
      (1)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
      (2)   (a)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
         (b)   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
         (c)   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed-approved notice by the village. The receipt of
the deemed-approved notice shall not preclude the village’s denial of the
permit request within the time limits as provided under this subchapter.
      (3)   (a)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or

conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
         (c)   The village shall document the basis for a denial, including the
specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
village denies an application.
         (d)   1.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the

fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
            2.   Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of
denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable
fees, and recommencement of the village’s review period.

      (1)   Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village shall
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to
provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents,
information, and fees specifically enumerated in the village’s permit
application form are submitted by the applicant to the village.
      (2)   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the
notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
   (D)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
      (1)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the village;
or
      (2)   A local, state, or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.

wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at
the applicant’s discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the
collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless
facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the village may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
   (F)   Duration of permits.
      (1)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or
modified utility pole does not comply with the applicable village codes or any
provision, condition, or requirement contained in this chapter.

with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   (K)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply
with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance, and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility

utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after the issuance of the
permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an
