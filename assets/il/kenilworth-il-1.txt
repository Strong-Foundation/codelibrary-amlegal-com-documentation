PREFACE
   HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE VILLAGE
   The Village of Kenilworth was founded in 1890 by Mr. Joseph Sears to provide
suburban home sites with city conveniences. The name “Kenilworth” and the names
of most of the original streets in the village, were taken from Sir Walter
Scott’s novel, Kenilworth.
   Mr. Joseph Sears guarded the early development of the village by subdividing
the area into large lots and by inserting rigid restrictions in all deeds, many
of which restrictions have since been incorporated in the Kenilworth zoning
regulations. All village functions were carried on by the Kenilworth Company,
which Mr. Sears controlled, until February 4, 1896, when the community was
incorporated as a village. At that time the village was confined to the area
east of the Chicago and North Western Railway. The portion of Kenilworth west
of the railway was annexed to the village in 1920 to prevent it from possible
industrial and commercial use, and with the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance in
1923, it has developed into one of the finest residential neighborhoods on the
North Shore.
   The Village Manager plan of government was adopted in 1920, and the village
has continuously operated under that plan since, enabling the village to
gratuitously receive the benefit of high qualified people to serve as its
officers and trustees.
   The water supply system, previously under private ownership, was purchased
by the village in 1925, and a modern pumping and filtering plant was completed
in 1928 and has since been substantially increased in capacity. Prior to 1929,
fire protection was furnished by a local volunteer fire department. Commencing
in 1929, fire protection has been furnished by contract with the Fire
Department of the adjoining Village of Winnetka. The Police Department has
increased from one chief, one patrol officer and one police officer for night
duty in 1921, to its present force. Equipped with motorized equipment and a
modern two-way radio system interconnected with adjoining North Shore Villages,
it is one of the best Police Departments for its size in the Chicago area.
   Today the Village of Kenilworth is recognized as one of the finest
residential communities in the country.

   (A)   Penalties. Whenever in this code or in any ordinance of the village
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or
whenever in this code or any ordinance the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
provided therefor, any person upon conviction for the violation of any
provision of this code or any ordinance shall be punished by a fine of not less
than $1 nor exceeding $750 for each offense. Each day any violation of any
provision of this code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a
separate offense. In the construction and interpretation of this section, the
revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered as a recovery or
penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced. No provision of this
code designating the duties of any village officer or employee shall be
construed as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine or penalty
provided in this code for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention
of the board of trustees to impose such a fine or penalty on such officer or
employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the
duty.
   (B)   Procedure for out-of-court settlement. Every person who is cited for
an alleged violation of any provision of this code may resolve each citation by
out-of-court settlement with the village in accordance with the following
procedure.
      (1)   Each alleged violator shall, at the time he or she is first served
with the citation, be given information in writing explaining the out-of-court
settlement option hereunder.
      (2)   The settlement may be accomplished by the alleged violator paying
to the village a specified out-of-court settlement amount within ten days after
the date of the citation. The amount of the out-of-court settlement shall be
indicated on the citation.
      (3)   The payment may be made either in person at the Village Hall, in
which case a receipt shall be issued upon payment, by mail or other method
authorized by the village. In the case of payment by mail, the out-of-court
settlement payment must be actually received within ten days after the date of
the citation, and no receipt shall be issued.
      (4)   If an out-of-court settlement payment is not made within ten days
after the date of the citation as specified in subsection (B)(3) above, the
alleged violator shall have the option, for an additional ten days thereafter,
to resolve the citation with the village by the payment of a late out-of-court
settlement amount indicated on the citation. Payment of the late out-of-court
settlement amount indicated in the citation may be made after the tenth day
through and including the twentieth day after the date the citation was issued
either in person at the Village Hall, in which case a receipt shall be issued
upon payment, or by mail, in which case no receipt shall be issued. In the case
of payment by mail, the late out-of-court settlement payment must be actually
received by the village within 20 days after the date of the citation or notice
violation.

of the county.

it, pursue the original citation by all appropriate means, including, but not
limited to, filing a complaint in the Circuit Court of the county.

subdivision thereof; nor shall any persons engaged in the business of
distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling or transmitting gas, water or
electricity, or engaged in the business of transmitting messages, or using or
consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail, be subject to taxation
under the provisions of this subchapter for those transactions that are or may
become subject to taxation under the provisions of the Municipal Retailers’
Occupation Tax Act as authorized by 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; nor shall any tax
authorized by this subchapter be imposed upon any person engaged in a business
or on any privilege unless the tax is imposed in like manner and at the same
rate or rates upon all persons engaged in businesses of the same class in the
village, whether privately or municipally owned or operated, or exercising the
same privilege within the village.
(Ord. 844, passed 2-8-1999; Ord. 850, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 35.04 ADDITIONAL TAXES.
   The tax imposed by this subchapter shall be in addition to other taxes

§ 35.05 COLLECTION.
   The tax imposed by this subchapter shall be collected from the purchaser by
the person maintaining a place of business in the state who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to this subchapter and
any tax collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt
owed to the village by the person delivering the electricity. Persons
delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding the
tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity; provided that the
person delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit for the tax related to
deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible, and provided further, that if the charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit the tax. Persons
delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to the gross charge an
amount equal to 3% of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity
for the expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and
filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the village upon
request. If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
village in the manner prescribed by the village. A person delivering
electricity who files a return pursuant to this section shall, at the time of
filing the return, pay the village the amount of the tax collected pursuant to
this subchapter.
(Ord. 844, passed 2-8-1999; Ord. 850, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 35.06 REPORTS TO VILLAGE.
   (A)   Every person required to collect and remit the tax imposed by this
subchapter shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form prescribed by the
Village Treasurer. The return and the accompanying remittance shall be due on
or before the last day of the month following the month during which the tax is
collected or is required to be collected under §
35.05.
   (B)   On or before the last day of each month, each taxpayer who has not
paid the tax imposed by this subchapter to a person delivering electricity as
set forth in §
35.05 and who is not otherwise exempted from paying the tax shall file a return
in the form prescribed by the Village Treasurer.
   (C)   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the time
of making the return, pay to the village the amount of tax herein imposed;
provided that in connection with any return, the taxpayer may, if he or she so
elects, report and pay an amount based upon his or her total billings of
business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later
payments based upon any differences between the billings and the taxable gross
receipts.
(Ord. 844, passed 2-8-1999; Ord. 850, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 35.07 RESALES.
   (A)   Electricity that is delivered to a person in the village shall be
considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person
receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the Village
Treasurer and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the electricity,
and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially
nontaxable as a sale for resale.
   (B)   If a person who receives electricity in the village claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Village
Treasurer for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts showing why it
is not liable for the tax imposed by this subchapter on any purchases of
electricity and shall furnish additional information as the Village Treasurer
may reasonably require.
   (C)   Upon approval of the application, the Village Treasurer shall assign a
resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant.
   (D)   The Village Treasurer may cancel the resale number of any person if
the person fails to pay any tax payable under this subchapter for electricity
used or consumed by the person, or if the number:
      (1)   Was obtained through misrepre- sentation; or
      (2)   Is no longer necessary because the person has discontinued making
resales.
   (E)   If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption
and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this
subchapter directly to the Village Treasurer on the amount of electricity that
the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect and remit the tax on the
amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.
   (F)   Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active
resale number and complying with all other conditions of this section shall be
excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity
delivered to the reseller, provided that the person reports to the Village
Treasurer the total amount of electricity delivered to the reseller, and any
other information that the Village Treasurer may reasonably require.
(Ord. 844, passed 2-8-1999; Ord. 850, passed 4-12-1999)

this subchapter shall keep accurate books and records of its business or
activity, including contemporaneous books and records denoting the transactions
that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability under this
subchapter. The books and records shall be subject to and available for
inspection at all times during business hours of the day.
(Ord. 844, passed 2-8-1999; Ord. 850, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 35.09 CREDIT FOR OVER-PAYMENT.
   (A)   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not
due under the provisions of this subchapter, whether as the result of a mistake
of fact or an error of law, then the amount shall be credited against any tax
due, or to become due, under this subchapter from the taxpayer who made the
erroneous payment. No person shall be entitled to a refund of, or a credit for,
a tax imposed under this subchapter unless the person files a claim for refund
or credit within one year after the date on which the tax was paid or remitted.
   (B)   In the absence of fraud or willful violation of this subchapter, no
action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this subchapter
shall be commenced more than three years after the due date of the amount.

   (A)   A tax is hereby imposed, pursuant to the provisions of §§ 5-10 and 5-
20 of the Act, upon the act or privilege of originating in the village or
receiving in the village intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of

retailer, in lieu of the rate of tax that would otherwise be imposed pursuant
to §§ 5-25 and 5-30 of the Act. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of
the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality
on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or
authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due
and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other municipal tax.
   (B)   A tax is hereby imposed, pursuant to the provisions of §§ 5-10 and 5-
20 of the Act, upon the act or privilege of originating in the village or
receiving in the village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of

retailer, in lieu of the rate of tax that would otherwise be imposed pursuant

credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the
extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in another state or the
tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this state which was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this
state.

acts or privileges to the extent the acts or privileges may not, under the
Constitution and statutes of the United States or the Act or statutes of this
state, be made the subject of taxation by the village.
(Ord. 943, passed 9-12-2005)
§ 35.22 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (A)   The tax imposed by this subchapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by the retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this subchapter and any tax collected by the
retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax imposed by this subchapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for the sale at
retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the
manner provided by the Department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax imposed by this subchapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.

information as required by the Department pursuant to § 5-50 of the Act and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the Department to implement that
Act.

§ 35.24 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of those telecommunications, the person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts which will show
the Department why the applicant is not liable for the tax imposed by this
subchapter on any of the purchases and shall furnish additional information as
the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive the telecommunication tax-free when the
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to that
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.
(Ord. 943, passed 9-12-2005)
§ 35.25 SURCHARGE IMPOSED.
   A surcharge is hereby imposed upon the monthly billed subscribers of
telecommunications carriers residing within the village for funding of the 9-1-

   Water shall not be furnished to a new tenant or non-owner until he or she
makes a cash deposit with the Village Clerk in an amount as established in the
annual fee ordinance to cover the value of the meter furnished, and a further
sum of an amount as established in the annual fee ordinance as a guarantee that
water bills rendered will be paid. The Village Manager is hereby authorized to
increase the amount of the deposit where the consumption of water exceeds, or
it is estimated that the amount of water may exceed, the consumption of water
during any billing period.

   All water supplied by the village shall be measured through meters of the
kind designated or approved by the Village Board, and all water passing through
a meter shall be charged for, whether used or wasted through defective pipes,
fixtures or otherwise. If any meter ceases to register, stops or is otherwise
out of repair, and fails to correctly indicate the water consumed, the Director
of Public Works shall estimate from the most reliable data available the
quantity of water passing through the meter during the failure and the bill so
estimated must be paid by the consumer. All meters shall be installed at the
expense of the property served. The Village Board shall, by resolution,
establish and amend, from time to time, a written list of charges for
installation of new and replacement water meters.

§ 50.08 WATER BILLS, WHEN DUE AND PAYABLE; FAILURE TO PAY PENALTIES.
   (A)   Water meters shall be read every four months at times as shall be
determined by the Village Water Department and bills for water furnished during
each four-month meter reading period preceding the date of billing shall be
rendered and be due and payable within 30 days after the date of the billing.
   (B)   The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the
water service (collectively referred to as “consumer” for purposes of this
section) shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the charges of the
village for water service to the premises. Any person responsible for the
payment of any water service charges imposed by the village who shall fail to
pay the charges when due shall be responsible for payment of the costs incurred
by the village, including the fees and costs of any attorney and/or collection
agency retained by the village for the purpose of seeking collection of the
charges, whether or not suit is instituted, in addition to all other fees,
charges, fines, and penalties then due and payable.
   (C)   If a bill for water is not paid within 30 days, it shall become
delinquent and a penalty of 7%, compounded monthly, shall be added to the bill.
A notice of delinquency and a second bill showing the gross amount due,
including the penalty, shall be sent to the consumer by U.S. mail. If a
delinquent bill remains unpaid 40 days after the date of the billing, then a
water termination notice shall be sent to the consumer, which notice will
direct the consumer to submit full payment within ten days. If a delinquent
bill remains unpaid 50 days after the date of the billing, then the Village
Manager or his or her designee shall post a yellow termination notice on the
front door of the premises of the delinquent customer, which notice will direct
the customer to submit full payment within ten days. If a delinquent bill
remains unpaid 60 days after the date of the billing, then the Village Manager
or his or her designee shall post a red termination notice on the front door of
the premises of the delinquent customer, which notice will direct the customer
to submit full payment within three business days. If a delinquent bill remains
unpaid after the date specified in the red termination notice, then the Village
Manager may direct the Director of Public Works to shut off the water supply lo
the premises of the delinquent consumer. After the water supply is shut off, it
will not be turned on again until the customer either (i) pays the full amount
of the unpaid bill plus all penalty charges and a reconnection fee in the
amount provided in the annual fee ordinance or (ii) enters into a payment plan
approved by the Village Manager as provided in division (D) below.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a termination notice pursuant to division (C) above, a
consumer may contact the Village Manager or his or her designee and request to
be put on a payment plan. The Village Manager may, in his or her sole
discretion, approve a payment plan with a term of not more than six months,
provided that, before beginning the payment plan, the consumer pays at least
50% of the outstanding bill plus all penalty charges and the reconnection fee.
If the consumer fails to make any payment when due under the payment plan, then
a water termination notice shall be sent to the consumer, and the village shall
follow the notice and termination procedures provided in division (C) above for
bills that are 40 or more days delinquent.
   (E)   Each termination notice shall inform the consumer that the consumer
has a right to request a hearing regarding the water billing by submitting a
written appeal to the Village Manager or his or her designee within three
business days after the date of the termination notice that states the basis
for the appeal and requests a hearing. Within three business days after
receiving such an appeal, the Village Manager will schedule a hearing and send
a notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing to the consumer by U.S.
mail. The notice must be mailed at least five days in advance of the hearing.
If the Village Manager or his or her designee fails to schedule a hearing
within three days after receiving the initial notification of appeal, the
resident shall either deliver a second notification of appeal to the Office of
the Village Manager, via hand-delivery or a courier service (with signature
confirmation by a village employee). The hearing will be conducted by a
committee of two Village Trustees appointed as hearing officers by the Village
President. At the hearing, the consumer shall have the right to appear in
person or through counsel and to present evidence in support of his or her
appeal. The village may conduct its own investigation of the consumer’s appeal
and may present evidence with respect thereto at the hearing. Within seven days
after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officers must issue a final
written order and send a copy of the order to the consumer by U.S. mail. If the
order requires the consumer to pay to the village service charges, penalties,
or other fees or costs, the order must specify the date by which payment is due
and state that water service may be terminated if full payment is not made by
that date. If the consumer fails to make full payment in accordance with the
order, then the Village Manager may direct the Director of Public Works to shut
off the water supply to the consumer’s premises. If the village fails to
conduct a hearing and issue a written order within the timeframes prescribed by
this division (E), then the appeal shall be deemed sustained.
   (F)   The Village Manager is authorized to develop and recommend rules and
procedures for the implementation and administration of this section.

§ 50.09 WATER BILLS A LIEN ON REAL PROPERTY.
   Whenever a bill due the village for water service or any penalty, charge or
cost of the village in seeking collection thereof remain unpaid upon the
expiration of 65 days after the date of the original bill for water service,
the Village Collector may file with the Recorder of Deeds in the county a
statement of a lien claim containing the legal description of the premises
served, the amount of the unpaid bill, penalty, charges and costs of
collection, and a notice that the village claims a lien for the amount as well
as for all charges for water supplied subsequent to the period covered by the
bill. Whenever a bill for water service or other charges remains unpaid for 65
days after the date of the original bill, if the water consumer whose bill is
unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the Village Collector has notice
thereof, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his or her
address is known to the Village Collector. Failure of the Village Collector to
record the lien claim or to mail the notice or failure of the owner to receive
the notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid water
bills, penalty charges and costs of collection thereof. Property subject to a
lien for unpaid charges for water service, penalties, charges and costs may be
sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of sale shall be applied to
pay the charges, after deducting costs of the proceedings, as is the case in
the foreclosure of statutory liens. The foreclosure shall be by bill in equity
in the name of the village. The Village Attorney or other legal counsel
retained by the village is authorized and directed to institute proceedings in
the name of the village and in accordance with applicable law against any
person responsible for unpaid charges and/or any property for which the bill
for water service, penalty charges or costs of collection remain unpaid 65 days
after the date of the original bill.

   When an owner or tenant vacates premises and does not desire to assume
further responsibility for water bills accruing on the premises, he or she may
give notice in writing to the Village Manager to read and remove the meter and
turn off the water supply, and upon receipt of the notice, the Village Manager
shall promptly cause the meter to be read, and may cause the meter to be
removed and the water supply turned off at the main service cock in the public
parkway. Before renewing service for a new owner, the Village Manager shall
require him or her to make an affidavit as to the time of purchase, date of
deed, name of grantor and Recorder’s document number.
(1959 Code, § 38-11)
§ 50.11 WATER SUPPLIED TO SEVERAL CUSTOMERS THROUGH ONE SERVICE PIPE.

same premises are supplied with water through a single pipe connected with the
water service system, the Village Manager may cut off and withhold the water
supply from the service pipe for failure on the part of any one of the
consumers to comply with all provisions of this chapter or to pay or have paid
any sum of money due the village for any water supplied through the service
pipe.
(1959 Code, § 38-12)

unmetered private fire hydrant, without obtaining a permit to do so. The
regular rates for the use of water shall be charged for all water taken from
fire hydrants.
(1959 Code, § 38-14) (Ord. 554, passed 11-14-1966)

   The consumer shall protect the meter installed in or upon the premises
served thereby from excessive cold, backflow of hot water, injury or theft and
the cost of making repairs or replacements resulting from any causes shall be
charged to and be paid by the consumer.
(1959 Code, § 38-16)
§ 50.16 REPAIRS TO METERS TO BE MADE BY VILLAGE ONLY.
   No water meter shall be repaired, changed, altered, disconnected or in any
manner disturbed except by the Village Water Department, provided that in case
of freezing, bad leak or other dangerous emergencies, qualified plumbers may,
without first obtaining a permit, remove the damaged meter from the line, but
in no case from the premises. Notice of the removal shall be filed with the
Village Manager by the plumber within 48 hours after the removal.

own expense, keep in repair all service pipes and appurtenances leading from
the village water main to his or her meter and prevent waste of water from
those mains, service pipes and appurtenances.
   (B)   Every water main leading from village water main which is installed to
serve a private fire hydrant, is hereby designated a private water main, and
every owner of private premises for whose protection from fire the private
water main is or may be installed, shall at his or her own expense, keep the
private water main and the private fire hydrant served thereby and all
appurtenances thereto, in repair and prevent waste of water from the private
water main, private fire hydrant and all appurtenances thereto.
   (C)   If leaks between the village mains and the meter, or in a private
water main or private fire hydrant, are not repaired within two days after
notice is served either upon the owner or person in possession, charge or
control of the premises, in person or by mail, the Director of Public Works may
shut off the water until proper repairs have been made; provided, however, that
if in the opinion of the Superintendent, the leak is of sufficient size to
require that service be shut off sooner, he or she may shut off the service
without notice until the repair is made. No reduction shall be made from the
regular rates as billed on account of leaking pipes, private water mains,
hydrants or fixtures.
(1959 Code, § 38-18) (Ord. 554, passed 11-14-1966)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 BILLS.
   (A)   The rates or charges for wastewater service shall be payable at the
same time and for the same periods as water service charges are billed and
payable. Bills for wastewater service shall be delivered with billings for
water service and shall be due and payable within 30 days after the date of the
billing.
   (B)   The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the
wastewater service (collectively referred to as “consumer” for purposes of this
section) shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the charges of the
village for wastewater service to the premises. Any person responsible for the
payment of any wastewater service charges imposed by the village who shall fail
to pay the charges when due shall be responsible for payment of the costs
incurred by the village, including the fees and costs of any attorney and/or
collection agency retained by the village for the purpose of seeking collection
of the charges, whether or not suit is instituted, in addition to all other
fees, charges, fines, and penalties then due and payable. When an owner or
occupant vacates a premises and does not desire to assume further
responsibility for wastewater service charges, he or she shall give notice in
writing to the Village Manager requesting termination of wastewater service
and, upon receipt of the notice, the charge shall terminate as of the end of
the month in which notice is received, and the water supply to the premises
shall be turned off in accordance with § 50.10.
   (C)   If a bill for wastewater service is not paid within 30 days, it shall
become delinquent and a penalty of 7%, compounded monthly, shall be added to
the bill. A notice of delinquency and a second bill showing the gross amount
due, including the penalty, shall be sent to the consumer by U.S. mail. If a
delinquent bill remains unpaid 40 days after the date of the billing, then a
service termination notice shall be sent to the consumer, which notice will
direct the consumer to submit full payment within ten days. If a delinquent
bill remains unpaid 50 days after the date of the billing, then the Village
Manager or his or her designee shall post a yellow termination notice on the
front door of the premises of the delinquent customer, which notice will direct
the customer to submit full payment within ten days. If a delinquent bill
remains unpaid 60 days after the date of the billing, then the Village Manager
or his or her designee shall post a red termination notice on the front door of
the premises of the delinquent customer, which notice will direct the customer
to submit full payment within three business days. If a delinquent bill remains
unpaid after the date specified in the red termination notice, then the Village
Manager may direct the Director of Public Works to shut off the water supply to
the premises of the delinquent consumer. After the water supply is shut off, it
will not be turned on again until the customer either (i) pays the full amount
of the unpaid bill plus all penalty charges and a reconnection fee in the
amount provided in the annual fee ordinance or (ii) enters into a payment plan
approved by the Village Manager as provided in division (D) below.
   (D)   Upon receipt of a termination notice pursuant to division (C) above, a
consumer may contact the Village Manager or his or her designee and request to
be put on a payment plan. The Village Manager may, in his or her sole
discretion, approve a payment plan with a term of not more than six months,
provided that, before beginning the payment plan, the consumer pays at least
50% of the outstanding bill plus all penalty charges and the reconnection fee.
If the consumer fails to make any payment when due under the payment plan, then
a service termination notice shall be sent to the consumer, and the village
shall follow the notice and termination procedures provided in division (C)
above for bills that are 40 or more days delinquent.
   (E)   Each termination notice shall inform the consumer that the consumer
has a right to request a hearing regarding the wastewater billing by submitting
a written appeal to the Village Manager or his or her designee within three
business days after the date of the termination notice that states the basis
for the appeal and requests a hearing. Within three business days after
receiving such an appeal, the Village Manager will schedule a hearing and send
a notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing to the consumer by U.S.
mail. The notice must be mailed at least five days in advance of the hearing.
If the Village Manager or his or her designee fails to schedule a hearing
within three days after receiving the initial notification of appeal, the
resident shall either deliver a second notification of appeal to the Office of
the Village Manager, via hand-delivery or a courier service (with signature
confirmation by a village employee). The hearing will be conducted by a
committee of two Village Trustees appointed as hearing officers by the Village
President. At the hearing, the consumer shall have the right to appear in
person or through counsel and to present evidence in support of his or her
appeal. The village may conduct its own investigation of the consumer’s appeal
and may present evidence with respect thereto at the hearing. Within seven days
after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officers must issue a final
written order and send a copy of the order to the consumer by U.S. mail. If the
order requires the consumer to pay to the village service charges, penalties,
or other fees or costs, the order must specify the date by which payment is due
and state that service may be terminated if full payment is not made by that
date. If the consumer fails to make full payment in accordance with the order,
then the Village Manager may direct the Director of Public Works to shut off
the water supply to the consumer’s premises. If the Village fails to conduct a
hearing and issue a written order within the timeframes prescribed by this
division (E), then the appeal shall be deemed sustained.
   (F)   The Village Manager is authorized to develop and recommend rules and
procedures for the implementation and administration of this section.

§ 56.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the village intends to exercise
its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use
of the public ways and property by utilities by establishing uniform standards
to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without
limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Minimize visual impact and prevent visual blight from the
proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this subchapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into an
agreement may request that the village enter into an agreement. In this
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, the franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the agreement and
any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of the franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the agreement and
any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other subchapters. This subchapter supersedes all
subchapters or parts of subchapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith, to the extent of the conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
subchapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter
to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or
regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this subchapter and may vary the standards,
conditions and requirements expressed in this subchapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

§ 56.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village Manager
within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not conform to
the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
the Village Manager shall reject the application in writing, stating the
reasons therefor. If the Village Manager is satisfied that the proposed work
conforms to the requirements of this subchapter and applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules and regulations, the Village Manager shall issue a permit
therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the
applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village Manager, that the
construction proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with
the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this subchapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. This notice shall consist of plans, specifications
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The Village Manager shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Village Manager fails to provide the
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications retailer
in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this subchapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of the specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
56.04 of this subchapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. The
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (A) above.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable

submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided
the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances and
regulations.
(Ord. 989, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 56.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on village rights-of- way, and
does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge
upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights- of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion; provided, however,
that permits for small wireless facilities shall be subject to the duration
provided for SWF permits in §
56.23 .
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. Unless waived in writing by the
Village Manager, no construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under
this subchapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors
and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-
construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date,
time and place designated by the village with the village representatives in
attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their
locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-
way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 989, passed 12-10-2007; Ord. 1224, passed 8-20-2018)

material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
56.21 of this subchapter. If the village denies the request for a variance,
then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or
modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised
drawings or plans therefor.
(Ord. 989, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 56.08 INSURANCE.

insureds on the policies listed in subparagraphs(A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X,” “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and

contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then the contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis so that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover the loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.

registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the Village Manager of the intent to cancel or not to
renew.
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of the notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance,
to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under
subsection (A) above, or the requirements of subsections (B), (C) and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (A) above,
such as evidence that the utility is a “private self-insurer” under the
Worker’s Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by those insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state.
(Ord. 989, passed 12-10-2007)

and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether the acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited
by this subchapter or by a franchise, license or similar agreement; provided,
however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to
any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising
out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
subchapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 989, passed 12-10-2007)
§ 56.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
subchapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Manager, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform the restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Manager
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this subsection (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under

      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and the installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their

by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (three-tenths meters) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes
shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that particular
section of the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided

fee equal to one-half of the applicable license fee shall be payable with
respect to any vehicle not licensed as herein provided within 15 days following
the first day of the license year or, where applicable, the day the vehicle is
first required to be licensed during the license year. For purposes of
determining fees applicable to a particular motor vehicle, gross weight and
other licensing factors shall be determined in the manner prescribed by statute
for determining those factors for the purpose of fixing state license fees.
   (D)   Green vehicle discount. If qualified, an applicant for a license
provided for in subsection (C) above shall be entitled to pay a discounted
license fee as established in the annual fee ordinance based on his or her
rating or score in the most recent United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s (USEPA) Green Vehicle Guide, as follows: vehicles manufactured after
model year 2006 rated SmartWay™ by USEPA, or for model years 2000 through 2005,
that received scores of at least six or higher on both the USEPA Air Pollution
and Greenhouse Gas Scores, and a combined score of at least 13.
   (E)   In administering the discounts provided for in subsection (D) above,
the Village Manager is authorized to promulgate application forms related
thereto and require the submission of such information as may be reasonably
necessary to ascertain the applicant’s or vehicles, as the case may be,
qualifications for the discount. It is the obligation of the vehicle license
applicant to supply information as may be reasonably required by the Village
Manager to determine eligibility for these discounts, and failure to submit the
information shall disqualify the applicant from receiving a discount.
   (F)   When a vehicle licensed hereunder is sold or disposed of during the
license year for which the license is issued and the former owner desires to
have a duplicate license issued for a new or substitute vehicle, he or she
shall remove the sticker or license plate, as the case may be, from the vehicle
sold or disposed of and present same to the village with an application for a
duplicate license upon a form prescribed by the village setting forth the name
and address of the applicant, a description of the newly acquired vehicle to
which the duplicate license is to be issued, and any other information as may
be required on the form. If the duplicate license is for a vehicle of the same
class as that for which the license was originally issued, the Village Clerk
shall issue the duplicate license for use upon the new or substitute vehicle
upon the payment of a fee. If the duplicate license is for a vehicle of a class
for which the payment of a greater fee is required by this section, the
applicant shall pay to the village in addition to the fee for the duplicate
license, the difference between the amount previously paid for the license for
the vehicle sold or disposed of and the amount that would be payable for a new
license for the new or substitute vehicle as of the time the new or substitute
vehicle is first required to be licensed during the license year. If the
duplicate license is for a vehicle of a class for which payment of a lesser fee
would be required by this section the village shall issued the duplicate
license for the new or substitute vehicle without the payment of any further
license fee other than the fee for the duplicate license. All fees under this
provision shall be as established in the annual fee ordinance.
   (G)   All revenues derived from vehicle license fees collected pursuant to
this section shall be used for the purpose of improving, paving, repairing or
maintaining the streets or other public roadways within the village, except
that the actual cost of collection of the fees and the disbursement thereof may
be deducted from the total amount collected.

      MINOR. A person under the age of 18 years.

tobacco leaf, including specifically, but without limitation cigarettes,
cigars, snuff and pipe, chewing or dipping tobacco.

within the corporate limits of the village.

(1959 Code, §§ 8-5 and 8-6) (Ord. 1003, passed 9-8-2008)
§ 113.06 SMOKE FREE REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Background. Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal
health of those in the environment of smoke as well as the potential damage to
property which may result from the combustible nature of the substance. It has
been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers
and nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are
considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide,
nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68% of the smoke produced by
a cigarette) affects the health of a bystander, interfering with respiratory
tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative
reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer. Because the hazards of smoking
have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public health,
safety, welfare, comfort and property of residents of the village, it is,
therefore, necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit
smoking in enclosed public places and places of employment.
   (B)   Purpose. This section may be cited as the “Kenilworth Smoke Free
Ordinance,” the purpose of which is to protect the public health, comfort and
environment by prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places and places of
employment, in order to ensure that nonsmokers may breathe air free from the
hazardous effects of secondhand smoke.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning. If a word or phrase is not specifically defined in this
section it shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Smoke Free Illinois
Act.
      ENTRANCE.
         (a)   The doorway or other entrance to a public place that is open to,
and intended for the use by, the general public for ingress and egress to the
public place; and
         (b)   The doorway or other entrance to a place of employment that is
open to, and intended for use by, the general public or business invitees for
ingress and egress to a place of employment, or where employees are required or
permitted to enter or exit.
      PUBLIC PLACE. The portion of any building or vehicle used by and open to
the public, regardless of whether the building or vehicle is owned in whole or
in part by private persons or entities, or any public entity and regardless of
whether a fee is charged for admission, including a minimum distance, as set
forth in the Smoke Free Illinois Act, of 15 feet from entrances, exits, windows
that open and ventilation intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is
prohibited. A PUBLIC PLACE does not include a private residence unless the
private residence is used to provide licensed child care, foster care or
similar social service care on the premises.
      SMOKE FREE ILLINOIS ACT. The Smoke Free Illinois Act, 410 ILCS 82/1 et
seq., as it may be amended from time to time.
   (D)   Acknowledgment of applicability of the Smoke Free Illinois Act.
      (1)   Applicability of the Smoke Free Illinois Act. The village hereby
acknowledges that the Smoke Free Illinois Act is applicable, and is in full
force and effect, within the village. No person shall smoke in any place in the
village where smoking is prohibited pursuant to the Smoke Free Illinois Act.
      (2)   Most restrictive provision controls. In the event of a conflict
between the Smoke Free Illinois Act and the provisions of this section, the
most restrictive provision shall control.
   (E)   Prohibitions; smoking in public places, places of employment and
governmental vehicles prohibited. No person shall smoke in a public place or in
any place of employment or within 15 feet of any entrance to a public place or
place of employment. No person may smoke in any vehicle owned, leased or
operated by the state or a political subdivision of the state. Smoking is
prohibited in indoor public places and workplaces unless specifically exempted
by the Smoke Free Illinois Act.
   (F)   Signs and ashtrays. Each owner, operator, manager or other person in
control of any place within which smoking is prohibited pursuant to this
section shall:
      (1)   Conspicuously post signs indicating that smoking is prohibited in
the same manner as is provided in §§ 20(a) and 20(b) of the Smoke Free Illinois
Act, 410 ILCS 82/20(a) and 20(b); provided, however, that in the event that
there is no clearly defined entrance to a place within which smoking is
prohibited pursuant to this section, the signs shall be posted on or adjacent
to an existing identification sign located on the property; and
      (2)    Remove all ashtrays from the place within which smoking is
prohibited, in the same manner as provided in § 20(c) of the Smoke Free
Illinois Act, 410 ILCS 82/20(c).
   (G)   Owner and occupant responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any person
who is the owner, occupant or lessee of any place where smoking is prohibited
pursuant to this section to permit smoking in that place.
(Ord. 1003, passed 9-8-2008)
§ 113.99 PENALTY.

§ 135.05 NUISANCES; AUTHORITY TO ABATE.
   (a)   Generally. The Village Manager or any member of the Police Department
is authorized to abate any public nuisance existing in the village, whether or
not the nuisance is one specifically recognized as such by the provisions of
this code or any other ordinance of the village or laws of the state.
   (B)   Abatement. Whenever complaint is made to the Village Manager that a
public nuisance exists or has existed within the village, the Village Manager
shall cause the premises to be inspected and shall cause a report thereof to be
made. Except as otherwise provided in §§
135.03 and
135.04:
      (1)   If the inspecting officer or representative shall report that a
public nuisance exists on private property in the village or shall report
conditions that lead to the conclusion that a public nuisance exists on private
property in the village, and that there is great and immediate danger to the
public health, safety, peace, morals or decency, the Village Manager may direct
the Chief of Police to serve notice on the owner or occupant of the property,
or on any person controlling the property or causing, permitting or maintaining
the public nuisance, or if the owner, occupant or other person cannot be
located or served with notice reasonably promptly, to post notice on the
premises. The notice shall direct the owner or occupant of, or other person
controlling, the premises, or any other person who shall appear to be
responsible for causing, permitting or maintaining the public nuisance to abate
and remove the public nuisance within 24 hours, or a longer time as shall be
specified in the notice, and shall state that unless the public nuisance is so
abated within the time specified, the village will cause the same to be abated
and will charge the cost thereof to the owner or occupant of the premises or
other person controlling the premises or causing, permitting or maintaining the
public nuisance. If the public nuisance is not abated within the time provided
or if the owner or occupant of the premises or other person controlling the
premises or causing, permitting or maintaining the public nuisance cannot be
located or served with notice, the Village Manager shall cause the abatement or
removal of the public nuisance.
      (2)   If the inspecting officer shall determine that a public nuisance
exists on private property but that the nature of the public nuisance is not
such that creates a great and immediate danger to the public health, safety,
peace, morals or decency, the inspecting officer shall file a written report of
the findings with the Village Manager, who shall cause legal action to be
commenced in the name of the village to abate or remove the public nuisance in
the name of the village.
   (C)   Costs. In addition to any penalty imposed by village code or ordinance
for the creation, continuance or maintenance of a public nuisance, the costs
incurred by the village in abating or removing a public nuisance (including
reasonable attorney’s fees) shall be collected as a debt of the owner or
occupant of the premises or other person controlling the premises or causing,
permitting or maintaining the public nuisance. Except as otherwise provided in
§§
135.03 and
135.04, if notice to abate has been given to the owner of record of the
premises, or if the owner of record cannot be located and notice has been
posted on the premises, the costs shall, at the option of the village and to
the extent permitted by law, be assessed against the premises and the village
shall have a lien against the premises for the costs, enforceable in the manner
provided by law for the enforcement of mechanics liens.

accompanied by the required demolition escrow amount to be deposited in the
demolition escrow account established by the village. No interest shall be
payable on any funds retained in the demolition escrow account.
      (2)   Charges against demolition escrow. From the date of filing of any
application, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the actual costs
that may be reimbursed from the escrow amount in connection with processing the
application. The Village Manager, or his or her designee, shall, from time to
time, draw funds from the demolition escrow account established for the
application to pay actual costs and shall transfer the funds to the appropriate
village accounts. The Village Manager, or his or her designee, shall maintain
an accurate record of all the drawings from the demolition escrow account.
      (3)   Final settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the Village Manager, or his or her designee, shall
cause a final accounting to be made of the demolition escrow amounts deposited
in connection with the application and of the actual costs incurred and
reimbursable to the village in connection with the application. A copy of the
accounting shall be provided to the owner and the applicant. Any remaining
funds in the demolition escrow after payment of the total actual costs due
pursuant to this section shall be returned to, or applied to the demolition
permit fee due at permit issuance from, the owner or applicant, as applicable.
   (E)   Condition of all applications, approvals and permits. No application
filed pursuant to §
150.028 of this code shall be considered complete unless and until all fees and
deposits due pursuant to this section have been paid. Every approval granted
and every permit issued for a demolition shall, whether or not expressly so
conditioned, be deemed to be conditioned upon payment of demolition escrow fees
as required by this section.
   (F)   Tolling of time periods. Where the Building Code provides that the
passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or a
recommendation for approval, time periods shall be tolled during any period of
nonpayment of the demolition escrow amounts due pursuant to this section, but
shall otherwise continue to run.
   (G)   Failure to pay demolition escrow fees. The failure to pay in full when
due any demolition escrow amount required under this section shall be grounds
for refusing to process an application and for denying, stopping work under, or
revoking any demolition permit.

150.026 may file an application for preliminary historic and architectural
review and a determination of whether or not the building or property is of
special importance pursuant to §§
150.040 through

150.025 through
150.029 and shall be processed in accordance with §§
150.028 and
150.040. The filing of such an application does not obligate the co-applicants
to perform any demolition work.
   (B)   In the event that a building or property is determined not to be of
special importance, the co-applicants for that building or property may
complete the process of application for a demolition permit by filing an
amended application within seven years after the date of such determination in

importance, all as set forth in §§
150.020 through
150.030.
   (B)   In connection with this review, the Building Review Commission may
seek outside professional assistance in gathering factual information regarding

PROPERTIES OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE
§ 150.054 PREDETERMINATION OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR CERTAIN BUSINESS DISTRICT
PROPERTIES.
   (A)   Subject to division (B) below, the Building Review Commission finds
that the properties identified as having special importance in the Downtown
Intensive-Level Survey prepared by Benjamin Historic Certifications and dated
June 12, 2023, as amended (“Historic Survey”), have special importance, and, as
a result, no further Building Review Commission determination of special
importance is necessary for these properties. To provide adequate time for
consideration of alternatives to demolition of the existing building or
buildings located on any property the Historic Survey designates as having
special importance, upon receipt of a demolition permit application, the code
official shall order a stay of issuance of the permit for a period ending not
later than one year, or a lesser period as the Building Review Commission shall
deem appropriate, after the later of the dates below, and the provisions of §
150.056 shall, without limitation, apply to the property:
      (1)   The date the code official determines the demolition permit
application to be complete in accordance with §
150.028; or
      (2)   Any filing of a change in or addition to the persons required to be
disclosed under §§
150.026 and
150.027 that is filed prior to the end of the stay period. The stay order shall
be issued to the applicant and the owner.
   (B)   The owner of a property the Historic Survey identifies as having
special importance may, as an alternative to the procedure set forth in
division (A) above, file an application asking the Building Review Commission
to review and determine whether the owner’s property is of special importance,
all in accordance with the standards and procedures identified in §
150.030.
   (C)   The Building Review Commission finds that any property located in the
Business District as of the Historic Survey’s date that the Historic Survey
does not designate as having special importance is not a property of special
importance, and, as a result, (1) no further Building Review Commission
determination of special importance is necessary for these properties; and (2)
payment of a demolition escrow in accordance with §
150.029 is not required. The applicant for any such property may apply for a
demolition permit in accordance with the procedures applicable to properties
that do not have special importance, all as set forth in §§
150.020 through
150.030.
   (D)   The village will exercise reasonable efforts to update the Historic
Survey every ten years or when practicable.

driveways, sidewalks or other surfaces, in order to allow maximum air and water
penetration to tree roots.
   (D)   Tree protection procedures during construction. Prior to issuance of a
building permit, the Village Manager, or his or her designee, shall determine
tree preservation procedures for trees on the property and on any adjacent
private or public property within 15 feet of lot lines. The tree preservation
procedures shall include, but are not limited to, the requirements set forth in
the following paragraphs.
      (1)   Protective fencing. In areas where vehicular traffic and material
storage is not necessary, protective fencing shall be installed around trees
and critical root areas. The protective fencing and the areas it encloses shall
be subject to the following standards:
         (a)   The owner and the owner’s general contractor shall be jointly
responsible for requesting an inspection of the protective fencing required by
the tree protection plan, and no other construction activity shall be permitted

approved the protective fencing;
         (b)   The protective fencing shall not be moved or removed without the
prior inspection and approval of the Village Manager, or his or her designee;
         (c)   All protective fencing shall be wire mesh or welded wire fencing
four feet high with steel or wooden posts installed and spaced no more than
eight feet apart and securely anchored;

tree, but in no case shall fencing be less than a radius of ten feet from
protected trees and no less than 15 feet from heritage trees; and
         (e)   Protective fencing must be properly maintained in an erect
position at all times, as approved by the Village Manager, or his or her
designee. During construction and until completion, the area within the fencing
shall be a no-use area, in which all construction activities such as the
movement and placement of equipment or material, and the storage of spoils, is
prohibited; provided that nothing herein shall relieve the owner of the
responsibility to keep the construction site, including the no-use area, free
from litter and overgrowth.
      (2)   Protection of tree limbs, tree trunks and critical root zones. Tree
limbs, tree trunks and critical root zones shall be protected in areas where
vehicular traffic, material storage or construction activity may occur.
Examples of such protection include, but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   Tree branch pruning by a certified arborist to minimize damage
prior to construction activity caused by heavy equipment, vehicular traffic, or
construction activity;
         (b)   Root pruning by a certified arborist prior to excavation
activities, with the root pruning at a depth of 18 to 24 inches below grade and
located 12 inches behind the excavation line;
         (c)   Bridging to minimize compaction of tree roots in critical root
zones, which shall consist of, but not limited to, applying eight inches of
wood chips in the critical root zone or covering the critical root zone with
sheets of exterior plywood that is at least three-quarters-inch thick; and
         (d)   Protecting tree trunks with wood planks, which shall: (i)
measure two feet by four feet, two feet by six feet, or one foot by six feet;
(ii) be erected vertically and continuously around the tree trunk; and (iii) be
fastened in place with metal wires or banding.
      (3)   Underground utilities. Where the only available route for
underground utilities runs through a critical root zone, all such utilities
shall be installed by auguring rather than by open trench methods.
         (a)   Commencement of auguring shall begin at a distance from the
tree’s base of at least one foot for every one inch of DBH, up to a maximum
distance of 20 feet from the tree’s base. The same minimum distance shall apply
to the auguring exit.
         (b)   The auguring shall be done at least 24 inches below the soil
surface.
      (4)   The owner and the owner’s general contractor shall be jointly
responsible for requesting an inspection of underground utility work, and no
other construction activity shall be permitted unless and until the Village
Manager has inspected and approved such work.
      (5)   Grade changes within the drip line of a tree, such as filling or
lowering, are prohibited unless approved by the Village Manager.
      (6)   In addition to complying with the various yard setback requirements
of Chapter 153 of this code, all buildings and other structures shall be
located on a lot or parcel of land so as to minimize damage to and/or removal
of protected trees and heritage trees.
   (E)   Tree protection procedures following construction. In order to
maximize the long-term survivability and growth of protected trees and heritage
trees on a construction site, the Village Manager may require post-construction
measures to be undertaken on a construction site prior to final inspection or
closeout of a building permit. The measures to be taken may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Root aeration to remediate soil compaction around the root systems
of protected trees and heritage trees. This work may only be performed by a
certified arborist.
      (2)   Fertilization, to provide existing protected trees and heritage
trees with nutrients and trace elements to promote healthy growth.
Fertilization may be accomplished by root injection feeding, spraying, or
topical application, and shall not apply to newly planted trees.
      (3)   Pruning or trimming of protected trees and heritage trees in
accordance with national standards to promote healthy growth and remove
diseased or dead branches. Pruning undertaken pursuant to this section shall be
performed by a certified arborist or under the direction of the Village
Manager.
      (4)   Mulching, to provide a protective, moisture-retaining layer around
the base of a tree, to help assure healthy growth.
      (5)   Any additional measures deemed necessary by the Village Manager to
assure the continued health of protected trees and heritage trees on the
property.
   (F)   Exceptions. The Village Manager, or his or her designee, may waive any
requirement of this section in the event that the Village Manager, or his or
her designee, determines that the construction activity is minimal in nature
and will not, or is not reasonably likely to, cause impact on, damage to, or
removal of, a protected tree or heritage tree.
(Ord. 1215, passed 2-12-2018)
§ 150.167 SECURITY.
   The Village Manager shall require an applicant for a tree permit to provide
the village with a letter of credit, bond or cash deposit to secure the tree
replacement obligations required pursuant to §
150.164 or the tree protection measures required pursuant to §
150.166(C), where the amount of the security as determined under this section
is in an amount as established in the annual fee ordinance. The amount of the
security shall be determined by the Village Manager and shall be equal to the
total cost of the required replacement trees based on the formula set forth in
§
150.165(B) or the total cost of strictly complying with and fully implementing
the tree protection measures, as the case may be. If the Village Manager
determines that the applicant has neglected or refused, following written
notice, to comply with the tree replacement obligations or to implement the
tree protection measures, as the case may be, the Village Manager is authorized
to perform or to cause to be performed the work and to apply an amount
equivalent to the actual costs of the work from the security. Upon completion
of the tree replacement or the tree protection measures, as the case may be,
the security, or any remainder thereof, shall be returned or released to the
applicant.

                         certificate of occupancy of a portion of the work covered under the building
           Temporary     permit, before the completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided

                         months, unless an extension is granted by the Building Commissioner. To obtain a

                         (a)   Sign a written agreement with the Village stipulating remaining work to be
                         done and/or deficiencies which must be corrected. Such agreement may contain

                         of the Village by the Building Commissioner. Such agreement shall be co-signed
                         by the owner, contract purchaser and/or the tenant; and
                         (b)    Post an additional cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit
                         acceptable to the Village Manager, in an amount equivalent to (1) 110 percent of
                         the estimated cost of completing and/or remedying all items stipulated to in the
                         agreement (which amount shall be not less than an amount established by the
                         Board of Trustees by resolution from time to time) plus (2) a temporary
                         certificate of occupancy fee in amounts established by the Board of Trustees by
                         resolution from time to time.

                         certificate of occupancy by the date established by the Building Commissioner
                         shall result in automatic forfeiture of the related cash deposit or irrevocable
                         letter of credit. The Building Commissioner may, but shall not be obligated to,
                         use such forfeited funds to complete the work indicated on the inspection report
                         attached to the temporary certificate of occupancy, which was issued for the
                        premises. Such forfeiture shall not impair the right of the Village to enforce
                         any and all remedies available to it by reason of any violation, including the
                         right to recover a fine or penalty or seek injunctive relief. In the event that
                         the Building Commissioner uses such forfeited funds, he or she shall assess and
                         deduct an administrative fee equal to 10 percent of the amount of forfeited
                         funds used. Any balance remaining in the cash deposit or irrevocable letter of
                         credit not required to complete the work shall be refunded to the depositor upon
                         issuance of a final certificate of occupancy.

§ 150.445 DRAINAGE AND GRADING STANDARDS.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   All regulated activities shall meet or exceed the applicable
minimum standards of federal, state, regional, or other local agencies having
jurisdiction over the work governed by the permit, including, without
limitation, the latest edition of the Cook County Watershed Management
Ordinance.
      (2)   No regulated activity shall be allowed to alter the ground surface
such that runoff will be diverted onto or detained on an adjacent property that
the permittee does not have the right to use.
      (3)   No regulated activity shall be allowed to significantly alter
existing drainage patterns or discharge concentrated stormwater runoff onto an
adjacent property.
      (4)   All downspouts shall discharge in accordance with §
52.039 of this code.
      (5)   Concentrated discharges to the ground surface, such as those from
storm drains, downspouts, and sump pumps, shall discharge in accordance with §
52.039. No concentrated discharge created on or after November 1, 2016 shall be
constructed within 25 feet of a village sidewalk or ten feet of an adjacent
property line, except in cases where the owner of the subject property has an
ownership interest in, or an easement on, the adjacent property.
      (6)   No pavement created on or after November 1, 2016 shall be
constructed within two feet of a property line, except pavement necessary for
authorized driveway access from the property to a public or private right-of-
way, or in cases where the owner of the subject property has an ownership
interest in, or an easement on, the adjacent property.
      (7)   Depressional storage areas that will be filled or drained by a
regulated activity shall be replaced on the subject property as a new
depressional storage area or as part of a stormwater detention system.
      (8)   Ground slopes shall be no steeper than 25%, unless permanent ground
treatments that do not require mowing are used.
   (B)   Soil erosion and sediment control standards.
      (1)   Acceptable control measures include, but are not limited to: silt
fence, ditch checks, erosion control blanket, stabilized construction
entrances, and inlet protection. Control measures shall meet the minimum
standards and specifications of the Illinois Urban Manual, unless otherwise
modified by the code official pursuant to the applicable procedures of this
code. If the minimum standards and specifications of the Illinois Urban Manual
conflict with the other provisions of this code, the requirements that provide
the greatest protection to the public, as determined by the code official,
shall govern and control.
      (2)   Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize
erosion. Areas that are not to be disturbed shall be protected from
construction equipment or other disturbance until final stabilization is
achieved.
      (3)   Soil stabilization measures shall consider the time of year, site
conditions, and the use of temporary or permanent control measures.
      (4)   Adjacent properties shall be protected from erosion and
sedimentation. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at concentrated
discharge locations as necessary to prevent erosion.
      (5)   Sediment control measures shall be installed prior to the
disturbance of upland areas.
      (6)   Stabilization of disturbed areas shall be initiated immediately
whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth disturbing activities
have permanently ceased on the site, or temporarily ceased on the site for a
period exceeding seven days.
      (7)   All temporary control measures shall be removed within seven days
after final stabilization of the site is achieved, or after the temporary
measures are no longer necessary, as determined by the code official. Trapped
sediment shall be removed and disturbed areas shall be permanently stabilized.
   (C)   Stormwater detention standards.
      (1)   Stormwater detention shall be required on the subject property for
the following regulated activities:
         (a)   Construction of any new residence, including construction of a
new residence on an existing foundation;
         (b)   Construction of any new commercial building; and
         (c)   Construction of a “substantial alteration,” as this term is
defined in
Chapter 153 of this code, as amended.
      (2)   The required volume of stormwater detention shall be determined
using the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago’s Modified
Rational Method with the data and design conditions listed below:
         (a)   The rainfall intensity shall be based on the Illinois State
Water Survey, Bulletin 75 Precipitation Frequency Study for Illinois, published
in 2020.
         (b)   The allowable release rate for existing and proposed conditions
shall be based on a runoff coefficient of 0.15 and the rainfall intensity for a
three-year storm event.
         (c)   The composite runoff coefficient for the proposed conditions
shall be based on the maximum impermeable lot coverage allowed by
Chapter 153 of this code, as amended.
         (d)   The required volume of stormwater detention shall be the
difference in the storage volume calculated for existing and proposed
conditions for a 100-year storm event.
      (3)   Stormwater storage volume located within the void space of best
management practices, such as a rain garden or the aggregate base of permeable
pavement, may be credited toward the required stormwater detention volume
according to the following standards:
         (a)   The maximum void space shall be 36% for gravel and 25% for
engineered soil.
         (b)   No more than 25% of the required stormwater detention volume may
be provided within the aggregate base of permeable pavement.
         (c)   No more than 25% of the required stormwater detention volume may
be provided within a rain garden.
      (4)   The volume of depressional storage areas that will be filled or
drained by a regulated activity may be replaced as part of a stormwater
detention system.
      (5)   All runoff from the new impervious areas of the site shall be
routed to the stormwater detention facility. The system shall convey the 100-
year peak rate of runoff from the impervious areas to the facility, with a
minimum of six inches of freeboard against overflowing off-site.
   (D)   Building elevation standards.
      (1)   The first floor elevation for any new single-family residential
construction on a previously developed property shall not exceed the first
floor elevation of the previous residence, unless otherwise approved by the
Public Works Director to account for a documented environmental condition
associated with the property.
      (2)   The lowest floor elevation for any new building construction which
includes a basement, cellar or crawlspace on a previously developed property
shall not be lower than at least 18 inches above the seasonal high groundwater
elevation. The seasonal high groundwater elevation for the subject property
shall be determined by a qualified professional.

§ 150.446 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection from drainage hazards required by these regulations
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations; however, on occasion, extreme storms may occur and
result in greater flood heights and drainage hazards. Furthermore, flood
heights or drainage hazards may be increased by other man-made or natural
causes. These provisions do not imply that land outside of mapped flood hazard
areas, or that uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
drainage hazards. These provisions shall not create liability on the part of
the village, nor any officer or employee thereof, for any damage that results
from reliance on these regulations, activities for which a permit is issued
pursuant to this subchapter, or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A non-habitable building, used only for parking of
vehicles or storage, that is on the same parcel of property as the principal
building and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal
building.
   ACT. "An Act in Relation to the Regulation of the Rivers, Lakes and Streams
of the State of Illinois," Illinois Revised Statutes 1991, Chapter 19,
Paragraph 52, et seq.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application pursuant to this chapter.
   APPROPRIATE USE. A use of the regulatory floodway that is listed in 17
Illinois Administrative Code 3708 and that will not cause a rise in the base
flood elevation and will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase
in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety.
Approved appropriate uses are specified in §
151.07(D).
   AVERAGE LOT GRADE. The mathematical average of the ground elevation as
measured at all of the corners of the buildable area of a parcel of land. As
used in this definition, the term "buildable area" shall have the same
definition as provided in § 17.04.020(B)(6) of this code.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one percent probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. The base flood is often referred to as the 100-year
flood.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The height in relation to the North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified) of the crest of
the base flood. Application of the BFE at any location is as defined in §
151.05.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building, including any sunken room or sunken
portion of a room, having its floor below ground level (subgrade) on all sides.

passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.

the existing surface topography of the Earth prior to engineered changes. A
natural stream tends to follow a meandering path; its floodplain is not
constrained by levees; the area near the bank has not been cleared, mowed or
cultivated; the stream flows over soiled and geologic materials typical of the
area with no substantial alteration of the course or cross-section of the
stream caused by filling or excavating. A modified channel may regain some
natural characteristics over time as the channel meanders and vegetation is re-
established. Similarly, a modified channel may be restored to more natural
conditions through regrading and revegetation.

portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by
IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100- year frequency
flood discharge with no more than a one-tenth foot increase in stage due to the
loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10% increase in
velocities.

and 0260K dated September 10, 2021, of the countywide FIRM for Cook County,
Illinois, prepared by the FEMA.
      (3)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks, to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated

the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other
improvement, was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of a building on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, including the placement of
a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial improvement, actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
   STATEWIDE PERMITS. Permits that are offered for pre-approved projects that

value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
improvement of a building, taken over a ten-year period in which the cost, as
substantiated by an executed contract that outlines the entire scope of work,
in which the percentage of improvements, figured (cumulatively) by dividing the
cost of each improvement by the market value of the building prior to the start
of construction of each improvement, equals or exceeds 50%.
      (1)   Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building. This term includes buildings which have incurred
repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a building to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

to the requirements of this code.
      (3)   Any development located on land below the BFE that is that is
hydraulically connected to the floodplain, but not shown on the current FIRM,
is subject to the provisions of this code.
      (4)   The Director shall maintain documentation of the pre-existing
ground elevation at the site and, if applicable, certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first FIRM identification in
the floodplain.
   (E)   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted, the Director shall require that
the minimum requirements of §
151.08 be met.
   (F)   (1)   A floodplain development permit or approval shall become invalid
unless the actual start of construction, for work authorized by such permit, is
commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized is
suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the work commences.
      (2)   The Director shall ensure that all development activities happen in
a timely manner. All permitted work shall be completed within 12 months after
the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall expire. Time extensions,
of not more than 180 days each, may be granted, in writing, by the Director.
Time extensions shall be granted only if the original permit is compliant with
this code and the FIRM and FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.
   (G)   Letters of map revision. The Director shall require a CLOMR prior to
issuance of a development permit for proposed floodway encroachments that will
cause an increase in the BFE; and proposed development which will increase the
BFE by more than one-tenth of a foot in riverine area where FEMA has provided a
BFE but no floodway.
   (H)   Once a CLOMR has been issued, the development permit may be issued for
site grading and structures necessary in the area of the map change to achieve
the final LOMR. Upon completion, the applicant shall submit as-built
certifications, as required by FEMA, to achieve a final LOMR prior to the
release of final development permits. Review §
151.06(G) for the construction of buildings in any floodplain issued a LOMR
based on fill.

§ 151.05 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   This chapter's protection standard is based on the regulatory flood profiles
for the Countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County dated September 10,
2021. If a BFE is unavailable for a particular site, then the protection
standard shall be according to the best existing available data from federal,
state or other sources. When a party disagrees with the best available data or
should no other data source exist, that party may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit
it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for approval.
   (A)   Base flood for Skokie River SFHA. The BFE for the SFHAs of the Skokie
River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide
Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared by the FEMA and dated September
10, 2021, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time.
   (B)   Base flood for SFHAs within the village's extraterritorial
jurisdiction. The BFE for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook
County that are within the one and one-half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction
or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the base
flood profiles in the Countywide Flood Insurance Study for Cook County prepared
by the FEMA and dated September 10, 2021, and such amendments to such study and
maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (C)   Base flood for AH and AO Zones. The BFE for each SFHA delineated as an
AH Zone or AO Zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated Countywide
FIRM of Cook County and as described in § 601.4.B-C of the WMO.
   (D)   Base Flood for A Zones. The BFE for each of the remaining SFHAs
delineated as an A Zone on the Countywide FIRM of Cook County shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state, or other
sources. When no BFE exists, the BFE shall be determined according to § 601.6
of the WMO. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use
conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land
use plans. Along any watercourse draining more than one square mile, the above
analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval.
   (E)   The BFE for any Zone VE floodplain, and for a zone AE floodplain in an
area subject to flooding effects from Lake Michigan, shall be the highest
elevation specified on the FIRM among all flood zones affecting the proposed
development. Where development is proposed to encroach upon a riverine Zone AE
which is subject to flooding effects from Lake Michigan, the requirements of §
151.08 shall apply to the entire floodplain.
(Ord. 1284, passed 8-16-2021)
§ 151.06 OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe is subject to the
provisions of this section and will only be permitted if protection is provided
against the base flood and if other applicable requirements of this chapter are
met. No use will be permitted if it adversely affects the capacity of drainage
facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet
the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of §
151.09.
   (A)   Floodplain development permit required. No person, firm, corporation
or governmental body, other than exempt organizations, shall commence any
development in the SFHA without first obtaining a floodplain development permit
from the Director.
   (B)   Application and site plan. Application for a floodplain development
permit shall be made on a form provided by the Director. The application shall
meet the requirements of Article 3 of the WMO and this chapter. For all
proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and
lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development
will be subject to the requirements of §
151.09. The drawing shall be sealed by a registered professional engineer.
   (C)   Review of application. Upon receipt of a floodplain development permit
application, the Director shall compare the elevation of the site to the BFE.
If, upon review, the Director determines that the development is located on
land that is higher than the base flood elevation of the current FIRM and that
has not been filled since the date of the site's first FIRM identification, the
property shall be considered outside of the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to
the requirements of this chapter. The Director shall maintain documentation of
the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first FIRM
identification.
   (D)   Duties and responsibilities of Director. The Director shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state,
and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be
required for the proposed activity. The Director shall not issue a permit
unless copies of all other local, state and federal permits have been submitted
by the applicant.
   (E)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
   (F)   Use of fill to elevate site.
      (1)   Fill shall not be used to elevate a site unless the average lot
grade is equal to or greater than the minimum average lot grade.
      (2)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the BFE, the
applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision from
FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the letter of map revision or in this chapter, no
person who obtains a map revision removing a site from the floodplain shall be
entitled to build the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE,
except as provided in §
151.06(G).
   (G)   Constructing lowest floor below BFE. A person who has obtained a
letter of map revision that removes a site in the flood fringe from the
floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply
for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a residential
building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The Director shall not issue such a
permit unless the applicant has complied with all of the criteria set forth in
the following paragraphs of this division.
      (1)   Compensatory storage shall be provided in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e.
window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the FPE.
      (3)   The lowest grade adjacent to the foundation shall be at or above
the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the
structure.
      (4)   The grade around the perimeter of the structures, measured at a
distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
      (5)   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets
all requirements of this division (G) and is at least five feet thick under the
basement floor slab. Nothing in this division (G) shall be interpreted to
require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-
F permit, if such fill consists of material, including soil of similar
classification and degree of permeability, that meets the requirements of this
division (G).
      (6)   The fill material shall be compacted to at least 95% of standard
laboratory maximum dry density (standard proctor), according to ASTM Standard
D-698. Fill soils shall be fine-grained soils of low permeability, such as
those classified as CH, CL, SC, or ML according to ASTM Standard D-2487,
Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
      (7)   The fill material must be homogeneous i.e., all of one material,
and isotropic, i.e., having the engineering properties must be the same in all
directions.
      (8)   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer or Registered Soils
Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions.
      (9)   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than
five feet below the BFE.
      (10)   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab,
and a minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove the seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four
times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away
from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the
floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
      (11)   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
      (12)   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
   (H)   Compensatory storage.
      (1)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically
equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the BFE, provided all of the
conditions § 602.7-9 of the WMO and of the following (H)(2) and (H)(3) of this
section shall be met.
      (2)   In no case shall the depth of excavation for any compensatory
storage in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured
from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard may be permitted to
have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary.
      (3)   The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area
will not be permitted.
(Ord. 1284, passed 8-16-2021)
§ 151.07 OCCUPATION AND USE OF IDENTIFIED FLOODWAYS.
   Any development, redevelopment, site modification or building modification
within a regulatory floodway is subject to the provisions of this section and
shall be permitted only if the criteria of this section and applicable
requirements of this chapter are met. All floodway modifications shall be the
minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the project. The development
shall also meet the requirements of §
151.09.
   (A)   Floodplain development permit. No person, firm, corporation or
governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in a
floodway without first obtaining a floodplain development permit from the
Director.
   (B)   Application. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be
made on a form provided by the Director, which shall include at least the
information required by Article 3 of the WMO.
   (C)   Review and approval of permit applications. The Director shall be
responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state,
and federal permits and approvals that may be required for the proposed
activity. The Director shall not issue the floodplain development permit unless
copies of all required federal and state permits have been submitted by the
applicant. A registered professional engineer under the employ or contract of
the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section.
   (D)   Preventing increased damages; list of appropriate uses. No development
shall be allowed in a floodway unless it is for appropriate uses that will not
cause a rise in the base flood elevation, will not create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity and will not be a
threat to public health and safety. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17
Ill. Adm. Code 3708 and §
602.27 of the WMO will be allowed. Appropriate uses do not include the
construction or placement of any new buildings, structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically
defined above as an appropriate use.
   (E)   Engineering criteria for appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway.
Within the regulated floodway as identified on the Countywide FIRMs for Cook
County, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible;
provided that, the proposed project meets the requirements of §§ 602.7-9 and
25-28 of the WMO, along with the following engineering criteria, and is so
stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered
professional engineer; and provided that, any structure meets the protection
requirements of §
151.09:
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses, all effective regulatory floodway
conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to
and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory
floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Regulatory floodway conveyance,
            'K' = 1.486 AR2/3
                n
         where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of
the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter
(see Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw- Hill Book Company, New
York);
         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative
land cover;
         (c)   Transition section shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency;
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall meet the requirements of § 602.7-9 of the
WMO.
      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities,
unless a water resource benefit is realized and unless scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches. The proposed structures shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up
to and including the 100-year frequency event, unless the area of the increased
flood stages is under the ownership or control of the applicant.
         (a)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages shall be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
151.05.
         (b)   Lost floodway storage shall be compensated for in accordance
with §
151.07(E)(2).
         (c)   Velocity increases shall be mitigated in accordance with §
151.07(E)(3).
         (d)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be obtained by
the applicant.
         (e)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing conditions and proposed regulatory profile shall be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by §
151.07(E).
         (f)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per §
151.07(E)(8).
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and
approach roads.
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood states on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned shall be prepared in
accordance with IDNR/OWR Rules 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         (d)   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage shall be required
to mitigate any potential increase in flow or flood elevations due to the
removal or modification of an existing bridge or culvert.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any
increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero feet when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the area under the ownership or
control of the applicant. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, for a dam safety
permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in
the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as
defined in §
151.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams).
      (7)   Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency.
         (a)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flood stream's length;
         (b)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length;
         (c)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet for stream length
shall be used; and
         (d)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      (10)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory
floodway study, referenced in §
151.05, shall be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, the IDNR/OWR shall be
contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data
to use.
         (b)   If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a large drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         (c)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      (11)   Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would
result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA
all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and received from IDNR/OWR a
conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is
issued. The final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by IDNR/OWR until
as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/
OWR. In the case of nongovernmental projects, the municipality in incorporated
areas and the county in an unincorporated area shall concur with the proposed
conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be
given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a
conditional approval is issued. Once a CLOMR has been issued, a permit may be
issued for site grading and structures necessary in the area of the map change
to achieve the final LOMR. Upon completion, the applicant shall submit as-built
certifications, as required by FEMA, to achieve a final LOMR prior to the
release of final development permits. The regulatory floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as-built
plans, and the effective date of the LOMR is reached.
      (12)   Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of an Illinois registered
professional engineer, retained by the applicant.
   (F)   State review in delegated communities. For those projects listed below
located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
      (1)   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile
due to a proposed bridge pursuant to §
151.07(E)(4).
      (2)   IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing
bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to §
151.07(E)(5).
      (3)   The IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and
hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to §
151.07(E)(1), (E)(2), (E)(8).
      (4)   The IDNR/OWR will review and approve, prior to the start of
construction, any department projects, dams (as defined in §
151.99) and all other state, federal and local units of government projects,
including projects of the Village.
   (G)   Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter,
a floodplain development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be
issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation
that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/5,
et seq.
   (H)   Dam safety permits. Any person performing work involving the
construction, modification or removal of a dam (as defined in §
151.02) pursuant to 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams)
shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to the start of construction
of a dam. If the Director finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit,
the Director shall immediately notify the dam safety section of IDNR/OWR. If
the Director finds a dam that is believed to be in an unsafe condition, the
Director shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, dam safety
section, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
   (I)   Activities that qualify for a regional permit from IDNR/OWR. The
following activities may be permitted without a registered professional
engineer's review, provided they meet the other requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
         (a)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations;
         (b)   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the

§ 151.08 OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOODPLAIN AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT
IDENTIFIED.
   In SFHA or floodplains (including AO Zones, AH zones and unnumbered A Zones)
where no floodways have been identified and no BFEs have been established and
which drains more than one square mile, no development shall be permitted
unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated uses and structures, shall not significantly impede or
increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters and will not significantly
increase the BFE. The development must meet all applicable requirements of this
chapter and 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3700.The development shall also meet the
requirements of § 151.09.
   (A)   Floodplain development permit. No person, firm, corporation or

an SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a floodplain development permit
from the Director, as applicable. Application for a floodplain development
permit shall be made on a form provided by the Director.
   (B)   Duties of Director. The Director shall be responsible for obtaining
from the applicant copies of all other local, state, and federal permits,
approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of
activity. The Director shall not issue the floodplain development permit unless
copies of all required local, state, and federal permits have been submitted to
the Director by the applicant.
   (C)   Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA, where a
floodway has not been determined, shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety, and welfare.
   (D)   Standards within riverine SFHAs. Within all riverine SFHAs where the
floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply.
      (1)   The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state
in writing and show through supporting plans, calculation and data that the
project meets the engineering requirements of the WMO and this chapter.
      (2)   A floodplain development permit shall not be issued unless the
applicant first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a
permit is not required from IDNR/OWR.
      (3)   Dam safety permits. Any person performing work involving the
construction, modification or removal of a dam (as defined in §
151.02) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter indicating a
permit is not required prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
Director finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit, the Director shall
immediately notify the dam safety section of IDNR/OWR. If the Director finds a
dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Director shall immediately
notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, and the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
      (4)   Activities that qualify for a regional or statewide permit from
IDNR/OWR. The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review or calculations of a base flood elevation and
regulatory floodway. Such activities shall meet the other requirements of this
chapter:

§ 602.7-9 of the WMO.
(Ord. 1284, passed 8-16-2021)
§ 151.09 PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO ALL FLOODPLAIN AREAS.
   In addition to the requirements found in §§
151.06,
151.07 and
151.08 of this chapter for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways,
and SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (Zones AO, AH,
AE, A1--A30, A99, VO, V1-V30, VE, V, M, E or X), § 601 and § 602 of the WMO and
the following requirements shall be met:
   (A)   Public health standards. No developments in the SFHA shall include
locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animals' wastes,
fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic
materials below the FPE unless such materials are stored in a floodproofed and
anchored storage tank and certified by a P.E. or floodproofed building
constructed according to the requirements of §
151.09(D)(3).
   (B)   Water and sewer lines. New and replacement water supply systems,
wells, sanitary sewer lines and on-site disposal systems may be permitted
providing all manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE are
watertight and shall meet the requirements of § 602.15-17 of the WMO. New and
replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal systems shall be
located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them
during flooding.
   (C)   Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel
modification, fill or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood-carrying
capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained and the project shall meet the
requirements of § 606 and § 607 of the WMO. In addition, the village shall
notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a
permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse.
   (D)   Public utilities and facilities such as telecommunication, gas and
electric shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
   (E)   All other activities, defined as development, such as pools, fences,
filling, paving, etc., shall be designed so as not to alter flood flows or
increase potential flood damages.
   (F)   Protecting buildings. All buildings located within the SFHA, shall be
protected from flood damage below the FPE. However, existing buildings located
within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate
use standards included in §
151.07. These building protection criteria apply to the following situations:
      (1)   New construction or placement of a new building.
      (2)   A substantial improvement to an existing building.
      (3)   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured
home on an existing site.
      (4)   A substantially damaged building under repair, the entire building
must meet the flood protection standards of this section. Substantial damage
shall be figured cumulatively during a ten-year period by comparing the cost to
repair the building to its pre-damage condition with the market value of the
building immediately prior to the damage, for each event in which the building
sustains damage, and adding the percentages of damage for each event.
      (5)   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for
more than 180 consecutive days.
   (G)   Building protection methods. Building protection requirements may be
met by one of the following methods.
      (1)   Residential buildings. In Zones A, AO, AH, and AE, the lowest
floor, including basement, of new construction of residential buildings, and
substantially improved residential buildings, must be elevated to the FPE, and
are subject to the more specific additional requirements below:
         (a)   If fill, including grading to redistribute onsite material to
alter existing topography, is used as a means of elevation:
            1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot
deep before compaction, must extend at least 20 feet beyond the foundation
before sloping below the FPE in lieu of a geotechnical report, and shall meet
the requirements of § 602 of the WMO. The fill shall be protected against
erosion and scour and shall be composed of clean rock or soil and not include
debris or refuse material. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or
surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
            2.   a.   In order to construct a home with or without a basement,
on a permanent landfill, the following equation must be satisfied:
      Minimum Average Lot Grade =
(FPE-2') - [(Total Required Side Yard-12') x 0.0833].
               b.    Therefore, if the average lot grade elevation on a site is
above the elevation as defined by this equation, then a structure with its
lowest floor below the BFE may be constructed. Otherwise, the structure must be
protected in accordance with §
151.09(E)(2).
         (b)   If the building's lowest floor is elevated above ground level
with an enclosed or unenclosed area below the lowest floor:
            1.   The building shall be elevated on piles, walls, columns, or
other foundation that is permanently open to floodwaters.
            2.   All enclosed areas below the FPE shall provide for
equalization of hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters. A minimum of two permanent openings shall be provided on at
least two walls located below the BFE and no more than one foot above finished
grade. The openings shall provide a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding, or the
design must be certified by a Registered P.E, as providing the equivalent
performance in accordance with accepted standards of practice. Refer to FEMA
TB1, Openings in Foundation Walls and Walls of Enclosures, for additional
guidance.
            3.   All electrical lines, switches, receptacles, and fixtures must
be located above the FPE except to the minimum extent required by applicable
building or life-safety codes. Any switches, receptacles, and/or fixtures
required by applicable building or life-safety codes to extend below the FPE
shall be rated, or located in enclosures rated, for prolonged submersion.
            4.   The building, foundation, and supporting members shall be
adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
building resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy, and be designed so as to minimize exposure to current,
waves, ice, and floating debris.
            5.   All building components below the FPE shall be constructed of
materials resistant to flood damage.
            6.   Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps, and other service facilities may be located below the FPE
provided they are waterproofed.
            7.   The area below the FPE shall be used solely for parking,
storage, or building access and not later modified or occupied as habitable
space.
      (2)   Nonresidential buildings. In zones A, AO, AH, and AE, the lowest
floor (including basement) of new construction of nonresidential buildings, and
substantial improvement of nonresidential buildings, must either (1) be
elevated to or above the FPE, subject to the more specific additional
requirements of §§
151.09(G)(1)(a) through 151.09(G)(1)(b) above; or (2) be structurally dry-
floodproofed, provided a Registered P.E. or architect has developed and/or
reviewed the structural design, specifications, and plans for construction, and
the Registered P.E. or architect submits a FEMA floodproofing certificate,
certifying that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the requirements of ASCE 24-14, and
the following conditions:
         (a)   Below the FPE, the building and attendant utility and sanitary
facilities shall be watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydraulic loads and the effects of buoyancy.
         (b)   The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of
buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice.
         (c)   Floodproofing measures shall be incorporated into the building
design and shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside
source of electricity.
         (d)   The building, utility, and sanitary facilities' design and
construction will prevent the effect of sewer backup into the building.
         (e)   For purposes of this division, levees, berms, floodwalls and
similar works are not considered floodproofing.
      (3)   In a coastal high hazard area (Zone VE) and in any area of Zone AE
designated as a moderate wave action area, the building protection requirements
of this §
151.09(E) must be met according to the following criteria:
         (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is
elevated to or above the FPE, and the pile or column foundation and structure
attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on
all building components.
            1.   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood.
            2.   Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-16 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or other equivalent standard.
         (b)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or
review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of §
151.09(E)(4)(a).
         (c)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
            1.   A breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance
of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds per square foot.
            2.   Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or where so required
by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered professional
engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all of the
following conditions:
               a.    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load
less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
               b.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural).
Water loading values shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind
loading values shall be those defined according to American Society of Civil
Engineers 7-16 Minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and
other structures, or equivalent standard.
               c.   All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood lattice-
work, or insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage.
      (4)   In Zones A, AO, AH and AE, detached accessory structures and
detached garages may be constructed with the lowest floor below the FPE in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   The building shall not be used for human habitation, must not
include areas intended or used for cooking, and must not include bathrooms,
toilet rooms, or shower rooms.

resistant materials.
         (c)   The structure must have at least two permanent openings on at
least two walls not more than one foot above grade and below the BFE, with one
square inch of opening for every one square foot of floor area.
         (d)   The building shall be located outside of the regulatory floodway
unless the building can be constructed and placed on a building site so as not
to block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage, can meet the appropriate use
criteria of §
151.07, and all other requirements of §§
151.06,
151.07 and
151.08.
         (e)   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation and
overturning.
         (f)   All electrical lines, switches, receptacles, and fixtures must
be located above the FPE except to the minimum extent required by applicable
building or life-safety codes. Any switches, receptacles, and/or fixtures
required by applicable building or life-safety codes to extend below the FPE
shall be rated, or located in enclosures rated, for prolonged submersion.
         (g)   The building shall be valued at less than $25,000 as
substantiated by a signed contract be no more than one-story in height, and
shall have a roofed lot coverage of less than 500 square feet.
         (h)   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or
tools and may not contain other rooms, greenhouses or similar uses. All
flammable or toxic materials (gasoline, paint, insecticides, fertilizers, etc.)
shall be stored above the FPE.
         (i)   The lowest floor elevation should be documented, and the owner
advised of the flood insurance implications of building with the lowest floor
below the BFE.
      (5)   Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may
remain in use, but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered,
except to the extent such enlargement, replacement or alteration is permitted
by §
151.07. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural
or man-made disaster may be restored provided the value of the damage is less
than 50% of the structure's market value before it was damaged, and provided
that the restoration conforms to all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (H)   Retaining walls and grading requirements.
      (1)   When retaining walls are used either to bridge the grade
differential between the FPE of the clay building pad for a new structure and
the existing average lot grade on the site, or to create a vertical surface for
any portion of a side of a compensatory storage area, the cumulative height of
the retaining walls in the front and side yards shall not exceed 24 inches.
      (2)   When slopes are used to provide a transition between the existing
grade and the proposed grade for the top of the permanent fill, or for the
construction of a compensatory storage basin, those slopes will be limited to a
maximum of one to six, or one foot of vertical rise for every six feet of
horizontal run.
      (3)   If a proposed construction or development project cannot meet the

flood forces or erosion impacts on the foundation or superstructure of any
building.
      (6)   Man-made alterations of sand dunes within a coastal high hazard
area (Zone V, V1-30, or VE) or within a moderate wave action area are
prohibited unless an engineering report documents that the alterations will not
increase potential flood damage by reducing the wave and flow dissipation
characteristics of the sand dunes.
      (7)   Non-structural fill within a coastal high hazard area (Zone V, V1-
30, or VE) or within a moderate wave action area shall be permitted only if an
engineering report demonstrates that the fill will not cause wave runup,
ramping, or deflection of floodwaters that cause damage to buildings.
      (8)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings within a
coastal high hazard area (Zone V, V1-30, or VE) or within a moderate wave

151.08(D) are met.
   (B)   The Director shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance of
the requirements of §
151.09 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will do any of
the following:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage.
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property.
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that he or she will acknowledge in writing that he or she assumes the risk
and liability.
   (C)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site or
building listed on the National Register of Historical Places or documented as
worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of divisions (A)

(Ord. 1284, passed 8-16-2021)
§ 151.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development, whether inside or outside of the SFHA,
will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on
the part of the village or any officer or employee of the village for any flood
damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made under this chapter.

proposed subdivision.
(1959 Code, § 32-3) (Ord. 1355, passed 4-15-2024)
§ 152.04 MINIMUM CONFORMING STANDARDS REQUIRED.
   Subdivisions shall conform with the following minimum standards.
   (A)   Street system.
      (1)   Access shall be provided to any lot or subdivided parcel within the
subdivision by passage over a public street.
      (2)   The arrangement, widths, courses and extent of the streets shall be
such as to provide at least two lanes for vehicular travel and shall permit
free and unobstructed passage of fire apparatus and of police vehicles.
      (3)   Streets that are in alignment with other streets already existing
and named shall bear the names of the existing streets.
   (B)   Street and alley widths; dead-end streets.
      (1)   The width of public streets shall conform to the width of existing
public streets in the village.
      (2)   Where it is desirable to subdivide land which because of size,
shape or location, does not lend itself to treatment under the usual street
pattern, and where the Plan Commission deems it desirable in the public
interest, access to lots may be provided by means of dead-end streets, not over
300 feet in length and serving not more than four lots. These dead-end streets,
other than those serving one lot only, shall terminate in an open space
preferably circular, having a minimum radius of 55 feet.
      (3)   Alleys shall be provided at the rear of all lots zoned for
commercial use and shall be at least 16 feet wide.
   (C)   Blocks. No block shall be longer than 1,500 feet long between street
lines. Blocks over 750 feet in length shall have a crosswalk near the middle of
the block having a dedicated width of not less than ten feet.
   (D)   Lots.
      (1)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines, or
radial to curved street lines, unless in the judgment of the Plan Commission a
variation of the requirements would enhance public safety or convenience. No
subdivision shall create a through lot or a lot with any lot frontage that is
less than the following distance in the following zoning districts:
 
Zoning District Minimum Lot Frontage (feet)
R-1             75
R-2             65
R-3             40
R-4             40
 
      (2)   Lots held in one ownership of record at the time of the passage of
the zoning ordinance of the village (Ordinance 577), shall not be resubdivided
into lots containing less than the area required by the zoning ordinance in the
district in which the lots are situated, and lots located in the area
designated as the R-l Residence District under the zoning ordinance shall not
be resubdivided into lots of less than 70 feet in width; and the areas shall be
exclusive of property dedicated for or made the subject of easements for public
or private streets or passageways.
   (E)   Easements.
      (1)   Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than five feet
in width shall be provided on each side of the rear lot lines and along side
lot lines where necessary, of each lot, for poles, wires and electric conduits.
      (2)   Easements of a width deemed by the Plan Commission to be adequate,
shall be provided along or across lots where necessary for the extension of any
utilities, including storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water mains, gas mains and
electric poles, wires or conduits.
   (F)   Variations and exceptions. Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of
an unusual size or shape or is surrounded by the development or unusual
conditions that the strict application of any requirement of this chapter would
result in real difficulties and substantial hardships or injustices, the Plan
Commission may recommend to the Village Board, and the Village Board may vary
or modify the requirements to enable subdivision to be made in a reasonable
manner not detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare or convenience.

(1959 Code, § 32-8) (Ord. 1265, passed 9-21-2020)
§ 152.09 FEES AND RECORDING.
   (A)   Fee established; lien. Every application filed pursuant to this
chapter shall be subject to a non-refundable application and filing fee in the
amounts established by resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees from time to
time, plus the actual cost, as hereinafter defined, incurred by the village in
processing the application. The owner of the property which is the subject of
the application and, if different, the applicant, shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of the fee. By signing the application, the
owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the fee and to consent to the
filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to ensure collection
of any fee, plus the costs of collection, which has not been paid within 30
days following the mailing of a written demand for the payment to the owner at
the address shown on the application. Any lien filed pursuant to this
subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or
mechanics liens.
   (B)   Recoverable costs. For purposes of calculating the fee due pursuant to
subsection (A) above, the actual costs incurred by the village in processing an
application shall be deemed to consist of the following items of direct and
indirect expense:
      (1)   Legal publication (direct cost);
      (2)   Recording secretarial services (direct cost);
      (3)   Court reporter (direct cost);
      (4)   Administrative preparation and review (hourly salary times a
multiplier to be established from time to time by the Village Manager at a
level sufficient to recover 100% of the direct and indirect cost of the
service);
      (5)   Document preparation and review (hourly salary times a multiplier
to be established from time to time by the Village Manager at a level
sufficient to recover 100% of the direct and indirect cost of the service);
      (6)   Professional and technical consultant services (direct cost);
      (7)   Legal review, consultation and advice (direct cost);
      (8)   Copy reproduction (direct cost); and
      (9)   Document recordation (direct cost).
   (C)   Fee payment and escrow.
      (1)   Initial payment and escrow. Every application filed pursuant to
this chapter shall be accompanied by the required fee plus an additional amount
for recoverable costs as provided in subsection (B) above, as fixed from time
to time by administrative order of the Village Manager, to be deposited in an
application fee escrow. No interest shall be payable on any escrow.
      (2)   Charges against escrow. From the date of filing of any application
pursuant to this chapter, the village shall maintain an accurate record of the
actual costs, as hereinabove defined, of processing the application. The
Village Manager shall, from time to time, draw funds from the escrow account
established for the application to pay the costs and shall transfer the funds
to the appropriate village accounts. The Manager shall maintain an accurate
record of all drawings.
      (3)   Additional escrow deposits. Should the Village Manager at any time
determine that the escrow account established in connection with any
application is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of
processing the application, the Manager shall inform the applicant of that fact
and demand an additional deposit in an amount deemed by him or her to be
sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and until the
additional amount is deposited by the applicant, the Village Manager may direct
that processing of the application shall be suspended or terminated.
      (4)   Final settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the Village Manager shall cause a final accounting to
be made of the escrow deposits made in connection with the application and the
actual cost of processing the application and shall make a final charge of the
costs against the escrow deposits. A copy of the accounting shall be provided
to the owner and the applicant. If the amount in the escrow account is
insufficient to pay the total actual costs, a written demand for payment of the
balance due shall be mailed to the owner and the applicant. If unused balance
remains in the escrow account after paying the total actual costs, it shall be
returned to the applicant.
   (D)   Condition of all applications, approvals and permits; time periods. No
application filed pursuant to this chapter shall be considered complete unless
and until all fees and deposits due pursuant to this section have been paid.
Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall,
whether or not expressly so conditioned, be deemed to be conditioned upon
payment of fees as required by this section. Where this chapter provides that
the passage of time without decision or action shall be deemed an approval or a
recommendation for approval, time periods shall be tolled during any period of
nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue to run. The failure to fully pay any
fee or deposit, when due, shall be grounds for refusing to process an
application and for denying or revoking any permit or approval sought or issued
with respect to the land or development to which the unpaid fee or deposit
relates.
   (E)   Specified public bodies exempt. The provisions of this section shall
not apply to, and no fee shall be required of, any public body or agency
deriving the majority of its revenues from taxes levied within the village.
(1959 Code, § 32-9) (Ord. 951, passed 4-10-2006)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.

§ 153.034 FENCES.
   (A)   Permit required. No fence shall be constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged or structurally altered upon or within any lot or parcel of ground
within the village unless a permit therefor shall first be obtained from the
Administrative Official. Application for a permit to construct, reconstruct,
enlarge or structurally alter a fence shall be filed with the Village Manager
on forms provided by the village and shall show the height of all parts of the
fence, the materials to be used and other pertinent information and shall be
accompanied by a map or drawing showing the location of the proposed fence and
other structures on the lot as well as any existing fence along the same lot
line on an adjacent lot. A fee shall be paid for each permit issued, in an
amount as the Board of Trustees shall, by resolution, establish from time to
time.
   (B)   Regulation. No fence shall be constructed, reconstructed, repaired,
enlarged or structurally altered, and no permit therefor shall be issued by the
Administrative Official, unless the fence conforms to the requirements of this
section.
   (C)   Materials; construction. The design and construction of a fence shall
be compatible with the appearance and character of the neighboring properties
in the village. High quality materials and installation exhibiting clean lines
and structural integrity are required. No fence shall be erected or maintained
on any lot within the minimum front yard required for the lot by the zoning
regulations, or, in the case of a side yard abutting a street, within the
minimum side yard required for the lot by the zoning regulations, or otherwise
along the street frontage line or lines of the lot, or along the side lot line
or lines between the lot and the lot of another and within the street frontage
setback area required for the lot by the zoning regulations, unless:
      (1)   If constructed of masonry, the fence is constructed with open areas
equivalent to at least 30% of each square foot thereof;
      (2)   If constructed of materials other than masonry, the fence is
constructed with open areas equivalent to at least 60% of each square foot
thereof (exclusive of parts needed for structural support); or
      (3)   If the fence is constructed of wire, wire mesh or similar
materials, visibility of the fence from public ways is minimized by a natural
screen of sufficient height and density so as to render the fence inconspicuous
to an observer from public ways during all seasons of the year.
   (D)   Fences in front yards. No fence exceeding four feet in height shall be
erected or maintained on any lot within the minimum front yard required for the
lot by the zoning regulations, or in the case of a side yard abutting a street,
within the minimum side yard required for the lot by the zoning regulations, or
otherwise along the street frontage line or lines of any lot, or along the side
lot line or lines between any lot and the lot of another and within the street
frontage setback area required by the zoning regulations.
   (E)   Fences in side or rear yards.
      (1)   No fence exceeding six feet in height shall be erected or
maintained on any lot within the minimum side or rear yard required for the lot
by the zoning regulations or along the side or rear lot lines between any lot
and the lot of another. However, no fence along the side or rear lot line of
any lot shall exceed, at any point, the actual highest point (excluding
decorative elements permitted under subsection (F) below) of any portion of any
existing fence along the same lot line on an adjacent lot unless the owner of
the adjacent lot shall have given written consent (in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Official) to the construction of a higher
fence.
      (2)   Notwithstanding whether or not the consent of the owner of the
adjacent lot has been given, minor deviations by a fence from the actual
highest point of any portion of an existing fence along the same lot line shall
be disregarded as necessary to allow installation of the fence with a uniform,
continuous profile over minor irregularities in the surface of the soil
directly beneath the fence, provided that:
         (a)   No deviation shall affect more than 10% in linear footage
(whether or not continuous) of the fence;
         (b)   No deviation from the actual highest point of any portion of the
existing fence shall exceed three inches; and
         (c)   No deviation shall be permitted in any case where the natural
grade of the surface of the soil has been raised or altered in order to avoid
limitations on permitted height that would otherwise be applicable to a fence.
   (F)   Height determined.
      (1)   The height of any fence shall be measured from the average of the
measurements from ground level on each side of the fence to the tallest point
of any structural, decorative or other element incorporated into the fence
(excluding decorative elements permitted under this subsection). Where there is
no existing fence along the same side or rear lot line, minor deviations from
the maximum permitted height of a fence shall be disregarded as necessary to
allow installation of the fence with a uniform, continuous profile over minor
irregularities in the surface of the soil directly beneath the fence, provided
that:
         (a)   No deviation shall affect more than 25% in linear footage
(whether or not continuous) of the fence;
         (b)   No deviation from the maximum permitted height shall exceed six
inches; and
         (c)   No deviation shall be permitted in any case where the natural
grade of the surface of the soil has been raised or altered in order to avoid
limitations on permitted height that would otherwise be applicable to a fence.
      (2)   Decorative elements, such as finials, on posts required for
structural support may extend to a height of up to six inches in excess of the
maximum height or tallest point allowed in this section for the fence or
portion thereof supported by the posts.
   (G)   Installation. The “finished side” of a fence on any part of a lot
abutting a street or public way shall face the street. The “finished side” of a
fence on any part of a lot abutting an adjoining property shall face the
adjoining property unless there is already a fence on the adjoining property.
For purposes of this subsection the “finished side” of a fence shall be deemed
to be the side not showing structural supports or the side designed or intended
to be the most attractive in appearance. If revealed structural supports are an
integral part of the design of the fence, the structural supports must be
centered on the line of the fence or equally visible on each side of the fence.
   (H)   Nonconforming fences. It is declared to be in the public interest and
the intent of this section to permit any fence lawfully existing as of the
effective date of this section but which fails to conform to this section to
continue to exist until removed or terminated, but not to encourage the
survival or the enlargement or expansion thereof. Pending the removal of any
nonconforming fence or the alteration thereof so as to conform to this section,
no nonconforming fence shall be structurally altered or enlarged so as to
increase the extent of any nonconformity. If any nonconforming fence is
damaged, destroyed or deteriorated by any means, so as to require replacement
or substantial restoration, the nonconforming fence shall not be rebuilt or
restored unless the fence, as rebuilt or restored, shall conform to the
requirements of this section. Ordinary repairs, maintenance or replacement of
parts of any nonconforming fence, other than structural supports, may be
undertaken.
   (I)   Exceptions. It is hereby declared to be in the public interest to
encourage the preservation of old wrought iron fences and masonry gate posts
and corner posts; any wrought iron fence and any masonry gate posts and corner
posts may be replaced, reconstructed or repaired substantially in accordance
with the original dimensions and design thereof notwithstanding any contrary
provision of this section. The provisions of this section shall not apply to
property in districts designated M-2, P or S. The maximum permitted height for
any fence located on any lot along a rear or side yard lot line and adjacent to
any property in districts designated M-2, P or S shall be one foot in excess of
the maximum height otherwise stipulated in this section for the fence,
notwithstanding any contrary provision of this section.
   (J)   Fence defined. For the purposes of this section, the following
definition shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      FENCE. Includes any barrier or wall of posts, rails, gates and/or other
members constructed of wood, metal, wire, masonry and/or other materials,
placed or used in whole or in part as a boundary or as an ornamental feature or
as means of protection, security, privacy or confinement, or otherwise serving
the functions commonly ascribed to a fence, but shall not include any wall
constructed of timbers, masonry or other materials for the principal purpose of
maintaining a terrace or controlling erosion; or any natural growing hedge,
shrub or other plant life.
   (K)   Natural vegetation in front yards.
      (1)   No natural growing hedge, shrub or other plant life that is placed
or used in whole or in part as a boundary or barrier and as a means of
protection or confinement with a height in excess of four feet shall be located
within eight feet of:
         (a)   1.   The front lot line;
            2.   Any side lot line abutting a street;
            3.   The interior line of the corner sight triangle on the lot,
with any hedge, shrub or other plant life along the line to be equally
allocated to the front lot line and side lot line abutting a street; or
            4.   The interior line of any driveway sight triangle on the lot,
with any hedge shrub or other plant life along the line to be allocated to the
lot line on which the sight triangle is located, for a distance extending more
than 30% of the front lot line or the side lot line, respectively.
         (b)   The side lot lines not abutting a street for a distance
extending more than 30% of the side lot line within the required front yard or
required side yard abutting a street.
      (2)   The distance of eight feet shall be measured from the centerline of
the hedge, shrub or other plant life to the applicable lot line or interior
line. This limitation shall not apply to the front yards or side yards of lots
abutting Ridge Road or Sheridan Road. Any vegetation existing on the lot as of
February 24, 2006 shall be considered legal nonconforming uses and,
notwithstanding §§
153.205 through
153.211, the vegetation may be replaced only if less than 75% of the vegetation
boundary or barrier is damaged or destroyed.

PART B. KENILWORTH SIGN CODE
§ 153.045 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The following statement of purpose and intent is hereby adopted:
   (A)   The purpose of this part is to:
      (1)   Establish a comprehensive system of sign regulation which
accommodates and balances the need for a well-maintained, safe and attractive
community with the need for effective communication and business identification
within the village as an important means by which to preserve the village as a
desirable community in which to live and do business.
      (2)   Encourage high quality and excellence in the design of signs
throughout the village so as to promote and enhance the beauty and aesthetic
character of the residential neighborhoods and protect residential property
values.
      (3)   Encourage high quality and excellence in the design of signs in the
“B” Business District to promote and enhance the village’s ability to attract
new sources of economic development and protect property values in the “B”
Business District.
      (4)   Promote the public health, safety and general welfare through
reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign regulations.
   (B)   This part is further and more specifically intended to:
      (1)   Protect, conserve and enhance the natural beauty of village
landscape, parks and beaches and the aesthetic quality of the village’s
tranquil and historic residential neighborhoods, so as to preserve the unique
character of the community and to protect property values within the village.
      (2)   Establish standards relating to the time, manner, placement and
physical characteristics of signs within the village to ensure that they are
adequate to meet essential communication needs within the village while
safeguarding the rights of the public and individual residents to a safe,
healthful and attractive environment free of visual clutter or litter.
      (3)   Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning
district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use and
function to which they pertain.
      (4)   Protect community aesthetics and property values by ensuring that
signs are in harmony with nearby buildings, neighborhoods and conforming signs
and by precluding signs that create a nuisance to the nearby properties or
neighborhoods as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness or
movement.
      (5)   Encourage the pedestrian-friendly nature of the village’s single,
small business district and enhance the aesthetics of the business district by
curtailing the size, height and number of signs and regulating the design,
quality and quantity of graphic sign elements to the minimum necessary to
identify business locations and the nature of the businesses.
      (6)   Restrict signs which distract or obstruct the vision of motorists,
bicyclists and pedestrians in the “B” Business District, so as to minimize
unsafe visual or auditory distractions that might otherwise arise from the
unnecessary or confusing proliferation or placement of signs or from the
excessive illumination, height, size, movement or noise of signs competing for
the attention of motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists.
      (7)   Ensure that all signs in the “B” Business District are proportioned
to the scale of, and are architecturally compatible with, existing land use,
buildings and nearby residential neighborhoods.
      (8)   Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent
possible, signs that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of adjacent
properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness or
movement.
      (9)   Preserve the historically subtle and understated lighting present
throughout the village by regulating sign illumination.
      (10)   Protect the right to express non-commercial opinions in all zoning
districts, subject to balanced and reasonable restrictions on the size, height,
location, timing and number of signs so as to safeguard the right of all
residents to a safe, healthful and attractive environment free of visual
clutter.
      (11)   Regulate the secondary effects of speech insofar as they adversely
affect community aesthetics and traffic, and bicycle and pedestrian safety,
rather than to censor speech or regulate viewpoints.
      (12)   Assure that all signs in the village are designed, constructed,
installed, and maintained in safe condition, and that portable, disposable
temporary signs do not become unsightly litter or pose a hazard to traffic or
pedestrians.

DISTRICTS.
   The following general regulations and standards shall apply to all allowed
signs in all zoning districts:
   (A)   Responsibility for compliance. The responsibility for compliance with
this part rests jointly and severally upon the sign owner, all parties holding
the present right of possession and control of the lot on which a sign is
located, mounted, installed or displayed, and the owner of the lot.
   (B)   Owner’s consent. No sign may be placed on private property without the
consent of the owner of the lot, and such occupants that owner may have
provided with the right to consent by agreement or contract.
   (C)   Restrictions on signs on public property. No signs may be erected upon
public property, with the exception of governmental signs, public utility
signs, and such other signs specifically authorized by the village. Any sign
placed on public property without authorization is an illegal sign under this
part and may be summarily removed by the village without notice.
   (D)   Message substitution. Subject to the lot owner’s consent, a
noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for
any commercial message or any other noncommercial message on a currently
existing sign, including a legal nonconforming sign, without consideration of
message content, provided that the sign structure is legal. Such substitution
of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This
provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a
lot, nor does it alter or waive the requirement that a sign have a building
permit and a certificate of appropriateness.
   (E)   Logo size. A logo on a sign is limited to no more than 15% of the
total sign area.
   (F)   Building and construction requirements. All signs shall comply with
the building and construction regulations and shall be designed and constructed
adequately and safely to support their weight and to withstand wind and other
stresses to which they may be subjected. Supports and braces shall be an
integral part of the sign design. All signs attached to a building shall be
installed and maintained so that wall penetrations are watertight and the
structure does not exceed allowable stresses of supporting materials. All
fasteners used to attach signs to a structure or building shall be properly
sized for the design loads and material of the support, have a minimum cross-
section diameter of one-quarter inch, and be made of corrosion resistant
material.
   (G)   Obstruction of access ways. No sign shall be located, erected,
installed, relocated, maintained, enlarged, expanded or otherwise permitted to
obstruct or prevent free ingress and egress from any window, door, fire escape
or stairway of any building or structure, or to obstruct light or ventilation
required by the building and construction regulations. No sign shall be
attached to an external fire escape.
   (H)   Traffic safety. No sign shall be located, erected, used, displayed,
enlarged, expanded, constructed, maintained or illuminated in such a manner
that it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any
authorized traffic sign, signal or device, or otherwise cause a safety hazard,
nuisance or distraction to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including the
requirements of §§
153.075 and
153.099 of this chapter.
   (I)   Sign measurement.
      (1)   Computation of sign area. Sign area is calculated as follows:
         (a)   For signs on a background, the entire area of the background
shall be included in the calculation of the sign area, including any material
or color forming the sign face or background used to differentiate the sign
from the structure against which it is placed. Sign area does not include any
supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of
the message or sign face.
         (b)   For a sign consisting of freestanding letters, graphics, logos,
images or symbols, the sign area is calculated by means of the smallest square,
circle, rectangle or triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the
outer limits of the freestanding letters, graphics, logos, images or symbols.
Sign area does not include any supporting framework or bracing, unless such
framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face. Window signs printed
on a transparent film and affixed to a window pane shall be considered
freestanding letters, graphics, logos, images or symbols, provided that the
portion of the transparent film around the perimeter of the sign message
maintains the transparent character of the window and does not contain any
items in the sign message.
         (c)   Any sign wording, illustration or element that is less than two
feet from any other sign wording, illustration or element shall be considered
shall be considered a single sign for purposes of calculating sign area. No
sign shall be nearer than two feet to any other sign or structure which is on
the same plane, other than a structure to which it is lawfully attached.
         (d)   When a sign has more than one display face, all faces shall be
included in determining the sign area, provided that, if the sign faces of a
two-faced sign are parallel and the distance between them does not exceed 12
inches, the sign area shall be measured as the area of one face.
         (e)   The sign area of free-form or sculptural (non-planar) signs is
calculated as 50% of the sum of the area of the four vertical sides of the
smallest cube that will encompass the sign.
      (2)   Measurement of sign height. When measuring sign height, the height
of the sign structure is included.
         (a)   The sign height of freestanding and monument signs shall be
measured from the unaltered, unimproved natural ground level and/or sidewalk
adjacent to the sign to the top of the sign and/or sign structure.
         (b)   The sign height of projecting signs shall be measured from the
unaltered, unimproved natural ground level and/or sidewalk under the sign to
the top of the sign, exclusive of decorative braces.
      (3)   Measurement of front façade. For purposes of calculating the
combined sign area allowed in §
153.052, the area of the occupant’s front façade shall be measured as follows:
         (a)   Single story building. The area of the front façade of an
occupant’s space in a single story building shall be measured in square feet by
multiplying the horizontal width of occupant’s space by the vertical distance
of the occupant’s space measured from ground level to the lowest point of the
roof, but in no case shall such vertical distance exceed 14 feet in height.
         (b)   Multistory building. The area of the front façade of an
occupant’s space in a multistory building shall be measured in square feet by
multiplying the horizontal width of the occupant’s space by the vertical
distance of the occupant’s space measured from ground level to the bottom of
the sill of the second story window, but in no case shall such vertical
distance exceed 14 feet measured from ground level.
   (J)   Sign illumination. In all zoning districts, sign illumination is
limited to allowed exterior illuminated signs. All other illuminated signs are
prohibited signs.
      (1)   Location and design of light source. The lights for exterior
illuminated signs shall be located, shielded and directed in such a manner that
the light source is not directly visible from any surrounding public or private
property. The use of unshielded lights, including incandescent bulbs on poles
or strung on poles, wires or any other type of support to illuminate a sign is
not allowed. All receptacles or devices used to provide external illumination
for wall signs shall not protrude more than nine inches from the face of the
sign except for ground lighting.
      (2)   Hours of illumination. Illumination for an exterior illuminated
sign is allowed from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., except that an exterior
illuminated sign may remain illuminated during such time as the business is
open to the general public, so long as such sign is not a public or private
nuisance and in no case later than 11:00 p.m.
      (3)   Level of illumination. The lighting intensity of an exterior
illuminated sign shall not exceed, and shall be maintained at or less than ten
foot candles when measured with a standard light meter at four feet from the
center of the face of the sign.

increase the degree of its nonconformity, be enlarged or expanded, be
structurally altered to prolong its useful life, or be moved in whole or in
part to any other location where it would remain nonconforming. A change in
sign message which does not otherwise violate the provisions of this part shall
not be deemed to be prohibited by this §
153.058.
   (E)   Restoring nonconformity prohibited. A legal nonconforming sign that
has been changed to eliminate its nonconformity or any element of its
nonconformity shall not thereafter be changed to restore such nonconformity or
nonconforming element.
   (F)   Damage or destruction of a legal nonconforming sign. A legal
nonconforming sign, or any nonconforming element of a legal nonconforming sign
capable of change or discontinuance separate from other elements of the sign,
damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 35% of its
replacement cost new shall not be restored but shall be removed or brought into
conformity with the provisions of this code.
   (G)   Abandonment of a legal nonconforming sign. Any legal nonconforming

appropriateness, in a safe and secure condition, and in a neat and orderly
condition and good working order at all times, and to prevent the development
of any rust, corrosion, rotting or other deterioration in the physical
appearance or safety of such sign. The premises around monument and
freestanding signs shall be kept clean and free of all rubbish and weeds. It
shall be unlawful to have an abandoned sign, dilapidated sign, unsafe sign or
vandalized sign on any property in the village.
   (B)   Condition of permanent signs generally. Permanent signs shall be
periodically repainted or otherwise maintained to prevent corrosion or
deterioration caused by the weather, age or any other condition, and to keep

the Administrative Official may require the owner of the sign, and the owner of
the building, structure or lot on which the unsafe sign is attached or erected,
if different, to repair or remove the sign within seven days following notice
of such violation. If the Administrative Official finds that any sign is so
unsafe or improperly secured or structurally unsound, or is in danger of
falling, or presents any kind of fire or electrical safety or shock hazard, or
is otherwise a menace to the public, or is otherwise in such hazardous
condition that immediate action is warranted, the village may notify, by
whatever means is practical, the parties entitled to notice under this
provision and direct the immediate removal of the sign or other action to abate
the hazard.
   (E)   Vandalized signs. The Administrative Official shall send written
notice to the owner of any vandalized sign, and to the owner of the building,
structure or lot on which the vandalized sign is attached or erected, if
different, of the condition(s) of the sign which are deemed to make it a
vandalized sign. A vandalized sign must be brought into compliance with the all
applicable provisions within 14 days following notice of such violation.

to the owner of any abandoned sign, and to the owner of the building, structure

days following notice of such violation.

this code to ascertain whether the sign structure is in conformance with the

      (1)   Illegal permanent sign. A permanent sign which has been located,
erected, used, displayed, constructed, installed, enlarged, expanded, altered,
operated, maintained, relocated or removed in violation of this part, this
chapter, or other applicable law is an illegal sign. Upon written notice by the
Administrative Official to the owner of the Illegal sign that such sign is in

      (2)   Illegal temporary sign. If any temporary, short-term temporary or

of the unlawful sign. Prior written notice of a violation shall not be required
for the initiation of enforcement actions under this section if the violation
creates an emergency or unsafe condition.
   (E)   Liability for damages, private remedies. Neither the provisions of
this code nor the issuance of any building permit or certificate of
appropriateness shall be construed as relieving any person erecting, owning or
maintaining any sign from liability arising by reason of, or personal injury or
property damage resulting from such sign, or work relating to such sign, or as
limiting the liability of any such person by reason of personal injury or
property damage so resulting. Nothing in this part shall be interpreted to
prevent any person entitled to relief in law or equity by reason of a violation
of the provisions of this chapter from bringing an appropriate action to secure
such relief.
   (F)   Complaints regarding violations. Whenever a violation of this part
occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written
complaint. Such complaint stating fully the causes and basis thereof shall be
filed with the Administrative Official. He or she shall record properly and

§ 153.187 PARKING AREAS AND DRIVEWAYS.
   (A)   Location. Parking spaces required for single-family dwellings, single-
family attached dwellings or multiple-family dwellings shall be located on the
same lot as the dwelling or dwellings served. Parking spaces required for all
other buildings may be located on the same lot or within 500 feet of the lot on
which the building is located. All parking spaces, parking areas and garages
shall be so located and designed as to provide vehicular access to adjacent
streets and alleys with the least interference with through traffic movements.
   (B)   Parking areas separate from principal building. Only parking areas
open to the sky may be used to satisfy the off-street facilities parking
requirements when the parking facilities are to be constructed on a separate
lot or parcel of land which is removed from the site of the principal building
which requires the parking facilities. This provision shall not apply in a
business district or other district where a public garage for the storage of
private automobiles and vehicles is a permitted use.
   (C)   Plot plan showing location of parking area. No application for a
building permit for a new, enlarged or altered structure or improvement or use
shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for the structure or
improvement or use a plot plan drawn to scale, showing the required off-street
automobile parking facilities in accordance with the conditions specified
herein; nor shall a permit be issued for the improvement of a parking area to
serve as an accessory use to an existing building or buildings until a plot
plan, drawn to scale, has been submitted in accordance with the provisions
contained herein.
   (D)   Location of off-street parking and driveways in yards. Within the
maximum number of spaces allowed, off-street parking spaces may be located in
rear yards and side yards, subject, in the case of lots in residence districts,
to the restrictions stated in §
153.080, but in no case shall they be located in any front yard; provided,
however, that driveways serving single-family dwellings and single-family
attached dwellings and driveways providing direct access from a garage or
parking area to a street or alley (and not serving as a circulation aisle in
connection with any parking space) may traverse any required yard. Permanent
off-street parking shall not be located in the portion of a driveway that
traverses the front yard.
   (E)   Private garages; driveways located below grade. Except in the B
Business District, no building or part of a building shall be constructed or
structurally altered to create any private garage or other place for the
storage or parking of automobiles if any part of an automobile stored or parked
in the space would be below the natural, unaltered adjoining grade of the lot
on which the building is situated. Except in the B Business District, no part
of any driveway or other impervious surface leading to a private garage shall
be constructed so the surface thereof is below the natural, unaltered adjoining
grade of the lot on which it is situated, except to the extent that the
Administrative Official shall have determined that the topography of the lot
requires all or any part of the driveway to be below the natural, unaltered
adjoining grade of the lot and the driveway would not present undue risks to
public safety or create excessive additional burdens upon village sewer systems
for drainage of stormwater.

space in relation to the uses served are observed. But no parking space, or
portion thereof, shall serve as the required space for more than one use.
   (B)   Control of parking areas. Where required parking facilities are
provided off the site of the principal building or structure generating the
need for parking facilities in accordance with the provisions of this section,
the land upon which the parking facilities are located, or to be located, shall
be in the same possession, either by deed or long term lease, as the property
occupied by the use to which the parking facilities are auxiliary, in which
case the owner of the land shall be bound by covenants filed of record in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds or the Registrar of Titles of the county,

doors on both sides, together with properly related access to a public street
or alley and maneuvering room. Required off-street parking areas for three or
more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked, and shall be so

to parking shall be on any public street, walk or alley, and so that any
automobile may be parked and unparked without moving another. Tandem parking is
permitted in the B Business District for multiple-family dwellings.

NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 153.205 INTENT.
   (A)   Within the districts established by this chapter or by future
amendment hereof, there may exist lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which are lawfully existing at the time of passage of this chapter
or an amendment, but which are or would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
by this chapter or the amendment. It is the intent of this subchapter to permit
these lawfully existing nonconformities (herein referred to as
“nonconformities”) to continue until they are removed or terminated, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this subchapter that the
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, not be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. Any structure or use which is not lawfully existing at the time of
passage of this chapter or any future amendment hereto and which is in conflict
with the requirements of this chapter or an amendment shall remain unlawful
under this chapter or an amendment.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a
structure, of land or of structure and land in combination shall not be
extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by the addition of other
uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (C)   Non-conforming signs shall be governed by this section and §§
153.030 through
153.060 of this chapter.

§ 153.206 NONCONFORMING LOT IN RESIDENCE DISTRICT.
   (A)   In any residence district, notwithstanding regulations imposed by
other provisions of this chapter, a single-family dwelling or an addition
thereto and customary accessory buildings, all of which comply with subsection
(B) below, may be constructed on a lot consisting entirely of a tract of land
that:
      (1)   Has less than the prescribed minimum lot size;
      (2)   Is shown by a recorded or registered plat or deed to have been
owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when
the creation of a lot of the size at the same location would not have been
prohibited by any zoning ordinance; and
      (3)   Has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining
tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of the lot
has been prohibited by the applicable zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Construction permitted by subsection (A) above shall comply with all
regulations (except minimum lot area) that are generally applicable in the
district in which the lot is located, subject only to variances, if any, as
shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Appeals.
   (C)   If two or more lots of record or combinations of lots of record and
portions of lots of record, with continuous frontage, are in single ownership
at April 14, 1969 or at any time thereafter, and if all or part of the lots do
not meet the requirements established for lot area in the residence district in
which they are located, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for purposes of this chapter, and no portion of the parcel
shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot area
requirements established for the district by this chapter, nor shall any
division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with an area below the
requirements stated in this chapter for the district.
(Ord. 577, passed 4-14-1969)
§ 153.207 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter lawful use of land
exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter
or an amendment, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, provided:
   (A)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the date of passage or
amendment of this chapter;
   (B)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion
of the land other than that occupied by the use at the date of passage or
amendment of this chapter;
   (C)   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
more than 30 days, any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the
regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the land is
located; and
   (D)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
chapter shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land.
(Ord. 577, passed 4-14-1969)
§ 153.208 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES USED FOR A PERMITTED USE.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the time of passage or amendment of this
chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter or an amendment
by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on
the lot or other requirements concerning the structure, the structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions.
   (A)   The structure may be enlarged, repaired or structurally altered,
provided that no enlargement, repair or alteration shall either create an
additional nonconformity or increase the extent of any existing nonconformity.
   (B)   If the nonconforming structure is located in any district other than
Districts R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 and is damaged or destroyed by any means to an
extent of more than 75% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the regulations for the
district in which it is located.
   (C)   If the nonconforming structure is located in Districts R-1, R-2, R-
3 or R-4 and is damaged or destroyed to an extent of more than 75% of its
replacement cost at the time of its destruction, by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof, such as fire, flood, earthquake, tornado or other
acts of God, it may be reconstructed to the same size and location as was
existing prior to the damage or destruction; provided, however, that the
structure was lawfully existing at the time of its construction and no repair,
restoration or reconstruction shall be made that would create an additional
nonconformity or increase the extent of any nonconformity existing at the time
of destruction.

§ 153.209 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If lawful use of structures or of structures and land in combination exists
at the date of passage or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed
in the district in which located under the terms of this chapter or an
amendment, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No structure shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or
structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (B)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
passage or amendment of this chapter, but no use shall be extended to occupy
any land outside the building.
   (C)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes
access to the premises), the structure or structure and land in combination,
shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   (E)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. For this purpose, DESTRUCTION is defined as
damage to an extent of more than 75% of the replacement cost at time of
destruction.
(Ord. 577, passed 4-14-1969)
§ 153.210 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when the structure became nonconforming shall not be
increased.
   (B)   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs
and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe
or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be
restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which it is located.
   (C)   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening

be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order
of the official.

and ordering the action necessary to correct it. He or she shall order
discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or other structures; removal
of illegal buildings or other structures or of illegal additions, alterations
or structural changes; and discontinuance of any illegal work being done. He or
she shall take any other action authorized by this chapter to ensure compliance

§ 153.226 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.
   (A)   No change in the use of land or of an existing building shall be made,
no building constructed, structurally altered or moved after the date of
passage of this chapter shall be occupied, and no land vacant on the date of
passage of this chapter shall be used for any purpose, until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Administrative Official stating that the
building and the proposed use thereof, or the proposed use of vacant land, as
the case may be, conforms to applicable building and health laws and ordinances
and to this chapter; provided, however, that a temporary certificate of
compliance may be issued by the Administrative Official for a period of not
more than six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building
pending completion, which temporary certificate may contain conditions and
safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public.
   (B)   Every application for a building permit shall be deemed to be an
application for a certificate of compliance. Every application for a
certificate of compliance for a new use of land where no building permit is
required shall be made directly to the Administrative Official. An application
for a certificate of compliance shall be issued or denied, as may be
appropriate, within 15 days after receipt by the Administrative Official of
written notice of completion of the construction, alteration or moving of the
building to which the application relates, or within ten days after his or her
receipt of the application if it relates to a new use of land where no building
permit is required.
   (C)   No nonconforming structure or use shall be renewed, changed or
extended until a certificate of compliance shall have been issued by the
Administrative Official; provided that within one year from the date of passage
of this chapter (or of any amendment hereto which causes a structure or use to
become nonconforming) owners or occupants of any premises with respect to which
any nonconforming structure or use exists may apply for a certificate of
compliance. The certificate of compliance shall state specifically that the
structure or use is nonconforming and the particulars in which the
nonconforming structure or use differs from the requirements of this chapter.
Failure to make the application within one year shall be presumptive evidence
that no nonconformity as to structure or use existed with respect to the
property at the time of passage of this chapter or an amendment and that any
noncompliance of the structure or use with the requirements of this chapter
occurred after the time of its passage.
   (D)   The Administrative Official shall maintain a record of all
certificates of compliance, and a copy shall be furnished upon request to any
person.
   (E)   Failure to obtain a certificate of compliance in connection with any
renewal, extension or change of a nonconforming structure or use shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable as provided by §
153.999.

PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE.
   Certificates of compliance issued on the basis of plans and applications
approved by the Administrative Official authorize only the use, arrangement and
construction set forth in the approved plans and applications, and no other
use, arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement or construction at
variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter, and
punishable as provided by §
153.999.

      (3)   To review applications for permanent signs that are not exempt
signs under §§
153.045 through

(Ord. 1057, passed 2-22-2011)
§ 153.242 CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificate required for certain buildings, structures and signs. No
building or other permit otherwise required under any ordinance of the village
for any of the following shall be issued by the appropriate village official
except upon the granting of a certificate of appropriateness by the
Architectural Review Commission:
      (1)   The erection, construction, alteration or repair of any building or
structure in any non-residential district of the village or any residential
district of the village that is also subject to a special use; provided,
however, that no certificate of appropriateness will be required if the
Building Commissioner makes a determination that in any non-residential
district and for any special use in any residential district, the appearance
plan does not apply, and, in the Business District, the Kenilworth Design
Guidelines—Business District do not apply, to the work for which the building
or other permit is being sought; and
      (2)   The location, erection, use, display, construction, installation,
enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation or repair of any permanent sign
as defined in, and not exempt sign under §§
153.045 through
153.060.
   A certificate of appropriateness is deemed to authorize only the particular
building, structure or sign at the specific location for which it was issued
and shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such
building, structure or sign shall be removed or relocated.
   (B)   Special procedures in connection with other applications. Whenever any
application for a special use or planned unit development is filed pursuant to
this chapter as a companion to an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, and such companion application requires approval by the Board
of Trustees, the authority to hear and decide the application for certificate
of appropriateness otherwise delegated to the Architectural Review Commission
pursuant to this section shall be reserved to the Board of Trustees. For such
purposes, the Board of Trustees shall have all of the authority granted to, and
shall be subject to all of the limitations imposed on, the Architectural Review
Commission by this section; provided, however, that the provisions governing
public notice and hearing of, and action on, the application for special use or
planned unit development of this ordinance shall govern.
   (C)   Standards for certificates of appropriateness for buildings and
structures. The Architectural Review Commission shall grant a certificate of
appropriateness for the erection, construction, alteration or repair of any
building or structure in any non-residential district of the village that is in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of the standards set forth in the
ordinances, codes and regulations of the village and, in any non-residential
district and for any special use in any residential district, the appearance
plan, and, in the Business District, the Kenilworth Design Guidelines—Business
District, which are incorporated in and made a part of this chapter as
Appendices A and
C, respectively . In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the
Kenilworth Design Guidelines —Business District and the remaining provisions of
this chapter, the provision that is the most restrictive or imposes the higher
standard shall govern and control.
   (D)   Standards for certificates of appropriateness for signs. The
Architectural Review Commission shall grant a certificate of appropriateness
for the location, erection, use, display, construction, installation,
enlargement, expansion, alteration, operation or repair of any permanent sign
as defined in, and not exempt under, §§
153.045 through
153.060 that is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the standards
set forth in the ordinances, codes, and regulations of the village, and, in any
non- residential district and for any special use in any residential district,
the appearance plan, and, in the Business District, the Kenilworth Design
Guidelines —Business District, and the standards of §
153.052(C).
   (E)   Application for certificate of appropriateness. All applications for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be subject to the standards and procedures
established in §§
153.240 through
153.249.
   (F)   Pre-application conference. Prior to filing an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, the prospective applicant may request an
informal conference with the Administrative Official to discuss the proposed
application. The pre-application conference does not require either the payment
of an application fee or the filing of an application.
   (G)   Procedures for certificate of appropriateness approval.
      (1)   Application review. Upon receipt of a properly completed
application for approval of a certificate of appropriateness, the
Administrative Official shall review the application for compliance with all
applicable requirements. Completed applications will then be forwarded to the
Architectural Review Commission for a public hearing.
      (2)   Public hearing. The Architectural Review Commission shall hold a
public hearing on an application for a certificate of appropriateness no later
than 60 days after receiving a properly completed application from the
Administrative Official. The hearing shall be concluded not later than 120 days
following the receipt of a completed application unless the applicant shall
agree to an extension. Notice for the public hearing shall be issued in the
manner provided in §
153.249.
      (3)   Findings of fact; decision. After the close of the public hearing,
the Commission shall make findings of fact in support of its decision to grant
or deny a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the standards set
forth in this chapter. The Commission shall make its decision issuing, issuing
with conditions, or denying the certificate of appropriateness. The Commission
shall specify in its decision such conditions that it deems necessary to assure
the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare, and the compatibility
with the surrounding neighborhood and community. The decision shall be issued
within 30 days after the close of the public hearing and be forwarded to the
Administrative Official.
      (4)   Required vote. The Commission shall not approve a certificate of
appropriateness except on the concurring vote of a majority of the members of
the Commission present at the meeting. The Commission shall not deny a
certificate of appropriateness except on the concurring vote of four members of
the Commission.
      (5)   Effect of decision. The decision of the Commission on an
application for a certificate of appropriateness will be the final decision of
the village. In the event of denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the
applicant shall have the right to appeal the decision in the Circuit Court of
Cook County in the manner provided by law.
   (H)   Amendments to certificates of appropriateness.
      (1)   Major changes.
         (a)   Procedure for major changes. An applicant seeking a major change
after a certificate of appropriateness has been approved shall seek an
amendment to the certificate by submitting a new application and following the
procedures for approval, as established in this section. Major changes to an
approved certificate of appropriateness may be granted only by the Commission
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section.
         (b)   Major changes defined. All changes other than minor changes.
      (2)   Minor changes.
         (a)   Procedure for minor changes. A proposed minor change after a
certificate of appropriateness has been approved may be presented directly to
the Administrative Official for consideration in the event of extenuating and/
or unforeseen circumstances. The Administrative Official may approve minor
changes memorialized in a written document which shall be forwarded to the
Commission.
         (b)   Minor changes defined. Minor changes shall include changes in
specified materials or structural components due to product discontinuance or
unavailability or the like, with no change in quality.
   (I)   Duration, expiration and removal.
      (1)   No certificate of appropriateness shall be effective for a period
longer than 12 months unless a building permit is obtained and the erection,
construction, alteration or repair of the building or structure, or the
location, erection, display, construction, installation, enlargement,
expansion, alteration, operation, or repair of the sign covered by the
certificate, has commenced within that period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion. The Administrative Official may, upon written request of
the applicant, extend this time limit for a period not to exceed an additional
six months if the Administrative Official deems such extension to be
appropriate and necessary to avoid undue hardship to the applicant. The
applicant must submit a written request for an extension to the Administrative
Official prior to the expiration of the certificate of appropriateness. Any
such extension shall be made only after payment of the appropriate fee.
      (2)   The right to extend said time limit shall not include the right to
request additional relief or amendment to or expansion of the scope of the
certificate of appropriateness. If a certificate of appropriateness expires,
the applicant must reapply for a new certificate of appropriateness and such
re-application shall be treated as a new application.

filing with the Administrative Official and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Administrative Official shall forthwith
transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the
decision appealed from was taken.
   (B)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the decision appealed from unless the Administrative Official
certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal has been filed with him or
her that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his
or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case the
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the
Administrative Official and on due cause shown.
   (C)   Hearing, notice and decision. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
and place for the hearing for appeal, give public notice thereof as well as due
notice to the parties in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable
time. Any party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or attorney.
With the concurring vote of four members, the Board may, as long as its action
is in conformity with this chapter, reverse or affirm in whole or in part or
modify the decision from which the appeal was taken, and to that end the Board
shall have all the powers of the Administrative Official with respect to the
decision.
   (D)   Maintenance of records. The Administrative Official shall maintain
complete records of all actions of the Board relative to appeals, and shall
cause the Board of Trustees to be kept informed on a current basis of the
disposition of each appeal.

§ 153.244 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (A)(2) below, the Board shall
grant variances from the regulations of this chapter in harmony with their
general purpose and intent, only in the specific instances hereinafter set
forth, where the Board makes a finding of fact based upon the standards
hereinafter presented, that there are practical difficulties or particular
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations.
      (2)   A variation application for a property located in the B Business
Zoning District that is eligible for review by the Plan Commission pursuant to
§
33.017 shall be considered in accordance with the provisions of subsection (H)
below.
   (B)   Application for variation. An application for a variation shall be
filed with the Administrative Official in the manner prescribed in §
153.247 of this chapter.
   (C)   Hearing, notice and decision. The Board or, as applicable, the Plan
Commission, shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing of an
application for a variation, give public notice thereof as well as due notice
to parties in interest, and decide the application within a reasonable time.
Any party may appear at the hearing in person or by agent or attorney. The
concurring vote of four members of the Board or, as applicable, the Plan
Commission, shall be necessary to grant or, in the case of the Plan Commission,
recommend approval of, a variation. No order or ordinance granting a variation
shall be effective for a period longer than six months unless a building permit
is obtained and the construction, alteration or moving of the building covered
by the order or ordinance is started within that period.
   (D)   Authorized variations. Variations from the terms of this chapter may
be granted only in the following instances and in no other:
      (1)   To vary any of the requirements of this chapter with respect to
minimum sizes of lots, maximum height of buildings and other structures,
maximum and minimum size of buildings, maximum lot coverage by structures and
other impervious surfaces, and minimum depth and width of yards;
      (2)   To vary any of the regulations contained in §§
153.075 through
153.086;
      (3)   To vary any of the regulations contained in §§
153.185 through
153.192;
      (4)   To vary the following requirements of §§
153.045 through
153.060, with respect to signs otherwise authorized in that part:
         (a)   Sign size;
         (b)   Sign height;
         (c)   Combined sign area for on-premises commercial message signs;
         (d)   Logo size; and
         (e)   Location, placement or illumination of signs on a building, or
structure, or on the ground.
   (E)   Standards for variations.
      (1)   The Board shall not grant, and the Plan Commission, as applicable,
shall not recommend approval of, a variance from any of the regulations of this
chapter, as authorized by subsection (D) above, unless it shall make a finding
of fact, based upon the evidence presented to it in a particular case, that:
         (a)   In the case of property the principal use of which is for
business purposes, the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
applicable to the district in which it is located;
         (b)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
         (c)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      (2)   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Board or,
as applicable, the Plan Commission, in making its determination whether the
plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and whether the variation,
if granted, may alter the essential character of the locality, shall take into
consideration the following factors to the extent they are established by the
evidence and deemed relevant by the Board or, as applicable, the Plan
Commission:
         (a)   The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
condition of the property in question would result in a practical difficulty or
particular hardship upon the applicant for the variation, as distinguished from
a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulation were enforced;
         (b)   The conditions upon which the application for variation is based
would not be applicable generally to other property in the same district;
         (c)   The request for the variation is not based exclusively upon the
desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property; and
         (e)   The variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent properties or substantially increase the run-off of stormwater
onto adjacent properties or public streets, or substantially increase
congestion in the public streets or increase the danger of fire or otherwise
endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values
within the neighborhood.
      (3)   For the purpose of further supplementing the above standards and
factors in connection with requests for variations from the requirements of §
153.068, the Board, in making its determination, may also take into
consideration the following factors, among other factors deemed relevant by the
Board, to the extent they are established by the evidence and deemed relevant
by the Board:
         (a)   The effects of the proposed construction on the overall
appearance of the size and bulk of the existing structures on the property when
viewed from streets abutting the property and from adjacent properties;
         (b)   The proximity of the proposed construction to streets abutting
the property and to adjacent properties;
         (c)   The relative proximity of the proposed construction to streets
abutting the property and to adjacent properties in comparison with the
relative proximity of existing structures on other properties in the same
vicinity;
         (d)   The magnitude of the variation requested in absolute terms and
in proportion to the floor area and/or impervious surfaces allowed if the
strict letter of the regulation were enforced;
         (e)   The need for other variations in connection with the proposed
construction and the nature and extent of those other variations;
         (f)   The need for the variation to allow the owner or occupant of the
property to make reasonable use of a structure, the design of which otherwise
fails to conform to generally accepted or prevailing standards of the village
for the use and enjoyment of a structure as a residence for a family;
         (g)   The efficient and advantageous use of existing structures and
the degree to which the proposed construction makes efficient, economical and
advantageous use of existing and proposed floor area and impervious surfaces;
and
         (h)   The reasonableness of the variation requested in light of the
purposes served by the proposed construction and the design problems of the
existing structure intended to be alleviated by the proposed construction.
      (4)   For purposes of supplementing the above standards and factors in
connection with requests for variations from the requirements of §
153.067, the Board, in making its determination, may also take into
consideration the following factors, among other factors deemed relevant by the
Board, to the extent they are established by the evidence and deemed relevant
by the Board:
         (a)   The height and location of existing and proposed structures on
the property and adjacent properties;
         (b)   The need to maintain the height of the proposed structure in
relation to the height of an existing structure in order to enable the existing
and proposed structures to present a pleasing appearance reflecting
architectural integrity and harmony among separate structural elements; and
         (c)   The need to maintain a particular height of a proposed addition
to a structure in order to observe sound structural design and accommodate good
building practices in the construction of the proposed addition.
      (5)   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards with regard to
variations for signs, the Board or, as applicable, the Plan Commission, in
making its determination or recommendationshall take into consideration the
following factors to the extent they are established by the evidence and deemed
relevant by the Board or, as applicable, the Plan Commission:
         (a)   In the case of a commercial message sign, strict application of
the Kenilworth Sign Code would render the applicant unable to yield a
reasonable return from its property.
         (b)   The variation will not endanger the public safety or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
         (c)   The variation would not result in a sign or master sign plan as
required by the Kenilworth Sign Code that:
            1.   Would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes
for which the Kenilworth Sign Code and the provisions from which a variation is
sought were enacted;
            2.   Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or value of adjacent
property or improvements;
            3.   Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets
due to parking or traffic;
            4.   Would create an unnecessary distraction to vehicle and
pedestrian traffic; and
            5.   Would result in a sign that is not aesthetically consistent
with the environment, or not proportional or architecturally compatible with
existing land uses and buildings and with any adjacent residential
neighborhood.
   (F)   Conditions. The Board may impose and, as applicable, the Plan
Commission may recommend imposing, conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefitted by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set out in subsection (E) above to reduce the injurious effect of the
variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the
general intent of this chapter.
   (G)   Prohibited variations.
      (1)   No variation as to use. Under no circumstances shall the Board
grant or, as applicable, the Plan Commission recommend approval of, a variance
under this section to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this
chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited in the district by this chapter.
      (2)   No variation as to prohibited sign.  Under no circumstances shall
the Board or, as applicable, the Plan Commission recommend approval of, a
variation under this section to allow a sign prohibited under §
153.050.
   (H)   Certain variations in the B Business Zoning District.
      (1)   A variation application that is eligible for review pursuant to §
33.017 shall be heard by the Plan Commission in accordance with subsection (C)
above.
      (2)   The Plan Commission shall recommend approval of variances from the
regulations of this chapter in harmony with their general purpose and intent,
only in the specific instances set forth in this section, where the Plan
Commission makes a finding of fact based upon the standards set forth in this
section, that there are practical difficulties or particular hardships in the
way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations.
      (3)   Within 30 days following the date of completion of the public
hearing, the Plan Commission shall forward a coy of its written recommendation
to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees, upon receipt of the Plan
Commission’s recommendations and without further public hearing, by ordinance
may grant the application for the variation with conditions and restrictions,
as may be deemed necessary the Board of Trustees, or deny the application, or
refer it back to the Plan Commission for further consideration.

§ 153.245 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Classes. The following types of uses which, because of their unique
character, can only be properly authorized in any particular district or
districts upon consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon
neighboring property and of the public need for the particular use at the
particular location, are declared to be special uses unless specifically
permitted under this chapter in the district in which proposed to be located:
      (1)   Places of religious worship;
      (2)   Schools including pre-schools and day care centers (except where
conducted as a home occupation);
      (3)   Libraries (where established as the principal use);
      (4)   Other uses private in character but operated not for profit and of
a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to
their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities;
      (5)   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-regulated utility, or
uses traditionally affected with a public interest;
      (6)   Uses identified in §
153.095 as special uses in the B Business District;
      (7)   Single-family attached dwellings where:
         (a)   The lot is located on Ridge Road between Greenwood Avenue and
Park Drive in the R-4 District;
         (b)   The single-family attached dwellings are located in a pre-
existing, multi-family building; and
         (c)   Through substantial alteration of the pre-existing building, the
number of dwelling units previously existing will be reduced by 50% or more;
and
      (8)   Building-mounted wind energy systems (BWES) and small wind energy
systems (SWES) as accessory uses in all districts.
   (B)   Changes in uses. If a use permitted in any district shall become a
special use by reason of the amendment of this section, all uses in existence
on October 13, 1998 shall remain permitted uses and be deemed authorized
special uses on the lots or parts of the lots on which the uses then exist. Any
changes in the use of a structure from a permitted use to a special use or any
accessory use (as defined in §
153.003) that is accessory to a special use shall require authorization as a
special use under this section.
   (C)   Buildings. Except as may be specifically authorized by action of the
Board of Trustees pursuant to subsection (J) below, the construction of a
building or the addition or alteration to the exterior of any building (other
than routine repairs and maintenance) used for or associated with a special use
or any accessory uses that are accessory uses to any special use shall be
deemed a special use requiring further authorization as a special use under
this section, whether the authorized special use or accessory use is authorized
by reason of having been a permitted use prior to the amendment of this section
or is authorized by action of the Board of Trustees pursuant to subsection (J)
below.
   (D)   Impervious surfaces. Except as may be specifically authorized pursuant
to this section, the construction or installation of or the addition to or
alteration (other than routine repairs and maintenance and replacements and
relocations) of impervious surfaces (other than buildings) used for or
associated with a special use or any accessory uses that are accessory uses to
a special use shall be deemed a special use requiring further authorization as
a special use under this section, except that an aggregate of impervious
surfaces (other than buildings) of up to 2% of the lot area may be constructed
or installed on a lot after October 13, 1998 without the prior authorization
otherwise required under this section if the aggregate of all impervious
surfaces (other than buildings) does not and will not exceed 18% of the lot
area, and if all other applicable provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable ordinances are complied with.
   (E)   Playground equipment. Except as may be specifically authorized
pursuant to this section, the construction or installation of or the addition
to or alteration (other than routine repairs and maintenance and replacements)
of playground equipment used for or associated with a special use or any
accessory uses that are accessory uses to a special use shall be deemed a
special use requiring further authorization as a special use under this
section, except that:
      (1)   Playground equipment in existence on October 13, 1998 shall remain
a permitted use on the lots or parts of lots on which the playground equipment
exists on October 13, 1998. Playground equipment for which a building permit or
other request for approval was on file with the village on or before October
13, 1998 shall be considered a permitted use on the lots or parts of lots on
which the playground equipment is proposed to be situated, but only to the
extent a permit therefor or other approval would have been issued (or was not
required) under ordinances in effect prior to October 13, 1998. A building
permit shall be obtained for any alteration (other than routine repairs and
maintenance), relocation, replacement (other than replacement with items
substantially equivalent in size and function) or expansion of the playground
equipment. No building permit shall be issued for any alteration, relocation,
replacement or expansion without authorization as a special use under this
section if the Administrative Official shall determine that the alteration,
relocation, replacement or expansion will or may materially and adversely
affect the public health, safety and welfare, injure the value of other
property in the neighborhood, or interfere with the use and enjoyment of
neighboring properties, compared with the effects of the playground equipment
on the factors before the proposed alteration, relocation, replacement or
expansion;
      (2)   Playground equipment authorized by action of the Board of Trustees
as a special use under this section may be altered, relocated, replaced or
expanded within any applicable limits of the approval. A building permit shall
be obtained for any alteration (other than routine repairs and maintenance),
relocation, replacement (other than replacement with items substantially
equivalent in size and function) or expansion of the playground equipment. No
building permit shall be issued for any alteration, relocation, replacement or
expansion without further authorization under this section if the
Administrative Official shall determine that the alteration, relocation,
replacement, or expansion will or may result in a material departure from the
site plan previously approved by the Board of Trustees or will or may
materially and adversely affect the considerations under which the playground
equipment was previously approved as a special use; and
      (3)   Playground equipment (whether fixed or movable) that, when put to
its intended use does not have or is not intended to have a fixed or single
location on the land, shall not require authorization as a special use or
accessory use that is accessory to a special use.
   (F)   Application. An application for special use shall be filed and
processed in the manner prescribed in §
153.247.
   (G)   Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the Board of Appeals
or the Plan Commission, as the case may be, or authorized by the Board of
Trustees unless the Board of Appeals or the Plan Commission, as the case may
be, and the Board of Trustees shall have taken into consideration the following
factors to the extent deemed relevant to the proposed special use and the
principal structure and each accessory structure used for or associated with
the proposed special use:
      (1)   The necessity for the public convenience at the particular proposed
location;
      (2)   The effects of the proposed design, location and operation on the
public health, safety and welfare;
      (3)   Injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which
it is proposed to be located;
      (4)   Interference with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties;
      (5)   Compatibility with permitted uses in the district in which it is
proposed to be located;
      (6)   Increased traffic congestion on public ways or increased parking
required on public ways;
      (7)   Damage to or destruction of natural scenic or historic features of
significance to the village or the immediate neighborhood; and
      (8)   In the case of playground equipment, in addition to the foregoing
applicable factors, its proximity to and effect on neighboring properties, its
expected intensity of use, and the consistency of the equipment and its
expected use with play equipment customarily associated with a residential use.
   (H)   Authorization; procedures.  
      (1)   Board of Appeals; Plan Commission. Special uses may be recommended
by the Board of Appeals or the Plan Commission, as the case may be, after a
public hearing called and held in the manner prescribed in this chapter and
required by law.
      (2)   Architectural Review Commission. Where the application for special
use also requires a certificate of appropriateness, the Architectural Review
Commission shall review and provide consulting recommendations on the
application for special use at a public meeting. In such instances, the
Architectural Review Commission shall provide comment and recommendations to
the Board of Trustees as to whether the building design and materials,
landscape plan and other proposed exterior aspects of the special use are in
conformity with, in any non-residential district and for any special use in any
residential district, the appearance plan, and, in the Business District, the
Kenilworth Design Guidelines—Business District. Within 30 days following the
date of the completion of the Architectural Review Commission meeting on the
application for special use, the Architectural Review Commission shall forward
a written copy of its recommendations to the Plan Commission or Board of
Appeals, as the case may be.
   (I)   Conditions. The Board of Appeals or the Plan Commission, as the case
may be, may recommend and the Board of Trustees may provide conditions and
restrictions upon the location and operation of a special use and associated
structures, including, but not limited to, provisions for off-street parking
and loading, as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objectives of
this chapter.
   (J)   Action by the Board of Trustees. The findings of the Board of Appeals
or the Plan Commission, as the case may be, on an application for a special
use, arrived at after public hearing, shall be submitted to the Board of
Trustees with a report and recommendations within a reasonable time. Where the
special use also requires a certificate of appropriateness, a written copy of
the Architectural Review Commission’s recommendations on the factors in
paragraph (H)(2) above shall accompany the finding, report and recommendations
of the Board of Appeals or Plan Commission. The Board of Trustees, upon receipt
of the report and recommendations and without further public hearing, by
ordinance may grant the application for the special use with conditions and
restrictions as may be deemed necessary by the Board of Trustees, or deny the
application, or refer it back to the Board of Appeals or the Plan Commission,
as the case may be, for further consideration.

§ 153.246 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Authority. The Board of Trustees may, in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in this section, and by ordinance duly
adopted, grant special uses authorizing the development of planned unit
developments pursuant to the provisions of this section for the development or
redevelopment of any parcel of land, or group of contiguous parcels of land
that are located in the B Business District.
   (B)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to make available a special
use procedure that departs from the strict application of the specific zoning
requirements of the B Business District in an effort to promote excellence in
project design on the part of owners, builders, architects and applicants and
to produce developments which are in keeping with the overall land use, open
space and other objectives of the village comprehensive plan. This special
regulatory technique is included in the village code in recognition that
traditional bulk, use, yard and other regulations may impose less appropriate
regulations upon the development of lots or areas that lend themselves to an
individual, planned approach.
      (2)   Intent. This section is intended to assure that the following land
use and development objectives are accomplished, in addition to the general
land use and development objectives set forth in §§
153.240 through
153.249:
         (a)   To facilitate a development pattern that is consistent with the
objectives of the village comprehensive plan and with the purpose as defined in
this subchapter, which promotes compatible land uses with surrounding
neighborhood;
         (b)   To permit a creative approach to the development and
redevelopment of land in the B Business District;
         (c)   To achieve a more desirable physical environment by allowing
greater flexibility in building design, and site plan layout, and use than
would be possible through the strict application of the generally applicable
zoning and subdivision regulations;
         (d)   To allow more efficient use of the land resulting in more
economic networks of utilities, streets and other facilities;
         (e)   To encourage land uses that promote public health, safety and
welfare; and
         (f)   To allow the relaxation of certain otherwise applicable
substantive requirements based upon procedural protections that provide for the
detailed review of individual proposals for more significant developments in
the B Business District.
   (C)   Requirements and standards. All planned unit developments shall be
subject to the requirements and standards of this section. Subject to the
applicant complying with the provisions of this section, a planned unit
development may deviate from strict conformance with the required density,
dimension, area, bulk, use, and other regulations applicable to the property
upon which the planned unit development is located, but only to the extent
specified in the ordinance approving the final planned unit development, and
excluding the regulations found in §§
153.205 through
153.335.
      (1)   Special use standards. No special use for a planned development
shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant
shall establish that, in addition to the standards set forth in this section
153.246(C), the proposed development will meet each of the standards made
applicable to special uses pursuant to §
153.245(G).
      (2)   Minimum area of development. The applicant shall have the burden of
establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and shape to be
planned and developed as a unified whole capable of meeting the objectives of
planned unit developments pursuant to this section.
      (3)   Unified ownership required. The entire property proposed for
planned development treatment shall be in single ownership or under unified
control as to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a unified
whole. All the owners of the property shall be included as joint applicants on
all applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any
owner as to any tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owner and all
tracts.
      (4)   Compliance with village code required. Construction and
improvements with any planned unit development shall comply with all applicable
village ordinances. Any proposed deviation from village standards or
requirements must be clearly listed on the preliminary plan application and
fully justified as being both necessary to the proper development of the
property and consistent with the objectives set forth in the applicable section
of the village code.
      (5)   Design requirements. The planned unit development as a whole, as
well as the individual buildings and site improvements constructed as part of
the planned unit development, shall be in general conformity with the
Kenilworth Design Guidelines—Business District.
      (6)   Compatibility of uses and design. The uses permitted in the planned
unit development shall be compatible with each other and with existing land
uses in the surrounding area. Uses shall be deemed compatible if all of the
following criteria are met.
         (a)   The individual uses in the planned unit development must be
permitted uses or permitted special uses in the B Business District, unless a
use deviation is approved by the Board of Trustees. Any individual use that is
allowed only as a special use in the B Business District must individually meet
the standards for the granting of special use permits, as established in §
153.245.
         (b)   The uses must be designed and located in conformity with the
surrounding development and adjacent properties.
      (7)   Covenants and restrictions to be enforceable by village. All
covenants, deed restrictions, easements and similar restrictions to be recorded
in connection with the planned unit development shall provide that they may not
be modified, removed or released without the express consent of the Board of
Trustees and that they may be enforced by the village as well as by future
landowners within the proposed development.
      (8)   Public open space and contributions. Whenever the village
comprehensive plan or official map indicates that development of a planned unit
development will create a need for land for public purposes of the village
within the proposed planned unit development, the Board of Trustees may require
that the area be designated and to the extent the need is specifically and
uniquely attributable to the proposed development, dedicated to the village for
the use. In addition, the Board of Trustees may require evidence that all
requirements of village ordinances pertaining to the dedication of land or the
contribution of cash in connection with subdivisions or developments of land
have been met as respects the proposed planned unit development.
      (9)   Common open space.
         (a)   Amount, location and use. When common open space is provided in
a planned unit development, the amount and location of the open space shall be
consistent with its intended function as set forth in the application and
planned unit development plans. No open space shall be used for the
construction of any structure or improvement except the structures and
improvements as may be approved in the final plan as appropriate to the
intended leisure and recreational uses for which the open space is intended.
         (b)   Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants
or dedication of development rights, shall be provided to prevent the
subsequent use of common open space for any use, structure, improvement or
development other than that shown on the approved final plan. The restrictions
must be permanent and not for a given period of years and must run with the
land.
         (c)   Ownership and maintenance. The final plan shall include
provisions for the ownership and maintenance of the open space and improvements
as are reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care, conservation,
maintenance and operation in accordance with predetermined standards and to
ensure that remedial measures will be available to the village if the open
space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or are not maintained in a
condition consistent with the best interests of the planned unit development or
the village.
      (10)   Property owners’ association. When the requirements of paragraph

DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL, AND OF BOARD OF APPEALS AND BOARD OF
TRUSTEES ON MATTERS OF APPEAL
§ 153.275 PROCEDURES AS TO QUESTIONS OF INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Authority. The Administrative Official, subject to the procedures,
standards and limitations of this section, may render interpretations,
including use interpretations, of the provisions of this chapter and of any
rule or regulation issued pursuant to it.
   (B)   Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this section is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this chapter, though detailed and
lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may
have to be applied. Many situations, however, can be readily addressed by an
interpretation of the specific provisions of this chapter in light of the
general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority herein established is an administrative
rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the
essential content of this chapter but rather is intended only to allow
authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
   (C)   Parties entitled to seek interpretations. Applications for
interpretations may be filed by any person having an interest in the
circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation; provided, however,
that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on
hypothetical facts or where the interpretation would have no effect other than
as an advisory opinion.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   Application. Applications for interpretations of this chapter shall
be filed in accordance with the requirements of §
153.247.
      (2)   Action on application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a
properly completed application for interpretation, the Administrative Official
shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the
specific precedent, reasons and analysis upon which the determination is based.
The failure of the Administrative Official to act within 30 days, or a further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a contrary
interpretation rendered on the day following the 30-day period thereby allowing
the applicant to pursue an appeal pursuant to §
153.243.
      (3)   Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Administrative
Official may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in §
153.243.
   (E)   Standards for use interpretations. The following standards shall
govern the Administrative Official and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals
from the Administrative Official, in issuing use interpretations.
      (1)   Any use defined in §
153.003 shall be interpreted as therein defined.
      (2)   No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use
or a special use in a district to be established in any district in which the
use is not so listed.
      (3)   No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with each use
limitation established for that particular district.
      (4)   No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district
unless the use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in the district
and is more similar to other uses than to uses permitted or specially permitted
in a less restrictive district.
      (5)   If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a
special use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use
interpretation permitting the use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a
special use permit for the use pursuant to §
153.245.
   (F)   Effect of favorable use interpretation. No use interpretation finding
a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular
district shall authorize the establishment of the use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of
applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the village including, but not limited to, a special use
permit, a certificate of zoning compliance, a temporary use permit, a building
permit, a certificate of occupancy and subdivision approval.
   (G)   Limitations on favorable use interpretations. Subject to an extension
of time granted by the Administrative Official, no use interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district
shall be valid for a period longer than six months from the date of issue
unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a
certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period.
A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially
permitted in a particular district shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and the permit shall not be deemed to
authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation has
not been issued. The permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any
force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.

   (B)   Payment; liens. The owner of the property which is the subject of the
application and, if different, the applicant, shall be jointly and severally
liable for the payment of the fees required by this subchapter. By signing the
application, the owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay the fee and to
consent to the filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to
ensure collection of any fee, plus the cost of collection, which has not been
paid within 30 days following the mailing of a written demand for payment to
the owner at the address shown on the application. Any lien filed pursuant to
this section may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages
or mechanics liens.

chapter shall be accompanied by the required fee plus, where required, an
additional amount for recoverable costs as provided in §
153.291, as fixed from time to time by the Administrative Official, to be
deposited in an application fee escrow. No interest shall be payable on any
escrow.
   (B)   Charges against escrow. From the date of filing of any application for
which the recovery of actual costs is required pursuant to this chapter, the
village shall maintain an accurate record of the actual costs, as defined in

shall, from time to time, draw funds from the escrow account established for
the application to pay the costs and shall transfer the funds to the
appropriate village accounts. The Administrative Official shall maintain an
accurate record of all drawings.
   (C)   Additional escrow deposits. Should the Administrative Official at any
time determine that the escrow account established in connection with any
application for which the recovery of actual costs is required is, or is likely
to become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of processing the application,
the Administrative Official shall inform the applicant of that fact and demand
an additional deposit in an amount deemed by him or her to be sufficient to
cover foreseeable additional costs. Unless and until the additional amount is
deposited by the applicant, the Administrative Official may direct that
processing of the application shall be suspended or terminated.
   (D)   Final settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application for which the recovery of actual costs is required,

escrow deposits made in connection with the application and the actual cost of
processing the application and shall make a final charge of the costs against
the escrow deposits. A copy of the accounting shall be provided to the owner
and the applicant. If the amount in the escrow account is insufficient to pay
the total actual costs, a written demand for payment of the balance due shall
be mailed to the owner and the applicant. If unused balance remains in the
escrow account after paying the total actual costs, it shall be returned to the
applicant.

§ 153.293 CONDITION OF ALL APPLICATIONS, APPROVALS AND PERMITS; TIME PERIODS.
   No application filed pursuant to this chapter shall be considered complete
unless and until all fees and deposits due pursuant to this subchapter have

or action shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval, time
periods shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment, but shall otherwise
continue to run. The failure to fully pay any fee or deposit, when due, shall
be grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or revoking
any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development
to which the unpaid fee or deposit relates.

APPENDIX A: APPEARANCE PLAN
Section I. CRITERIA FOR APPEARANCE.
   The purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items
which affect the physical aspect of the village environment. Pertinent to
appearance is the design of the site, building and structures, planting, signs
and miscellaneous other objects which are observed by the public.
   These criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation, or
variety, but rather to assist in focusing on design principles which can result
in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within
the village.
   A.   Relationship of buildings to site.
      1.   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with
the streetscape, and to provide
for adequate planting, pedestrian movement and parking areas.
      2.   Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning
restrictions is encouraged to provide an interesting relationship between
buildings.
      3.   Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building
wall extensions, plantings, berms or other innovative means so as to largely
screen parking areas from view from public ways.
      4.   The height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its
site and adjoining buildings.
      5.   Newly installed utility services and service revisions necessitated
by exterior alterations, shall be underground.
      6.   In relating buildings to site, the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in regard to bulk regulations, standards and off-street parking shall
be part of this criteria. This shall also apply to subsection B. which follows.
   B.   Relationship of building and site to adjoining area.
      1.   Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles shall be made
compatible by such means as screens, site breaks and materials.
      2.   Attractive landscape transition to adjoining properties shall be
provided.

avoided.
      4.   Buildings shall have similar scale to those in the surrounding area.
   C.   Building design.
      1.   Architectural style is not restricted -- evaluation of appearance of
a project shall be based on quality of its design and relationship to
surroundings.
      2.   Buildings shall have good scale and be in harmonious conformance
with permanent neighboring development.
      3.   Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be
selected for harmony of the building with adjoining buildings.
   Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of buildings and the
design in which they are used. Buildings shall have the same materials, or
those which are architecturally harmonious, used for all building walls and
other exterior building components wholly or partly visible from public ways.
   Inappropriate materials and methods, and those which will produce
inconsistency with the structure of the building, shall be avoided.
   Materials shall be of durable quality.
   In any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view, the
structural materials shall meet the other criteria for materials.
   4.   Building components – such as windows, doors, eaves and parapets –
shall have good proportions and relationship to one another.
   5.   Colors shall be harmonious, with bright or brilliant colors used only
for accent.
   6.   Mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on roof, ground or
buildings shall be screened from public view with materials harmonious with the

ways.
   7.   Exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural concept. Fixtures,
standards and all exposed accessories shall be harmonious with building design.
   8.   Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards and
exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public ways, using
materials as stated in criteria for equipment screening.
   9.   Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be
avoided. Variation of detail, form and siting shall be used to provide visual
interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or individual
buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance.
   10.   Inappropriate, incompatible, bizarre and exotic designs shall be
avoided.
   11.   The provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in regard to bulk regulations
and standards, and those portions of the Kenilworth Building Code which
directly affect appearance, shall be part of the criteria of this subsection.
   D.   Signs.
      1.   Wall signs shall be part of the architectural concept. Size, color,
lettering, location and arrangement shall be harmonious with the building
design, and shall be compatible with signs on adjoining buildings. Signs shall
have good proportions.
      2.   Ground signs shall be designed to be compatible with the
architecture of the building. The same criteria applicable to wall signs shall
apply to ground signs.
      3.   Identification signs of a prototype design shall conform to the
criteria for building and ground signs.

shall be part of the criteria of this subsection.
   E.   Maintenance – planning and design factors.
      1.   Continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of
maintenance. The choice of materials and their use, together with the types of
finishes and other protective measures, must be conducive to easy maintenance
and upkeep.
      2.   Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and
wear as well as for their beauty. Proper measures and devices shall be
incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect, damage and abuse.
      3.   Provision for washing and cleaning of buildings and structures, and
control of dirt and refuse, shall be included in the design. Such
configurations that tend to catch and ac-cumulate debris, leaves, trash, dirt
and rubbish shall be avoided.
   F.   Factors for evaluation.
   The following factors and characteristics relating to a development, and
which affect appearance, will govern the Architectural Review Commission’s
evaluation of a design submissions
      Conformance to ordinances and the village plan

§ 154.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The topography of the Village of Kenilworth includes bluffs and other
steep slope areas. These are valuable land resources that should be protected.
Bluffs and other steep slope areas play a central role in the management of
storm water throughout the village; they are also ecologically fragile and
inherently unstable. Their proper care and maintenance are important to avoid
degradation that could adversely affect the entire community.
   (B)   Steep slope areas may contain sediment, rock, and soils (i) that are
natural features subject to erosion, surface and subsurface movement of water,
and other destabilizing forces, and (ii) whose stability is affected by the
quality and root structure of natural ground cover. Regulating proposed
development according to the natural characteristics of steep slope terrain,
such as degree of sloping, significant vegetation, soil stability, and existing
drainage patterns will allow for development on top of steep slope areas,
including bluffs, while minimizing the physical impact of such development. The
public interest will be served by protecting people and property from the
potentially hazardous geological and hydrological conditions characteristic of
ravine and other steep slope areas.
(Ord. 1163, passed 12-14-2015)
§ 154.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate development along or
near steep slope areas to protect slope stability and overall drainage and
water management in the village. The purpose of this chapter is not to regulate
for aesthetic or habitat preservation purposes; rather, the purpose is to
prevent erosion of ravines and bluffs by regulating and managing steep slopes
for purposes of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. This chapter
protects people and property from the potentially hazardous geological and
hydrological conditions characteristic of ravine and bluff areas and further
recognizes that maintenance of stable ecological relationships minimizes
environmental degradation of the land and Lake Michigan. Due to improper and
unnecessary development within these sensitive areas, conditions are created
that jeopardize life, property, and the natural ecosystem. It is the intent of
this chapter to establish appropriate controls. All land use and development
on, within, and adjacent to the steep slope is controlled by this chapter.
      (2)   While this chapter provides for the reasonable use of steep slope
zones and related lands, it does so while protecting the public health, safety,
and welfare by:
         (a)   Discouraging development that threatens the stability of steeply
sloped terrain;
         (b)   Encouraging appropriate engineering technology to result in
stable slopes during and subsequent to development;
         (c)   Encouraging building techniques that increase slope stability;
         (d)   Reducing uncontrolled storm water runoff, soil erosion, and mud
slides by minimizing grading, encouraging the preservation of trees and other
vegetation, and, where necessary, requiring revegetation;
         (e)   Permitting development that is compatible with the natural
characteristics of steep slope terrain, such as degree of sloping, soil
suitability, and existing natural and man-made drainage patterns;
         (f)   Preserving the ravine and bluff environment through the
retention of dominant steep slopes and ridges in their natural state; and
         (g)   Reducing the physical impact on steep slopes and related areas
by encouraging innovative site and architectural design, minimizing grading,
and requiring restoration of graded areas.
   (B)   Applicability. This chapter only applies to properties that include or
are adjacent to a bluff along Lake Michigan or that portion of the Skokie Ditch
located east of Sheridan Road and north of Kenilworth Avenue.
(Ord. 1163, passed 12-15-2015)
§ 154.03 DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
herein ascribed to them, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. In the
case of any difference of meaning between the text of this chapter and any
caption or illustration, the text shall control.
   ACCESSORY BUILDING. A detached, one-story, covered structure designed to
provide enclosed storage or a screened or unscreened sitting area in the Steep
Slope Zone.
   BLUFF. An elevated segment of the Lake Michigan shoreline above the beach
which normally has a precipitous front inclining steeply on the lakeward side.
   CANTILEVER. Any portion of a principal structure that extends laterally
beyond the foundation that supports it.
   CODE OFFICIAL. The code official shall be the Building Commissioner.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change (other than minor common maintenance of

utilities; dredging, filling, drilling, mining, grading, paving, or excavation
operations; and open storage of equipment or materials.
   RAVINE. A deep gully or gorge worn by the flow of water to Lake Michigan. In
this chapter, all references to ravine shall refer that portion of the Skokie
Ditch located east of Sheridan Road and north of Kenilworth Avenue.
   STEEP SLOPE. Land comprising or adjacent to a lake bluff or ravine where the
slope in ascent or descent exceeds 10% from the horizontal.
   STEEP SLOPE LINE. A line representing the intersection of the tableland and
the steep slope. This line is commonly indicated on plats of survey or other
documents as the TOP OF BLUFF.
   STEEP SLOPE ZONE.
      (1)   In the case of a ravine, that portion of a lot that includes the
steep slope of the ravine and lies between the bottom of the ravine and a line
drawn ten feet behind the steep slope line at the top edge of the ravine and
away from the bottom of the ravine. For the purposes of this chapter, the
RAVINE means the Skokie Ditch east of Sheridan Road. The STEEP SLOPE ZONE shall
include all retaining walls located between the bottom of the ravine and the
steep slope line.
      (2)   In the case of a bluff, that portion of a lot that includes the
steep slope and lies between the water’s edge of Lake Michigan and a line drawn
35 feet behind the steep slope line at the top edge of the bluff and away from
the bottom of the bluff. The STEEP SLOPE ZONE shall include all retaining walls
located between Lake Michigan and the steep slope line.

(Ord. 1163, passed 12-14-2015)
§ 154.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Review of application. Any application for development in the Steep
Slope Zone shall be reviewed by the code official, who will consider such
application in light of the standards of this section relating to landscape
planning, soil mechanics engineering, hydrology, geology, environmental design,
and architecture. It is recognized, however, that each Steep Slope Zone has
unique characteristics and encounters different dynamics affecting its
stability and preservation. As a result, the code official may determine for
any application that certain of the following standards may not apply in whole
or in part to such application so long as the code official determines that the
application for development in its totality satisfies the purposes of this
chapter.
   (B)   Standards. The standards applicable to development in a Steep Slope
Zone are as follows:
      (1)   Filling, grading, and earth moving.
         (a)   Minimum alterations. Filling, grading, and earth moving shall be
limited to the minimum required for removal and replacement of foundations,
driveways, drainage control structures, and immediate yard areas. Substantial
filling, grading, and earth moving shall not be permitted and is prohibited.
         (b)   Erosion control. All filling, grading, and earth moving shall be
accomplished in a manner that will create the lowest possible potential for
airborne or waterborne transportation of soil. Temporary erosion control
matting shall be properly staked and trenched nightly where large areas of soil
are exposed.
         (c)   Soil fill in Steep Slope Zone. All fill in the Steep Slope Zone
is prohibited, other than back-fill which is determined by the code official to
be necessary for slope stabilization.
         (d)   Soil fill on table land. In conformance with generally accepted
engineering standards, all fill on table land shall be stabilized to at least
90% of maximum dry density as determined in ASTM procedure D-1557 or
equivalent.
         (e)   Prompt completion. Any earth moving shall be accomplished in the
shortest practical period of time, the schedule of which shall be approved by
the code official. All excavated material shall be removed from the Steep Slope
Zone and no temporary or permanent material storage shall be permitted within
the Steep Slope Zone. No existing natural vegetation shall be destroyed,
removed or disturbed prior to the initiation of development activities.
      (2)   Safety control of steep slopes.
         (a)   The development will not jeopardize slope stability on the
subject site or neighboring properties.
         (b)   Except as can be shown to be essential or beneficial for an
approved development, no filling, grading, and earth moving shall occur in a
Steep Slope Zone.
         (c)   Whenever there is construction upon any property that includes
or is adjacent to a Steep Slope Zone, a fence will be erected temporarily along
the top edge of the Steep Slope Zone, during any construction and/or demolition
activity upon such property.
      (3)   Construction techniques. All proposed structures shall have
foundations designed in a manner consistent with sound engineering and
geological principles. In addition, the following techniques shall be employed
to enhance stabilization of the ravine or bluff:
         (a)   Planning the development to recognize and fit the natural
topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and other existing conditions on the
proposed sites;
         (b)   Orienting development so that filling, grading, and earth
moving, landscaping and other site preparation is kept to an absolute minimum;
         (c)   Preserving the landscape through minimized disruption of natural
terrain and existing vegetation;
         (d)   Minimizing disruption or alteration of natural drainage ways;
         (e)   Minimizing the time during which areas are bare and exposed;
         (f)   Designing and properly locating structures so that structure’s
weight does not negatively impact slope stability; and
         (g)   Considering the effect of undercutting at the base of a Steep
Slope Zone caused by wave action, storm water flow, erosion, and/or channel
changes.
         (h)   Providing for management of silt runoff during the construction
period.
      (4)   Vegetation and revegetation.
         (a)   Natural vegetation. Unless being revegetated as part of the
development, every effort shall be made to maintain natural vegetation in the
Steep Slope Zone.
         (b)   Smallest area. At all times, the smallest practical area of raw
soil shall be exposed for as short a duration of time as practical. When
required by the code official pursuant to sound professional engineering
principles, temporary vegetation or other acceptable cover shall be used to
protect areas of raw soil exposed during development and to prevent airborne or
waterborne transportation of soil.
         (c)   Revegetation. A mixed planting of perennial and woody species is
recommended for use in the Steep Slope Zone disturbed by development.
         (d)   Erosion control mat. Temporary erosion control matting properly
staked and trenched shall be provided over raw soil areas until new vegetation
is established.
      (5)   Hydrological controls.
         (a)   Natural channels. Natural drainage ways shall be preserved to
the maximum extent possible.
         (b)   Controlled runoff. Concentrated runoff from impervious surfaces
shall be collected and transported in a pipe or other approved manner to a
municipal storm sewer system, if available. In no instance shall runoff be
transported to, directed toward, or be allowed to collect in any pipe or
conveyance that is part of the combined storm/sanitary sewer system of the
village.
         (c)   Water discharge into steep slope. Whenever stormwater is
transported across a property for discharge into a Sleep Slope Zone, the
conveyance pipes shall be of non-segmented (continuous sections of minimum 100
feet) pipe material, which shall be installed below ground by directional
boring where possible.
         (d)   Trenching. No pipe shall be installed within a Steep Slope Zone
by excavating a trench unless such trench is approved by the code official.
         (e)   Pipe materials. Flexible corrugated pipes shall not be used
within a Steep Slope Zone unless directional boring is found to be infeasible
in the sole determination of the code official.
         (f)   Interceptor ditches. When required by the code official pursuant
to sound professional engineering principles, interceptor ditches shall be
established above steep slopes in order that soil shall not become saturated
and the intercepted water shall be conveyed in a pipe or other approved manner
to a municipal storm sewer system, if available, or to the bottom of ravine or
bluff slopes in a manner designed to prevent erosion. In no instance shall
runoff be transported to, directed toward, or be allowed to collect in any pipe
or conveyance that is part of the combined storm/sanitary sewer system of the
village.
         (g)   Discharge point stabilization. Natural drainage ways shall be
stabilized by landscape integration and rip-rap or other means consistent with
sound professional engineering practice, to a distance below drainage and
culvert discharge points sufficient to convey the discharge without channel
erosion and in such a manner as to dissipate the energy of the discharge as
approved by the code official.
         (h)   Energy dissipater. All outflow from a stormwater conveyance pipe
must discharge into an energy dissipater designed to slow fast moving
stormwater and prevent soil erosion.
         (i)   Early completion. The overall drainage system shall be completed
and made operational at the earliest possible time during construction, the
schedule of which shall be approved by the code official.
         (j)   Impact on adjacent property. The natural or usual flow of
surface or subsurface water shall not be altered or obstructed in any way by
grade changes that may adversely affect the property of another by contributing
either to pooling or collection of waters or to the concentration or
intensification of surface water discharge.

      (7)   Additional submittals; waivers. The code official may require
additional plans as needed for review. The code official may release an
applicant from any element of the aforementioned plan submittals to the extent
that the code official determines that such element(s) will not materially
assist in the evaluation of the proposed action’s impact on slope stability.
   (B)   Permit issuance; terms. Each permit application for development shall
be made in compliance with Chapter 150 of this code and other applicable codes,
ordinances, or regulations, including this chapter. The seal of an Illinois
licensed structural or geotechnical engineer shall appear on all plans and
specifications included as part of a permit application. Upon the code official
determining that an application satisfies the requirements of this chapter, the
code official shall cause a permit to be issued for development within the
Steep Slope Zone. The following provisions are to be imprinted upon each permit
issued for any development activities authorized by the administration of this
chapter and (whether so imprinted or not) shall be incorporated into and made a
part of any such permit:
      (1)   Limited obligation. Compliance with the procedures of this chapter
and the issuance of any related permits shall not be construed to impose any
legal or other obligation upon the village or its elected or appointed
officials, employees, agents, attorneys, or representatives. Any permit issued
pursuant to this chapter is for the benefit of the public and not for the
benefit of any individual.
      (2)   Civil claims. Compliance with the procedures of this chapter and
the issuance of related permits shall not relieve the permittee and the
property owner from civil liability claims.
      (3)   Endorsement. Compliance with the procedures of this chapter and the
issuance of related permits do not imply approval of the need for, or the
benefit or efficacy of, the proposed development; nor does it constitute any
assertion that the proposed development will not result in damage to the
property in question or to adjoining property.
      (4)   Closing report. A licensed professional structural engineer or
geotechnical engineer must inspect all work in the Steep Slope Zone while in
progress and, upon completion of the work, deliver to the code official a
written report bearing the engineer’s license seal, stating that all
development is in accordance with the approved plan and specifications for the
project. Such a report must be delivered prior to the village’s final
inspection, acceptance, and closing of the project.
   (C)   Special terms. In connection with the issuance of a permit pursuant to
this chapter, the code official may impose special conditions as deemed
necessary to ensure the effectiveness of plans for development on a property,
and to protect the long-term stability of a bluff or ravine, or otherwise to
notify future owners of the bluff or ravine conditions of such property.
(Ord. 1163, passed 12-14-2015)
§ 154.07 STABILITY OF THE STEEP SLOPES.

§ 154.09 APPEALS OF CODE OFFICIAL’S DECISIONS.
   (A)   Any determination of the code official under this chapter may be
appealed to the Board of Trustees by filing a request for review in writing
within 35 days after the code official issues his or her determination. The
Board of Trustees may designate a committee of the Board to hear the request
for review and make a written recommendation to the Board of Trustees. The
decision of the Board of Trustees will be final.
   (B)   In reviewing the determination of the code official, the Board of
Trustees will consider only whether the determination of the code official in
applying the regulations of this chapter imposes an unreasonable and undue
economic hardship that materially limits the property owner from making
reasonable use of such owner’s property or otherwise imposes requirements which
are unreasonably burdensome to the property owner given the benefits thereof to
the village. After receiving written submittals from the property owner and the
code official (and after a hearing if the Board of Trustees determines that
such a hearing will be instructive), a decision on such appeal must be issued
in writing no more than 60 days after the delivery of the final submittal by
the owner or code official or after the close of the hearing, whichever is
later.
   (C)   In considering an appeal under this section, the Board of Trustees may
reverse, affirm, or modify the determination of the code official, or remand
the determination back to the code official for further consideration, with or
without instructions.
   (D)   The Board of Trustees may issue further procedural rules governing
appeals under this section.
(Ord. 1163, passed 12-14-2015)
§ 154.10 ZONING VARIATIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the ability of an owner to seek
a variation from the otherwise applicable zoning regulations affecting such
owner’s property. To the extent that the regulations of this chapter materially
restrict the ability of a property to be developed the Zoning Board of Appeals
may determine that the effects of this chapter can, in appropriate
circumstances, constitute a practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship.
(Ord. 1163, passed 12-14-2015)
