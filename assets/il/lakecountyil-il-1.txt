Staff Summary
•   For 70 plus years Lake County has been enacting codes and ordinances. Up to
this point, these codes and ordinances have been maintained by independent
departments and offices. It is common practice for governments to codify their
ordinances in an effort to make them more easily viewable to the public.
•   The purpose of codification is to compile all of the codes into one
document, adopt uniform formatting, provide referencing between complimentary
codes, and to create a digital code book that is accessible from the website
and easier for our customers to use.
•   Lake County issued an RFP and contracted with American Legal Publishing to
review codes, digitize the older paper codes, and develop a draft codified
ordinance. The draft code was then reviewed multiple times by each department,
office or agency and also by the State's Attorney's Office.
•   This action compiles existing codes and does not change the law or legal
content or effect of the existing code. This action accepts and approves the
digital code provided by American Legal, ratifies all code changes passed by
the board from May of 2014 through January of 2015, and requests American Legal
codify those codes and incorporate them into the final code to be published on
the website.
•   Here forward ordinances and amendments to ordinances will be incorporated
into the digital code within days of passage and will be incorporated into the
four printed copies a few times per year.
•   The codified ordinance can be viewed online at: <http_://www.amlegal.com/

ordinances, the repealed portions may be excluded from the code by the omission

unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity or

unconstitutional provision or its application, and to this end the provisions
of this code of ordinances are severable.

shall also include the designee or agent of the officer or office, unless the
law or the context clearly requires otherwise.

   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the

codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall remain in effect and are
saved.

subsequent amendments or revisions to those technical codes shall automatically

DEPARTMENTS
§ 30.55 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   There is need, and it is in the best interests of the County of
Lake, that a Department of Public Works be organized to exercise the powers and
authority prescribed by An Act in Relation to Water Supply, Drainage, Sewage,
Pollution, and Flood Control in Certain Counties (55 ILCS 5/5-15001 et seq.),
and there is hereby created the Lake County Department of Public Works, and
that the Chairman of the Board is authorized to take all necessary action as
provided by law in order to organize the Department.
      (2)   The county is hereby prohibited from levying any tax to pay for the
operation of the Department; all recipients of the services of the Department
of Public Works shall pay for the entire cost of the operation.
      (3)   The county hereby will, in a manner and to an extent consistent
with the county’s interest and responsibility, provide financial support in the
form of loans to projects which, by resolution of the Board, are deemed to be
in the best interest of the growth and development of the county.
      (4)   The Department of Public Works is hereby prohibited from exercising
its powers in any area where similar services are available from another agency
or governmental unit, unless expressly requested by that agency or governmental
unit to provide the services in that area.
      (5)   From and after this date, notice of any proposed revisions,
amendments, or alterations of this section which establishes a Department of
Public Works, shall be sent by registered mail to the presiding officer of each
incorporated municipality within the county and all township supervisors 60
days prior to consideration by the County Board.
      (6)   If and when requests for withdrawals or transfers from the County

members of the County Board shall be notified in writing ten days prior to the

      (7)   Any and all monies advanced or transferred from the County General
Corporate Fund to the Public Works Department as established by this section
shall be repaid to the County General Corporate Fund from revenues derived from
the Department of Public Works facilities, established with financial support
from the county, as the revenues become available.
(1977 Code, § 7:1)
   (B)   Considerations and principles relating to intergovernmental agreements
for sewer and amendments to existing agreements.
      (1)   Premises.
         (a)   The County is a regional government.
         (b)   County decisions often have regional effects that should be
evaluated.
         (c)   In addition, as the primary regional government in Lake County,
the County has a special responsibility to encourage intergovernmental
cooperation.
      (2)   Decision-making process.
         (a)   In order to give appropriate consideration to intergovernmental
impacts of decisions, the external effects of decisions should be thoroughly
evaluated through consultation with affected or potentially affected
governmental units, agencies, and departments.
         (b)   Decisions should be made with due consideration to the
objectives of the County’s Framework Plan.
         (c)   Decisions should also be made giving due consideration to the
direct and indirect effects of such decisions, including the totality of the
benefits and impacts of the decision on affected governmental units, agencies,
and departments.
         (d)   Ultimately, the County as a regional government must exercise
its legislative discretion in determining what it believes is best for the
County and its residents as a whole.
      (3)   Factors to be assessed relating to sewer service decisions.
         (a)   The County is not a public utility, but it provides certain
public services with the goal of enhancing the well being of all Lake County
residents. This goal is ordinarily achieved through the use of regional
publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities.
         (b)   In making decisions related to sewer service, the County should
evaluate both direct and indirect effects from both a policy and practical
perspective. Those effects may include without limitation:
            1.   Consistency with the Framework Plan;
            2.   Impact on other affected public bodies;
            3.   Consistency with relevant municipal plans;
            4.   Fiscal and related benefits;
            5.   Available and committed capacity of system;
            6.   Level of support/opposition to proposal;
            7.   Impact on County roads and other services;
            8.   Specific environmental concerns.
         (c)   Coordination of concerns of affected governments is important to
achieve appropriate planning and wise investment of public resources. This is
increasingly important as development spreads throughout the County and actions
of one community are more likely to affect other communities.
         (d)   To better ensure that decisions are made based on understandable
parameters, sewer service agreements and amendments to such agreements should
ordinarily be based on specific limitations on the County’s obligations to
provide such services. Those limitations should be expressed in terms of
capacity and, when appropriate, the nature of the development to be served. In
addition, amendments to existing sewer service agreements should ordinarily be
considered in the context of specific developments to be served.
         (e)   Although past practices are important, the considerations and
effects of sewer decisions are ever-evolving and cannot be made based on static
models of precedent.
   (C)   Pollution policies. The following are hereby adopted as the present
policy of this Board of Supervisors of Lake County, Illinois.
      (1)   The main purpose in development of the county-wide facilities are
eventually to eliminate intolerable pollution problems, to reduce existing
problems to acceptable levels, and to prevent the formation of new problem
areas in a manner that provides adequately for the growing population.
      (2)   The County Public Works Department shall implement the provisions
of providing the proposed facilities to collect, transport and treat sanitary
wastes in accordance with said master plan and policies.
      (3)   The master plan should be implemented with negotiations with
municipalities and/or sanitary districts for the operation and maintenance of
existing treatment facilities.
      (4)   The Public Works Department will cooperate with all local, state
and federal agencies in the achievement of the goals set forth in this master
plan.
      (5)   The County Public Works Department shall implement the provision of
local sanitary sewer service in unincorporated areas of the county.
      (6)   The location of the interceptor sanitary sewers and sewage
treatment facilities shown on Plate 1 will depend and will be subject to change
based on availability of easement and land, and economic factors which can only
be determined after detailed field survey, but will as near os feasible be the
location shown.
      (7)   The proposed sewage treatment plant shall be designed to meet all
state and federal regulations and will be designed as near as practical in a
manner which will provide for improvement to full water reclamation facilities
by the year 1985. The equipment, installation and operation of the sewage
treatment facilities will be in accordance with the highest water pollution
control standards.
      (8)   The Public Works Department will complete a study on each existing
sewage plant at the proper time to determine the following:
         (a)   Whether or not to vacate or relocate the facilities;
         (b)   Whether or not to expand the present facilities and provide
additional interim capacity;
         (c)   Whether or not to utilize the facility for pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
         (d)   Whether or not to utilize the facility for treatment of storm
water flaws. Generally, the policy shall be to vacate these plants as soon as
possible except where they may be utilized for pretreatment of industrial
wastes and/or treatment of storm water flows.
      (9)   The Public Works Department should pursue all practical methods in
obtaining ways in financing the construction of the necessary facilities. The
financing of the facilities shall be by user fees and/or general taxes that
spread in the area serviced.
      (10)   Any new sewage treatment facilities or interim sewage facilities
shall be built only with the approval of the Public Works Department and
ownership will be in the County of Lake.
      (11)   The Public Works Department shall pursue through various local,
state and federal agencies a program to provide water for low flow augmentation
on the Des Planes and Fox Rivers to clean the water of these streams to good
recreational standards for the benefit of the Lake County Forest Preserve, land
owners and public use of these natural water resources.
      (12)   (a)   The priority of construction of these facilities shall be as
follows:
            1.   Priority 1: Northwest Area;
            2.   Priority 2: Southeast Area;
            3.   Priority 3: East Central Area;
            4.   Priority 4: Southwest Area;
            5.   Priority 5: Northeast Area.
         (b)   Land acquisition should be accomplished immediately for all
sewage treatment plant sites. These priorities may vary dependent upon the
financial ability of the various areas to issue revenue bonds. The entire
proposed facilities should be constructed by the year 1974.
      (13)   The Public Works Department will provide a continuing study of the
existing sanitary conditions and facilities needed for water pollution control
and abatement and will submit a written report updating the master plan every
five years to the County Board, or at any time that changes in the county
growth pattern or other planning factors would require a major revision.
      (14)   The said master plan and the policy statements contained herein
should be revised from time to time by passage of an appropriate resolution by
this Board of Supervisors.
   (D)   Master plan update. The Supplement to the 1962 Comprehensive Report
ion the Existing Sanitary Conditions and Proposed Facilities for Water
Pollution Control and Abatement, as amended December 17, 1968, is revised and
amended to show the new master plan as prepared by Consoer, Townsend &
Associates, a copy of which is attached to the resolution codified herein and
made a part hereof, shall be adopted as the Lake County master plan west of the
North Shore Sanitary District boundaries, more particularly, Plate #1 of the
said Supplement to the Comprehensive Report shall be adopted as the County
master plan.

COUNTY PURCHASING SUBCHAPTER
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.001 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
   The policy of the county is to enter into contracts for goods, services,
construction, and professional services at fair and reasonable compensation for
the work performed. The county shall develop procedures to (1) manage the
procurement process in accordance with the law; (2) spend the taxpayers’ money
wisely and fairly; (3) protect against fraud and favoritism; (4) encourage
participation by county businesses and promote equality of opportunity for
minority- and women-owned businesses; and (5) best meet the needs of Lake
County’s various departments through continuous improvement of the county’s
purchasing systems and procedures.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 1-101, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.002 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter applies to contracts to procure goods, services,
construction, and professional services entered into by Lake County and its
applicable agencies. It shall apply to every expenditure of public funds by a
county agency for public purchasing irrespective of the funding source, except
as otherwise provided by state law, state regulation, county ordinance, or
administrative policy.
   This chapter does not apply to purchases by elected officials or county
agencies not statutorily required to purchase in compliance with county
policies or for whom purchases are not made by the county. But, if an elected
official or county agency not otherwise required to comply with this chapter
chooses to make any purchase with the assistance of the Purchasing Division,
this chapter shall apply.
   When the procurement involves spending state or federal money, then any
applicable mandatory state and federal laws shall be followed. Nothing in this
subchapter shall prevent any county agency from complying with the terms and
conditions of any grant, gift, bequest, or cooperative purchasing agreement
that is otherwise consistent with law. This subchapter does not apply to the
procurement of legal services.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 1-102, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.003 PUBLIC ACCESS TO PROCUREMENT INFORMATION.
   Procurement information shall be a public record to the extent provided in
the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, being 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq., and shall
be available to the public as provided by the Freedom of Information Act.
   If a bidder or proposer believes a bid, proposal, offer, specifications or
protest submitted to the county contains either trade secrets or proprietary
information a statement should be included in the submission that describes and
supports their claim. The statement must specifically identify which part of
the submission must be considered confidential and explain why.
   Entire bid submissions or proposals may not be labeled confidential
material. Trade secrets or proprietary information are exempt from inspection
and copying under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, and the Act
ultimately governs what information can be withheld from the public.
   Bidders and proposers assume the risk that an administrative agency or a
court may conclude that the information contained in their bids or proposals is
not exempt from disclosure under the Act. The county can thus not guarantee
that submissions will ultimately be free from disclosure, and the statement a
bidder or proposer submits to the county should clearly articulate why
nondisclosure should apply.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 1-103, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.004 AUTHORIZATION FOR BUDGETED VERSUS NON-BUDGETED ITEMS.
   (A)   Budgeted items, or items that fall within a budget category. For
purchases that are either explicitly incorporated into an agency or
department's budget, or purchases that are encompassed within a defined budget
category, a department or agency head (or that person's designee) shall forward
requisitions or a request to advertise to the Purchasing Division for the
purchase of goods, services, construction, and professional services. The
Purchasing Agent may issue bids or other solicitations for any goods, service,
construction, or professional service for which funds have been budgeted.
   (B)   Non-budgeted purchases. For goods, services, construction, or
professional services that are not explicitly incorporated into an agency or
department's budget, an agency or department must first receive the written
approval of the County Administrator prior to any solicitation. The County
Administrator may designate this authority to the Chief Financial Officer.
   (C)   Inapplicability. This section does not apply to departmental
procurement (see § 33.068).

required by the county, except that specifications for any public works project
involving professional engineering shall be prepared by a professional
engineer. Specifications for construction and maintenance of highways, bridges,
and culverts shall be prepared by the Lake County Director of Transportation/
County Engineer. All specifications, including those prepared for the county by
architects, engineers, designers, and draftsmen, shall be drafted so as to
promote overall economy for the purposes intended and to encourage competition
in satisfying the county’s needs;
         (c)   Obtain expert advice and assistance from personnel of user
departments in the development of specifications and may delegate in writing to
a user department to prepare and utilize its own specifications; and
         (d)   Have discretion to select the appropriate method of construction
contracting management for a particular project. In determining which method to
use, the Purchasing Agent shall consider compliance with applicable county and
state laws, the county’s requirements, its resources, and the potential
contractor’s capabilities. For construction projects, the Purchasing Agent
shall include in the contract file a memorandum that sets forth the
considerations that led to the selection of the particular construction
management method that the County employed.
      (2)   Execute contracts and purchase orders based upon open competition
for all goods, services, construction, and professional services needed by the
county; and
      (3)   Establish a contract administration system to monitor compliance
and payments with specifications developed in cooperation with the agencies
using the goods, services, construction, and professional services; and
      (4)   Exercise general supervision over inventories of goods belonging to
the county:
         (a)   Establishing a surplus policy for the county to manage, sell,
trade, transfer, or otherwise dispose of surplus county property; and
         (b)   Allocating net proceeds from the sale, lease, or disposal of
surplus goods back to the appropriate fund.
   (C)   Purchasing regulations and operational procedures. Consistent with
this subchapter, and with the approval of the Financial and Administrative
Committee of the County Board, the Purchasing Agent may adopt purchasing
regulations and operational procedures relating to the execution of his or her
duties and may also suggest amendments to the Lake County Purchasing Ordinance
(codified as §§ 33.001 through 33.137), as necessary.
   (D)   Purchasing determinations. The Purchasing Agent shall work
cooperatively with departments in making determinations relative to the
purchase of goods, services, construction, and professional services.
   (E)   Authorization fo the use of electronic transmissions. The use of

Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
COMPETITIVE BIDDING
§ 33.035 GENERAL.
   An openly publicized competitive process is the most effective means of
determining the lowest cost from a responsible source, and such a process shall
be utilized whenever possible when procuring goods, services, construction, and
professional services. Competitive sealed bidding is required for the following
categories of goods and services:
   (A)   $30,000.
      (1)   For purchases of goods, services, and construction in excess of
$30,000 or for multiple purchases of the same item that will cumulatively
exceed $30,000 or for purchases with a single vendor within a fiscal year are
likely to exceed $30,000.
      (2)   If a contract with a vendor is for less than $30,000 (“Contract
1"), but a department or agency seeks to use that same vendor again within the
same budgetary year for a different contract (“Contract 2"), and Contract 1 and
Contract 2 will cumulatively exceed the $30,000 threshold, then the Purchasing
Agent shall first determine whether the two contracts are independent from one
another and not being used with the intent to evade the county’s bidding
requirements. The determination shall be made in writing and kept in the
contract file.
   (B)   $35,000. For data processing equipment (computers), software, or
services and telecommunications and inter-connect equipment, software, and
services: contracts in excess of $35,000.
   (C)   For professional services contracts, refer to §
33.050.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 4-101, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.036 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Invitation for bids.  An invitation for bids shall be issued and shall
include specifications, and all material contractual terms and conditions
applicable to the procurement.
   (B)   Public notice. Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be
given, and the notice shall set a date for the opening of bids that is at least
ten days afte rht notice is made public. The notice shall include publication
in a newspaper of general circulation within the county and internet posting on
the county website. The public notice shall state the place, date, and time of
bid opening and specifications for the invitation to bid or request for
proposal.
   (C)   Standard clauses and their modification. The Purchasing Agent, after
consultation with the State’s Attorney, may establish standard contract clauses
for use in county contracts.
   (D)   Bid security and performance and payment bonds on goods or service
contracts.
      (1)   Bid and performance bonds or other security shall be requested for
public contracts when provided by statute. Bid and performance bonds or other
security for supply and service contracts may be requested as the Purchasing
Agent deems advisable to protect the county’s interests. Any such bonding
requirements for supply and service contracts shall be set forth in the
invitation to bid or request for proposal as established by the Purchasing
Agent.
      (2)   Acceptable forms of security which may be submitted are: an
executed surety bond issued by a company or companies qualified to do business
in the State of Illinois with an A.M. Best Rating of at least A-; cash,
certified check or cashier’s check made payable to Lake County; an irrevocable
letter of credit; or any other form of deposit issued by a financial
institution and acceptable to the county. Personal or company checks are not
acceptable.
      (3)   Bid security shall be in an amount not to exceed 10% of the amount
of the bid/offer.
      (4)   Contract performance and payment bonds: upon receipt of the award
letter the required performance bonds or payment bonds shall be delivered to
the county and shall become binding on the parties upon the execution of the
contract.
   (E)   Insurance requirements on goods or service contracts. The Purchasing
Agent shall determine, in consultation with the risk manager, whether insurance
coverage by the contractor shall be required, and, if so, the types and amounts
of coverage that shall be required. The contractor shall have the county named
as an additional insured as its interest may appear and furnish the Purchasing
Agent with satisfactory evidence of the insurance.
   (F)   Contractor record retention. The Illinois Prevailing Wage Act imposes
recordkeeping requirements on contractors, 820 ILCS 130/1 et seq. For all
contracts awarded for public works construction, the contractor and all sub-
contractors shall be required to maintain adequate records appropriate to the
type of contract, to retain such records for a minimum of five years from final
payment, unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, and to make such
records available for the county’s inspection upon reasonable terms and
consistent with state law. To receive payment for contracts subject to the
Illinois Prevailing Wage Act, the contractor shall also be required to submit
confirmation from the Illinois Department of Labor that they have met the
filing requirements for certified payroll.
   (G)   Cancellation or rejection of invitations for bids or requests. An
invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or any other solicitation may be
canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part
as may be specified in the solicitation, when it is for good cause and in the
best interests of the county. The reasons for the cancellation or rejection
shall be made part of the contract file and shall be provided to bidders or
offerors upon request.
   (H)   Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or
more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The
amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the Purchasing Agent
deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded on a
bid tab. The bid tab shall be made available to the public.
   (I)   Late bids. No bids received after the time specified in the invitation
for bids will be considered. All bids received after the specified time will be
returned unopened to the bidder.
   (J)   Correction or withdrawal of bids: cancellation of awards. Correction
or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening, or
cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be
permitted where appropriate. Mistakes that a bidder be corrected or the bid may
be withdrawn before bid opening may be withdrawn by written notice received in
the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to the time set for the
bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to
the extent that the bidder can show by clear and convincing evidence that a
mistake of a non-judgmental character was made, the nature of
the mistake, and the bid price actually intended. After bid opening, no changes
in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the
county or fair competition shall be permitted.
      (1)   In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake
of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if:
         (a)   The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document,
but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or
         (b)   The bidder submits evidence which clearly and convincingly
demonstrates that a mistake was made.
      (2)   All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids, or to
cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a
written determination made by the Purchasing Agent.
      (3)   In the event of a discrepancy between the unit price and the
extended total, the unit price bid shall prevail.
   (K)   Bid evaluation. Consistent with the provisions of 55 ILCS 5/5-1022,
bids shall be evaluated based on their responsiveness to the requirements set
forth in the invitation for bids, and the demonstrated responsibility of the
bidder, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as
inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, experience, past performance,
financial stability, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. The
invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No
criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation
for bids. Alternative bids may be considered and accepted provided they are
specifically provided for in the invitation for bids and meet the evaluation
criteria set forth therein and are in the best interest of the county.
   (L)   Tie bids. If two or more bids meeting the specifications and other
requirements of the bid information are tied for low price, the bids will be
treated as follows.
      (1)   If there is significant difference in the responsibility of the
bidders (including ability to deliver in the quantity and at the time
required), the award will be made to the bidder who is deemed to be the most
responsible.
      (2)   If there is no significant difference in the responsibility of the
bidders, but there is difference in the quality of the commodities or services
offered, the bid offering the best quality will be accepted.
      (3)   If there is no significant difference in the responsibility of the
bidders and no difference in the quality of the items or services offered, the
bid offering the earliest delivery time will be accepted if delivery as early
as possible was a bid criteria. In all other cases, delivery time will not be
considered in making awards so long as the bidder states that delivery will
occur not later than the time specified in the bid information as the latest
acceptable delivery time.
      (4)   If the bids quoting the same price are equal in every respect, then
the Purchasing Agent may make the award based on their determination of what is
in the best interest of the county or otherwise by lot.
   (M)   Determination of non-responsibility of bidder and offerors.
Determinations of non-responsibility shall be made by the Purchasing Agent and
the bases for such determinations can include, but are not limited to: failure
to satisfy one or more of the criteria set forth in the definition of
“responsible bidder or offeror”contained in § 33.005, failure to perform or
unsatisfactory performance documented on one or more prior county contracts;
unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly supply information or
samples in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility; or
debarment by the State of Illinois or the United States of America. If a bidder
or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found non-
responsible, then the Purchasing Agent will make a written determination of
non-responsibility that sets forth the basis of the finding. A copy of the
determination shall be sent promptly to the non-responsible bidder or offeror,
and the final determination will be made part of the contract file.
   (N)   Award. The contract shall be awarded by appropriate written notice to
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, if the bid is within the amount
of funds appropriated. The Purchasing Agent is authorized to negotiate an
adjustment in the bid price with the low responsive and responsible bidder,
without changing the specifications of the bid.
      (1)   Prior to award, for contracts in excess of $100,000, the Purchasing
Agent shall request that the State’s Attorney review prior to award all
contracts in excess of $100,000. This threshold amount is for annual contract
value for reoccuring operating costs and the full contract value if services
extend more than one year. This review shall not be required when the form and
content of the contract documents have previously been approved by the State’s
Attorney.
      (2)   Except as provided in subsection (N)(3) below, the standing
committee in charge of the contracting department or agency and the Financial
and Administrative Committee shall, by resolution, jointly submit their
recommendation about the award of a contract above $30,000 or more for goods or
capital equipment and contracts of $35,000 or more for data processing and
telecommunications equipment, services and software, and submit the
recommendation for consideration at a regularly scheduled County Board meeting.
After award by the County Board, contracts shall be signed by the Purchasing
Agent.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (N)(2) above, the
Purchasing Agent is authorized to award and to sign contracts, other than sole
source or emergency contracts, for the purchase of goods or capital equipment
within the amount specifically authorized in the budget, without submitting
these contracts for committee and County Board approval.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (N)(2) above,
department heads are authorized to award and sign professional services
contracts, less than $50,000 pursuant to §§ 33.050 and 33.051, of less than
$50,000.
      (5)   Consistent with 55 ILCS 5/5-1130 and in addition to the authority
in subsection (N)(3) above, the Purchasing Agent is authorized to award and to
sign contracts that extend for five years for existing data processing and
telecommunications equipment, services and software that has been specifically
authorized in the budget without submitting these contracts for Committee and
County Board approval. This authority does not include renewals that contain
implementation services.
   (O)   Right to inspect plant. The county may, at reasonable times, inspect
the part of the plant, place of business, or worksite of a contractor or
subcontractor at any tier which is pertinent to the performance of any contract
awarded or to be awarded by the county.
   (P)   Right to audit records.
      (1)   Audit of contract costs. The county may, at reasonable times and
places, audit the books and records of any contractor to the extent that the
books, documents, papers, and records are pertinent to a county contract. Any
person or entity contracting with the county, shall maintain the books,
documents, papers, and records related to a county contract for three years
from the date of final payment. Language shall be included in the county’s
invitation to bid and its contract to ensure enforceability of this subsection.
      (2)   Contract audit. The county shall be entitled to audit the books and
records of a contractor or a subcontractor at any tier under any negotiated
contract or subcontract other than a firm fixed price contract to the extent
that the books, documents, papers, and records are pertinent to the performance
of the contract or subcontract. The books and records shall be maintained by
the contractor or subcontractor for a period of three years from the date of
final payment.
   (Q)   Reporting of anti-competitive practices. When collusion or other
anticompetitive practices are suspected among any bidders or offerors, a notice
of the relevant facts shall be transmitted to the State’s Attorney.
   (R)   County procurement records.
      (1)   Contract file. All determinations and other written records
pertaining to the solicitation, award, and performance of a contract shall be
maintained for the county in a contract file in the Purchasing Division.
      (2)   Retention of procurement records. All procurement records shall be
retained and disposed of by the county in accordance with records retention
guidelines and schedules approved by the Illinois Local Records Commission.
   (S)   Multi-step sealed bidding.
      (1)   When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase
description to support an award based on price, a multi-step sealed bid may be
used if the Purchasing Agent determines the following:
         (a)   Available specifications or purchase descriptions are not
sufficiently complete to permit full competition without technical evaluations
and discussions to ensure mutual understanding between the bidder and the
county;
         (b)   Definite criteria exist for evaluation of technical offers;
         (c)   More than one technically qualified source is expected to be
available; and
         (d)   A fixed unit price contract will be used.
      (2)   Multi-step sealed bidding shall be conducted in two phases: first,
non-priced technical offers shall be evaluated; second, priced bids shall be
considered, but only from those bidders whose non- priced technical offers were
found unacceptable under the first step. Non-priced technical offers shall be
evaluated solely in accordance with the criteria set forth in the invitation to
submit technical offers and shall be determined to be either acceptable or
potentially acceptable for further consideration or unacceptable.
Determinations that a non-priced technical proposal is unacceptable shall be in
writing and state the basis of the determination. The determination shall be
retained in the procurement file, and the bidder shall be notified that it will
not be afforded an opportunity to amend its technical offer.
      (3)   Upon completion of step one, an invitation to bid shall be issued
under the provisions of §§
33.035 and
33.036; except that, the invitation for bid shall be issued only to bidders
whose technical offers were determined to be acceptable in step one.
   (T)   Electronic reverse auctions. The Purchasing Agent may procure
materials, equipment, and services with an electronic reverse auction company,
in accordance with the Local Government Electronic Reverse Auction Act(50 ILCS
530/1 et seq.), if the Purchasing Agent determines that such a process will
provide the best value to the county (or that all purchasing methods provide
equal value). Vendors interested in participating in the reverse auction shall
be pre-qualified to meet the specifications and must agree to the county’s
terms and conditions for the bid prior to the start of the auction. During the
auction, a bidder’s price shall be disclosed to other bidders and those
participating bidders shall have an opportunity to reduce their bid prices
during the auction. At the conclusion of the auction, the record of the bid
prices received, and the name of each bidder shall be open to public
inspection.
   (U)   Multiple source contracting.
      (1)   Multiple source contracting involves awarding to more than one
bidder a contract for an indefinite quantity for one or more similar supplies
or services. A multiple source award may be made when the Purchasing Agent
determines that it is in the county’s best interest that two or more bidders be
awarded a contract for similar products or services of an indefinite quantity.
      (2)   Multiple source awards shall not be made when a single award will
meet the county’s needs without sacrificing economy or service. Multiple source
awards shall not be made solely for the purpose of dividing the business among
suppliers or resolving tie bids. Multiple source awards shall be limited to the
least number of suppliers necessary to meet the county’s requirements without
sacrificing economy and service.
   (V)   Bid addenda and questions. Once bid document has been issued, all
questions regarding the document shall be submitted in writing to the
Purchasing Division. All addenda shall be issued by the Purchasing Division
pursuant to specifications in the bid document. If it is determined that a
bidder received an unfair advantage from information obtained through other
departments or agencies, the bid may be canceled.
   (W)   Communication with bidders. Consistent with the Lake County Ethics
Ordinance and the statute on Public Contracts in the Illinois Criminal Code
(720 ILCS 5/33E-6), county officers and employees shall limit communications
with bidders during the solicitation process so that the integrity of the
competitive solicitation process is maintained. If it is determined that a
bidder received unfair advantage from information obtained from prohibited
sources or under prohibited circumstances, the solicitation may be canceled, or
the bidder disqualified from participation in that solicitation request.
   (X)   Accepting single bid received. If only one responsive bid is received
after a competitive solicitation, the county may, after determining whether the
bidder is responsible, accept the bid.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 4-102, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Res. passed 2-10-2015; Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS
§ 33.050 GENERAL.
   (A)   Department heads, agencies and/or elected officials shall have the
authority to award professional services contracts of less than $50,000 and may
determine, in their discretion, whether such contracts will be awarded on the
basis of competitive sealed proposals. Professional services contracts for
$50,000 or greater or where multiple professional services contracts for the
same item and/or with a single vendor within a fiscal year are likely to exceed
$50,000 will be subject to the competitive sealed proposals provisions pursuant
to §
33.051, unless they meet one of the exceptions and/or requirements enumerated
in §§
33.065 through
33.069, or unless they fall within the scope of subsection (C) below. All
contracts that fall within the scope of subsection (C) below shall be awarded
on the basis of qualification-based factors rather than price and will follow
the statement of interest procedures according to the Local Government
Professional Services Selection Act (50 ILCS 510/1 et seq.) rather than a
competitive bid or a competitive sealed proposal.
   (B)   For professional services contracts for $50,000 or greater, the
respective department head and the Purchasing Agent shall present a joint
recommendation to the County Board for consideration and approval.
   (C)   All professional services contracts relative to engineering,
architectural and land surveying services will be governed by the requirements
of the Local Government Professional Services Selection Act (50 ILCS 510/1 et
seq.). In the event the county does not have a satisfactory relationship with
one or more firms, a statement of interest shall be issued for the initial
selection of engineering, architectural, or land surveying services with
evaluation based on qualifications such as ability of professional personnel,
past record and experience, performance data on file, willingness to meet
requirements, location, workload of the firm, work on similar projects, past
performance and other applicable qualification-based factors, but excluding
consideration of price or compensation. Responders are then ranked in order of
preference and contract negotiations are initiated with the firms individually
in order of preference. A request for statement of interest is not required for
contracts up to $25,000 regardless of the existence or non-existence of a
satisfactory relationship with one or more firms. In all cases, a written
description of scope of services to be provided shall be prepared and used as
the basis of contract negotiations.
   (D)   Contracts, other than professional services contracts, in which the
Purchasing Agent determines that competitive sealed bidding is neither
practical nor advantageous, may be entered into by a competitive sealed
proposal.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 5-101, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013)
§ 33.051 PROCEDURES.
   Competitive sealed requests for proposals (RFP) shall be initiated and
created in accordance with the procedures for competitive sealed bidding as
enumerated in §§
33.035 and
33.036 except as follows.
   (A)   Proposals shall not be publicly opened, and the register of proposals
shall be available for public inspection only after contract execution.
   (B)   Fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for
discussion and revision of proposals and any revisions may be permitted after
submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final
offers.
   (C)   RFP addenda and questions. Once the RFP document has been issued, all
questions regarding the document shall be submitted in writing to the
Purchasing Division. Any and all addenda shall be issued by the Purchasing
Division and pursuant to specifications in the RFP document. If it is
determined that a bidder received an unfair advantage from information obtained
through other departments or agencies, the RFP may be canceled.
   (D)   Communication with proposers. County officers and employees shall take
care to limit communication with proposers during the solicitation process so
that the integrity of the competitive solicitation process is maintained. All
representatives of the county shall avoid any vendor contact that would
constitute interference with contract submission and award under the Criminal
Code, 720 ILCS 5/33E-6. If it is determined that a proposer received unfair
advantage from information obtained from prohibited sources or under prohibited
circumstances, the solicitation may be canceled, or the proposer disqualified
from participation in the solicitation request.

PURCHASES EXEMPT FROM BIDDING AND COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS
§ 33.065 GENERAL.
   This section applies to and details the requirements for purchases that, for
various reasons, may be exempt from the competitive sealed bid process. Despite
the exemptions, competitive pricing shall be encouraged and/or a cost or price
analysis shall be conducted prior to award of contracts under this section
whenever possible.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 6-101, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013)
§ 33.066 BID EXEMPTION.
   (A)   If a department head conducts a good faith review of available sources
and determines that the contract by its very nature is not suitable to
competitive bids or proposals, he or she shall forward an exemption request to
the Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent will review and approve all
exemption requests. The Purchasing Agent may consult with ad hoc groups of
county staff in making his or her determination with regard to a particular
procurement. If the Purchasing Agent reviews and approves the department head’s
recommendation that the procurement is exempt from competitive bids or
proposals, the department is not required to employ the competitive proposal or
bidding process to enter into a contract. A written determination for the basis
for the bid exemption shall be made by the Purchasing Agent and included in the
contract file.
   (B)   Examples of contracts that may not be suitable for competitive bids or
proposals fall into the following categories:
      (1)   Single source. There is only one source for the required goods,
service, or construction item;
      (2)   Professional services. There exists a long-standing, successful
relationship for professional services, and the knowledge gained through this
relationship adds value integral to the services provided;
      (3)   Trail use or testing. A sole- supplier’s item is needed for trial
use or testing;
      (4)   Used equipment. The purchase is for used equipment; and
      (5)   Auctions. The purchase is made at auctions.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 6-102, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.067 EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT.
   An emergency justifying a departure from the standard rules set forth in
this chapter shall be deemed to exist when there arises a threat to the public
health, welfare, or safety, or there is a need to prevent or minimize serious
disruption of government services. Emergency procurements shall be made with
any competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written
determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the
particular contractor shall be certified by the appropriate department head,
forwarded to the Purchasing Agent, and included in the contract file. A
confirming resolution, along with the written determination, shall be submitted
to the County Board for all emergency procurements of greater than $30,000 for
goods, equipment and services; or greater than $35,000 for data processing and
telecommunications equipment, software and services; and greater than $50,000
for professional services.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 6-103, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.068 DEPARTMENTAL PROCUREMENT.
   (A)   Departmental procurements shall be made in accordance with the county
or other government contracts whenever possible. For non-contract purchases,
department heads or their designees are encouraged to obtain competitive
quotations for purchases of goods, services or construction up to $5,000, or up
to $50,000 for professional services, are encouraged by the department head or
their designee to determine the source that is in the county’s best interests.
   (B)   For purchases between $5,000 to $30,000 (or $35,000 for data
processing and telecommunications equipment, software and services), the
Purchasing Agent or the agent’s designee shall document quotations from at
least three vendors whenever feasible.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 6-104, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;
Ord. 21-0923, passed 10-12-2021)
§ 33.069 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Solicitation factors. Three quotations shall be received whenever
possible prior to the contract. Circumstances may exist where the Purchasing
Agent or the agent’s designee determines that it is not feasible to secure
three quotations. In other situations, the Purchasing Agent or the agent’s
designee may determine that it is in the best interests of the county to
consider only one supplier who has previous expertise relative to a
procurement. Whenever the Purchasing Agent or the Agent’s designee determines
that it is not feasible, or is not in the county’s best interests, to satisfy
the minimum quotation requirements of this section, the reason for this
determination shall be indicated in writing and retained in the contract file.
The department or agency head shall conduct negotiations, as appropriate, as to
price, delivery, and terms.
   (B)   Evaluation factors. Evaluation factors that may justify an award to a
vendor who has not provided the lowest quotation include, without limitation,
delivery requirements, quantity requirements, quality, and past vendor
performance. Whenever the Purchasing Agent or the Agent’s designee determines
that it is in the county’s best interests to award a small purchase contract to
a vendor who did not submit the lowest quote, the reason for this determination
shall be indicated in writing and retained in the contract file.
   (C)   Contract administration. Adequate records to document the competition
solicited and award determination made shall be retained in the contract file
managed by the department or agency. A quote that exceeds the applicable bid
limit ($30,000, $35,000 or $50,000, as the case may be) shall not be eligible
for award under this section. In a situation where all responsible quotations
exceed the bid limit, all quotes shall be rejected, and formal bidding
procedures shall be followed.

the county. Requisitions processed for grants are processed so as to facilitate
the method of payment and do not require any of the normal procedures or
approvals under this chapter, unless stipulated by the grant.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION AND CONTRACT TERM
§ 33.080 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   A system for contract administration is designed to ensure that the
contractor is performing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
contract. Contract administration results may be used by the Purchasing Agent
for vendor evaluation.
   (A)   The department or agency involved in the contract is responsible for
matching contract terms and prices with invoices, and to otherwise monitor
compliance with the contract terms. The department or agency is also
responsible for determining the need for any change orders where appropriate,
and for starting the process to obtain such an order.
   (B)   The Purchasing Division will maintain a database of executed contracts
and work with departments and agencies to monitor renewal options, the
contractor’s compliance with terms and conditions and the parties’ satisfaction
with overall contract performance.
   (C)   Departments and agencies experiencing difficulty in contract
performance shall submit a written request to the Purchasing Agent to evaluate
the parties’ compliance with the contract terms and conditions. The Purchasing
Agent or the agent’s designee shall communicate with the vendor and assist in
negotiating a resolution to whatever barriers to contract performance exist.
   (D)   Invoices must be identified to an existing contract or purchase order
before payment is issued.
(1977 Code, § 1:4-1) (Ord., § 7-101, passed 12-8-2009; Ord. passed 2-12-2013;

§ 33.081 CONTRACT TERM.
   (A)   Specified period. Unless otherwise provided by statute, a contract for
goods or services may generally only extend for two years, provided the term of
the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in
the solicitation and funds are available for the first fiscal period at the
time of contracting. As a matter of policy, contracts may contain automatic
renewal provisions if it is in the best interest of the county, but for any
renewal period beyond two years (or any applicable statutory timeframe that is
longer than two years), the County Board must have the ability to terminate the
contract within a time not to exceed 90 days after the renewal period begins.
The total contract term for any contract, including the time periods by which
the contract is extended due to renewal, shall not exceed five years, unless a
unique capital investment or other extenuating factors necessitate a longer
contract period and it is approved by Board resolution.
   (B)   Cancellation due to unavailability of funds in succeeding fiscal
periods. When funds are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support
continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall
be canceled.

§ 33.082 CHANGE ORDERS AND CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   When the total of change orders, contract modifications, or price
adjustments on any contract approved by resolution of the County Board exceeds
10% of the original contract amount, approval of the standing committee in
charge of the contracting department or agency and the Financial and
Administrative Committee is required.
   (B)   When a change order or series of change orders authorize or
necessitate an increase or decrease in either the cost of a contract by a total
of $10,000 or more, or the time of completion by a total of 30 days or more,
the authorized employee or official shall make a determination in writing that:
      (1)   The circumstances giving rise to the change in performance were not
reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was signed;
      (2)   The change is germane to the original contract as signed; or
      (3)   The change order is in the best interests of the county and
authorized by law.
   (C)   The written determination and the written change order resulting from
that determination shall be retained in the contract file which shall be open
to the public for inspection.
   (D)   (1)   The Purchasing Agent is authorized to sign all change orders and
to consent to contract assignments.
      (2)   Additionally, the County Engineer is authorized to sign change
orders for projects relating to planning, design, construction, and maintenance
of highways, bridges, and culverts.
      (3)   The Superintendent of Public Works is authorized to sign change
orders relating to planning, design, construction, and maintenance of water and
sewer projects.
      (4)   The Director of Facilities and Construction Services is authorized
to sign change orders relating to planning and design (those relating to
services provided by engineers, architects and land surveyors under the Local
Government Professional Services Selection Act (50 ILCS 510/1 et seq.) and on
such other projects that the County Administrator has designated to the
Director of Facilities and Construction Services.
      (5)   As required by the Public Works Contract Change Order Act (50 ILCS
525/1 et seq.), when a change order for any public works contract necessitates
any increase in the contract price that is 50% or more of the original contract
price or that authorizes or necessitates any increase in the price of a
subcontract under the contract that is 50% or more of the original subcontract
price, then the portion of the contact that is covered by the change order must
be resubmitted for bidding in the same manner in which the original contract
was bid.

interest may be, in a land trust, held by a trustee for the benefit of
beneficiaries of the land trust.
      LAND TRUST. Any express agreement or arrangement whereby a use,

subject of a land trust or represented by the trust document that is filed for

included in the basis of computing the tax.
      (2)   The taxes shall be collected by the Recorder of Deeds or Registrar

of Deeds or Registrar of Titles shall sell the revenue stamps at a rate of
$0.25 per $500 of value or fraction thereof. Provided, however, that until such
a time as the County Board has prescribed the design, denominations, and form
of county revenue stamps and provided the stamps to the Recorder of Deeds, the

initials and the day, month, and year when the affixing occurred. The markings
shall be made by writing or stamping in indelible ink or by perforating with a

land trust, a fully executed and completed copy of any instrument or facsimile

any taxes imposed pursuant to this amended section.
   (E)   All proceeds resulting from the collection of the taxes imposed by
this amended section shall be paid to the Lake County Treasurer.
   (F)   The taxes herein imposed shall be in addition to all other occupation
or privilege taxes imposed by the state or by any municipal corporation or
political subdivision hereof.

PROCEDURE FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE AND TAX
CERTIFICATES ACQUIRED
BY THE COUNTY OF LAKE, AS TRUSTEE, FOR THE RESPECTIVE TAXING DISTRICTS THROUGH
THE TAX SALE
§ 37.047 BACKGROUND.
   Each year the county conducts a tax sale under the provisions o f the
Illinois Property Tax Code. For properties receiving no bids, the Illinois
Property Tax Code authorizes the County of Lake to act as trustee on behalf of
taxing districts and acquire the tax certificate without payment (each, a
“certificate”). 35 ILCS 200/21-90. The County of Lake as Trustee (“COLT”) then
administers the parcels for the benefit of the taxing districts, the
incorporated areas in which the parcels lie, and thus ultimately for Lake
County’s taxpayers. The Lake County Clerk, through its Tax Extension Division,
administers the Tax Sale Certificate Program.
   A primary goal of the tax sale program is to get properties acquired by tax
deed back on the tax rolls and into the ownership of someone who will regularly
pay the properties’ taxes. A secondary goal, consistent with 35 ILCS 200/21-90,
is to assist municipalities or similar units of local government in recapturing
and remedying derelict properties, particularly for those properties that have
created an economic burden for the municipalities in which they are located and
have a documented history of being unmarketable, or to foster affordable
housing organizations in Lake County. The following procedures are directed
toward these goals.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)

ascribed to them below.

is within the means of a household that may occupy moderate-income or low-
income housing. As a guide, such housing, whether rental or owner-occupied, is
generally that which costs no more than 30% of the gross annual household
income for a household of the size that may occupy the unit.
   AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATION. A not-for-profit and ta x-exempt entity,
limited equity cooperative, or public agency seeking to create affordable
housing.
   CLAIM. A monetary interest in a particular property by reason of the
advancement of public funds for property maintenance, nuisance abatement,
demolition or rehabilitation, und er either statutory or home rule authority.
   ELIGIBLE MUNICIPALITY. A municipality which has a claim against a particular
property.
   MUNICIPALITIES. Cities, villages and incorporated towns, either singularly
or jointly. A MUNICIPALITY may assign its rights under this chapter to an
entity organized by an intergovernmental agreement for the purpose of
assembling, managing and facilitating the redevelopment of abandoned, derelict
or foreclosed properties.
   QUALIFIED ENTITY. Either (i) an eligible municipality, or (ii) another
taxing body, or (iii) an affordable housing organization.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.049 ADMINISTRATION OF CERTIFICATES OF SALE BEFORE A COURT HAS GRANTED THE

provisions of 35 ILCS 200/21-90, the county may assign the certificate to any
interested party, including taxing districts. Prior to the county applying for
an order directing issuance of a tax deed, assignment shall be made to
nongovernmental purchasers only if the purchaser pays the outstanding tax lien.
   (B)   For governmental entities, the County Clerk may assign the certificate
for less than the outstanding tax lien and an eligible municipality may receive
a credit against the purchase rice equal to the value of its claim.

housing organization seeks to obtain, all properties acquired by tax deed will
be offered for sale by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
area in which the property is located.
   (B)   Publication will be made at least once per year, and properties will
be listed by municipality (or postal area if unincorporated) with street
address, permanent index number, and minimum bid (as defined under “Terms and
Conditions of Sale” set forth below).
   (C)   Sale to the successful bidder shall be in accordance with the “Terms
and Conditions of Sale” set forth below.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.052 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TO AN ELIGIBLE MUNICIPALITY, OTHER TAXING
BODY OR AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATION.
   (A)   These sale procedures shall apply to (i) an eligible municipality, or
(ii) another taxing body, or (iii) an affordable housing organization
(together, “qualified entity”).
   (B)   A qualified entity may submit a bid for any property on the list
described in §
37.049 for less than the minimum bid (as defined under “Terms and Conditions of
Sale” set forth below), but such bidders must, along with their bid amount,
submit a brief statement explaining why the entity should receive the property
for less than the minimum bid price, if the bid is below the minimum bid.
   (C)   The County Clerk may assign the certificate or convey a deed to a
qualified entity that submits a bid equal to or less than the minimum bid. The
County Clerk’s discretion to assign or convey for less than the minimum bid set
forth in §
37.052(B) shall be guided by the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the qualified entity has incurred significant costs to
maintain the property, where SIGNIFICANT shall be defined with reference to the
costs in relation to the minimum bid described in the “Terms of Sale” provision
below, with a 50% or greater ratio representing “significant costs”;
      (2)   Whether the qualified entity plans to use the property to create or
otherwise foster affordable housing;
      (3)   Whether the qualified entity plans to use the property on an
ongoing basis for a public purpose, including to foster economic development as
part of a broader plan that extends beyond the property in question;
      (4)   The likelihood of other bidders, who are not qualified entities,
seeking to acquire the property, and the amount of the tax revenue that would
be forgone annually by conveying the property to a qualified entity;
      (5)   The immediacy of the qualified entity’s plan to put the property
into productive or public use.
An eligible municipality or another taxing body may claim a credit against the
purchase price equal to the value of its claim in exchange for a release of the
claim. If the release must be recorded to be effective, the eligible
municipality or other taxing body shall pay the cost for recording the release.
   (D)   After receipt of payment, Lake County, as Trustee, will quit claim the
property to the qualified entity or, if payment occurs prior to the time for
issuance of a tax deed, then the county will assign its interest (including the
certificate) to the qualified entity.
   (E)   To ensure that evidence of title is promptly recorded, the County
Clerk will deliver the quitclaim deed to the Recorder’s Office, which will in
turn send the recorded deed to the purchaser.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.053 TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE.
   (A)   Offers to purchase a property must be made in writing by sealed bid
and submitted to the County Clerk, Tax Extension Department. Forms will be
available for this purpose. The permanent index number of the subject parcel
must be clearly identified on the outside of the sealed bid.
   (B)   In the first year in which the county offers a property for sale, the
minimum bid amount shall be the current equalized assessed value, increased by
the following: (a) 10%; plus (b) an additional amount equal to county expenses
for maintenance of such parcel, if any, incurred following acquisition of the
tax deed; plus (c) if requested, the value of an eligible municipality’s claim,
payable to the eligible municipality. (As set forth in §
37.052, the minimum bid requirement does not apply to a qualified entity.)
Additionally, the minimum bid amount shall not apply to bidders who own
property adjacent to (i.e., sharing a border with) the property upon which a
bid is submitted.
   (C)   Bids received for a parcel will be retained for 30 days after the
initial bid on the parcel. After the completion of the 30-day period, each bid
will be opened and evaluated.
   (D)   The County of Lake, Trustee, by and through the Lake County Clerk,
reserves the right to accept or reject any or all bids at any time, and
reserves the right to withdraw any parcel from the sale at any time. The County
Clerk shall have the authority to withdraw a parcel from the sale and direct
its conveyance to the previous owner or an interested party upon payment in
full of all amounts remaining unpaid, or to convey the parcel to a governmental
entity seeking to rehabilitate a derelict property, particularly where the
property has created an economic burden for the municipality in which it is
located. The exercise of such discretion shall be made by the County Clerk with
full consideration of principles governing the rights and responsibilities of
the County of Lake, Trustee, as set forth by applicable Illinois law. The
County Clerk may seek input from the Finance and Administration Committee of
the County Board, but any such consultation shall not bind the Clerk’s
discretion in disposing of property.
   (E)   The successful bidder will be required to pay the amount bid plus a
separate recording fee at the time and place of sale.
   (F)   The successful bidder is responsible for the current year’s general
real estate taxes, which will be billed in the following year, except for bids
from municipalities or similar units of local government, to which 35 ILCS 200/
21-95 or 35 ILCS 200/21-100 apply.
   (G)   After receipt of full payment, Lake County, as Trustee, will quitclaim
the property to the successful bidder or, if payment occurs prior to the time
for issuance of a tax deed, then the county will assign its interest (including
the certificate) to the successful bidder.
   (H)   To ensure that evidence of title is promptly recorded, the County
Clerk will deliver the quitclaim deed to the Recorder’s Office, which will in
turn send the recorded deed to the purchaser.

§ 37.054 PAYMENT POLICY.
   Payment can be made by cash, money order, cashier’s check, or certified
check, with checks made payable to “County of Lake, Trustee.”
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.055 DISPOSITION OF PARCELS NOT BID.
   Consistent with these procedures, it is in the best interest of the public
that property acquired by tax deed be returned to the tax rolls in a timely
manner or otherwise serve a public interest (e.g., a municipal purchase).
   (A)   All parcels that are not bid upon will remain in the inventory and
will continue to be offered for sale.
   (B)   For parcels receiving no minimum bids after their initial offering and
continuing to be held in inventory for sale for six months, the minimum bid
requirement may be lifted, but the County Clerk may require a successful bidder
to cover any expenses that the county has incurred for maintenance of the
property, as well as the value of any eligible municipality’s Claim.
   (C)   The County of Lake, Trustee, reserves the right to accept or reject
any or all bids and withdraw any parcel from the sale at any time.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.056 DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS.
   (A)   Where the proceeds from the property sale are less than the taxes
owed, such proceeds will be distributed on a pro rata basis to the respective
taxing bodies. Such distributions shall be handled by the Lake County
Treasurer’s Office through its normal tax process.
   (B)   Except as descried in division (C), where the proceeds are more than
the taxes owed, the amount in excess will accrue to the County Corporate Fund
to offset program expenses, and as otherwise permitted by statute.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.057 PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.

be managed as permitted by statute.
(Ord. 21-0420, passed 3-9-2021)
§ 37.058 EFFECT OF OTHER ORDINANCES OR LAWS.
   (A)   Property acquired by tax deed is subject to the Lake County Ordinance
titled “Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds,” codified
in
Chapter 37 of the Lake County Code of Ordinances.
   (B)   Where there is evidence of encroachment or other continuing use and
efforts to sell the property have failed, the County Clerk shall consult with

   (A)   Grounds for alternative permit. The Buildings Manager may refuse to
issue a permit as requested and may instead authorize the activity at a date,
time, or location or in a manner different from that described in the
application, if the Buildings Manager finds that:
      (1)   A permit application for a different location at the same time has
already been granted, or has been received and will be granted, or another
event is scheduled elsewhere in the county, and the police resources required
for that prior activity are so great that in combination with the subsequent
proposed activity, the resulting deployment of police services would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property; or
      (2)   The activity, as proposed, poses an unreasonable risk of harm to

building and this use is intended to influence or impede the judicial
proceeding;
      (10)   Is being conducted with a permit issued in response to an
intentionally false or incomplete application;
      (11)   Violates any of the conditions or standards set forth in this
subchapter or any permit issued hereunder; or
      (12)   When a public emergency arises when police resources required for
that emergency are so great that deployment of police services for the activity
would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of
persons and property.

permit. Upon initiating action to disapprove an application or to cancel an
issued permit for any of the above reasons, the Buildings Manager shall:

to disapprove or cancel and the reasons for this action; and

charge. The applicant shall reimburse the county for costs of labor and/or
services over and above those normally provided. An advance deposit may be
required based upon the Buildings Manager’s reasonable estimate of the
additional costs associated with the labor and/or services requested. If the
applicant desires to provide services, such as security and cleaning, this
request must be approved by the Financial and Administrative Committee who may
decide to provide the services free of charge if the cost is insignificant and
if it is in the public’s interest.
   (B)   Alterations of public area. Generally, there shall be no alteration to
designated public areas used under these regulations by persons, firms, or
organizations, unless it is determined by the Financial and Administrative
Committee that changes should be made in a public building to encourage and aid
in the proposed use. The permittee must make adequate provisions for:

      (2)   Denial. If it is determined that the C&D Debris Compliance Plan is
incomplete or fails to demonstrate that at least 75% of all C&D debris
generated by the covered project will be diverted, the C&D Debris Compliance
Plan shall be returned to the applicant marked “failed”. Upon the return of the
C&D Debris Compliance Plan, the applicant may make necessary changes and
resubmit the C&D Debris Compliance Plan or request a variance, in writing, from
the requirements of this section, to be approved by the PB&D Director, in
consultation with SWALCO.
   (E)   C&D debris compliance report. Not less than ten business days prior to
the scheduled date for the final inspection of a covered project subject to
this section, the applicant shall complete and submit the C&D Debris Compliance
Report provided by PB&D. The C&D Debris Compliance Report must include the
following information:
      (1)   The date(s) demolition and/or construction commenced;
      (2)   The weight of C&D debris that was generated at the project site;

complied with subsection (A) above, enforcement shall occur under the terms of
§
50.99(B).

been achieved due to extraordinary circumstances, the applicant may request a
variance, in writing, from the requirements of §
50.04, to be approved by the PB&D Director, in consultation with SWALCO.
   (G)   Variance criteria. The PB&D Director may grant a variance from the
requirements of §
50.04 only if the PB&D Director finds that all of the following have been met.
      (1)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applicable to
the project that do not apply to similar projects and that make compliance with
the section impracticable.
      (2)   Granting the variance will not constitute a grant of special
privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on similar covered projects.
      (3)   Cost to the applicant of strict compliance with this section is not
the primary reason for granting the exception.

§ 51.22 LIABILITY; LATE PAYMENT; DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   Enforcement Officer. All sections of this subchapter shall be enforced
by the Director of the Lake County Public Works Department, or his or her
designees.
   (B)   Liability. The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof, or the
user of the service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for all
service to such premises, and service is furnished to the premises by the
county only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant, or
user of any service are jointly and severally liable therefor to the County of
Lake.
   (C)   Liability for undercharges and overcharges. In the event that there is
an undercharge for service by reason of either an error involving billing
procedures or metering equipment discrepancies, such undercharge shall be
billed to the user, owner or occupant and collected by the county, provided,
however, that the period of undercharge accumulation shall not exceed 12
months. In the event that there is an overcharge for service by reason of
either an error involving billing procedures or metering equipment
discrepancies, such overcharge shall be credited to the user, owner or occupant
by the county, provided, however, that the period of overcharge accumulation
shall not exceed 12 months.
   (D)   Late payments, penalty. If payment of the entire amount of a bill for
sewer and/or water service is not received by the County of Lake on or before
the twentieth day after the billing date, then a late payment penalty of 10% of
the unpaid balance of the bill shall be added thereto and become due and
payable.
   (E)   Delinquency. In the event the sewer and/or water service charges
including any penalty then due are not paid within 60 days after the date of
billing, such charges and penalty shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be
delinquent. Such delinquency shall be a violation of this subchapter and
subject to enforcement and imposition of fines. Pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/5-43035,
the county has the authority to charge a late fee to cover any fees or costs
incurred by the county for carrying and collecting delinquent payments, with
respect to attorneys or private collection agents retained by the county. A
cost of collections fee of 35% of the unpaid balance due shall be applied to
the unpaid balance of the bill and become immediately due and payable.
   (F)   Shut off. If sewer and/or water service charges are determined to be
delinquent or an unauthorized connection is made, the water or sewer service
may be shut off by the Director of the Lake County Department of Public Works.
Water and/or sewer service will not be turned on until all payment, penalties
and fees have been paid.
   (G)   Warning of Ordinance Violation. If any charges and/or penalties are
declared to be delinquent, the Enforcement Officer shall have the authority to
issue a Warning of Ordinance Violation. The Warning shall, at a minimum,
identify the violation for which it is being issued, shall include the address
at which the violation has occurred, shall allow the respondent to elect to pay
all outstanding charges and/or penalties to abate the violation(s) within a
reasonable time, and shall state that a Notice of Ordinance Violation may be
issued if the warning is not adhered to as specified.
   (H)   Notice of Ordinance Violation; Administrative Adjudication. If an
individual has previously been issued a Warning of Ordinance Violation or is in
violation of §
51.21 and the individual fails to pay all outstanding charges and/or penalties
by the date specified in the warning, the Enforcement Officer shall have
authority to issue a Notice of Ordinance Violation. If Administrative
Adjudication is found to be the appropriate remedy to resolve the violation,
the notice must be served in accordance with and shall contain all information
specified and required in §§
94.50 through
94.66 (Lake County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance). Prior to the hearing
date documented on the Notice of Ordinance Violation, the respondent may elect
to pay all outstanding charges and/or penalties deemed delinquent, pay the fine
listed on the Notice of Ordinance Violation, and not participate in the
hearing.
   (I)   Liens.
      (1)   In the event the sewer and/or water service charges, including any
penalty, are declared to be delinquent, the County of Lake shall commence with
proceedings to create a lien upon the real estate to which water or sewerage
service is supplied through the delinquent account in accordance with the
county’s authority pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/5-15021. To create this lien, the
county shall send to the delinquent owner or owners of record of the real
estate, as referenced by the taxpayer’s property identification number:
         (a)   A copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is
delinquent in paying the charges or other notice sufficient to inform the owner
or owners of record; and
         (b)   A notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the
real estate pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/5-15021.
      (2)   In addition, the County shall file a notice of such lien in the
office of the Lake County Recorder of Deeds. This notice shall consist of a
statement sworn to by an authorized officer or employee of Lake County setting
out:
         (a)   A description of such real estate sufficient for the
identification thereof;
         (b)   The amount of money due for such water or sewerage service; and
         (c)   The date when such amount became delinquent.
      (3)   The county shall also send a copy of the notice of lien to the
owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer’s
property identification number. If all of the above requirements are met, the
county shall have the power to foreclose this lien in the same manner and with
the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate.

§ 51.28 LAKE COUNTY AMR METER OPT-OUT POLICY.
   (A)   In order to modernize meter reading and billing services available to
customers, Lake County is installing automated water meters (AMR) with
technology that transmits data back to the county offices. This technology uses
a meter transmitter that sends usage data from the customer’s meter. The meter
transmitter is connected by a wire and sends readings wirelessly utilizing
radio frequency.
   (B)   Despite the many advantages of the system, the county recognizes that
some customers may want to opt-out of the AMR technology. Public Works has
explored two options that could be made available to customers. (However, under
both options the existing meter must be replaced.)
      (1)   Option 1: meter transmitter installed on the outside of the house.
The standard location for the transmitter is in the basement ceiling or
crawlspace joist above the meter inside the house. As an alternative, the
transmitter can be wired to and installed on the outside of the house. The one-
time outside installation fee that will be billed to those customers who choose
the outside meter transmitter installation option is established in the Public
Work’s applicable ordinance, which shall be amended from time to time.
      (2)   Option 2: no meter transmitter - manual meter read. Under this
option, there would be no meter transmitter installed to send the meter data.
The customer would be responsible to send their water meter reading into the
Public Works office via phone or e-mail every two months, six times a year. The
county would travel to and enter the customer’s house and take a manual read of
meter usage twice a year. In order to cover the costs of manually reading the
meter, manually entering the meter data and travel costs, an annual charge
established in the Public Work’s applicable rate ordinance, which shall be
amended from time to time, would be assessed on water bills as a monthly
charge. As a consequence of this option, the customer would not benefit from
leak detection notification and usage data from the customer online portal.

   (C)   Applicability and jurisdiction. This chapter shall apply to all
premises served or supplied by public water systems owned and operated by Lake
County.
   (D)   Minimum requirements. The standards of this chapter are minimum
requirements. The issuance of any permit, certificate or approval in accordance
with the standards and requirements of this chapter shall not relieve the
recipient of such permit, certificate or approval from the responsibility of
complying with all other applicable requirements of any other local, county,
state or federal agency, having jurisdiction over the structures or land uses
for which the permit, certificate or approval was issued.
   (E)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to define and set forth the
regulations of the county concerning connection to, use, and maintenance of its
public water supply system and inspection and maintenance of water services
connected directly or indirectly thereto.
   (F)   Word usages and construction of language.
      (1)   Meanings and intent. All provisions, terms, phrases and expressions
contained in this chapter shall be construed according to the purpose set out
in division (E).
      (2)   Headings, illustrations and text. In case of any difference of
meaning or implication between the text of this chapter and any heading,
drawing, table, figure, or illustration, the text shall control unless such
heading, drawing, table, figure, or illustration is deemed by the Public Works
Director to provide greater protection to the safe, efficient, and effective
operation of the public water supply system.
      (3)   Lists and examples. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, lists
of items or examples that use terms such as "including," "such as," or similar
language are intended to provide examples. They are not intended to be
exhaustive lists of all possibilities.
      (4)   Computation of time. The time in which an act is to be done shall
be computed by excluding the first day and including the last day. If the last
day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday observed by the county, that day shall be
excluded.
      (5)   References to other regulations, publications and documents.
Whenever reference is made to a resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or
document, that reference shall be construed as referring to the most recent
edition of such resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document or to
the relevant successor document, unless otherwise expressly stated.
      (6)   Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision requires the head of
a department or another officer or employee of the county to perform an act or
duty, that provision shall be construed as authorizing such officer, department
head or employee to delegate that responsibility to others over whom they have
supervisory authority.
      (7)   Technical and nontechnical terms. Words and phrases shall be
construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but
technical words and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning.
(See also division (I), "Definitions.")
      (8)   Public officials and agencies. All public officials, bodies, and
agencies to which references are made are those of Lake County, unless
otherwise expressly provided.
      (9)   Mandatory and discretionary terms. The words "shall," "will," and
"must" are mandatory, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary. The
words "may" and "should" are advisory and discretionary terms.
      (10)   Conjunctions. Unless the context clearly suggests the contrary,
conjunctions shall be interpreted as follows:
         (a)   "And" indicates that all connected items, conditions,
provisions, or events apply; and
         (b)   "Or" indicates that one or more of the connected items,
conditions, provisions, or events may apply.
      (11)   Tenses and plurals. Words used in one tense (past, present, or
future) include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates the
contrary. The singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the
singular.
      (12)   Numerical calculations. Unless otherwise specifically indicated,
for standards involving the use of numbers, all calculations shall be rounded
to the nearest hundredths.
   (G)   Conflicting provisions.
      (1)   Conflict with state or federal regulations. If the provisions of
this chapter are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government,
the more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent permitted by law.
      (2)   Conflict with other county regulations. If the provisions of this
chapter are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions
found in other adopted ordinances or regulations of the county, the more
restrictive provision will control. No text amendment, variance or condition of
approval placed on a permit or other form of county approval under this chapter
shall have the effect of nullifying, abrogating or diminishing the provisions
of any other county ordinance.
   (H)   Transitional provisions.
      (1)   Violations continue. Any violation of the previous water use
regulations of the county shall continue to be a violation under this chapter
and shall be subject to penalties and enforcement under §
52.99, unless the use, construction or other activity is consistent with the
express terms of this chapter, in which case enforcement action shall cease,

§ 53.09 FATS, OILS AND GREASE (FOG).
   (A)   Purpose. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for food service
establishments (FSEs) and non-food service establishment FOG dischargers (NFDs)
(collectively FOG producing facilities) that discharge wastewater into the
county sanitary sewer. The objectives of this section are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county's
sewerage system by FOG producing facilities that will interfere with the
operation of the water reclamation facilities;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the county's
sewerage system by FOG producing facilities that could cause sanitary sewer
overflows (SSOs); and
      (3)   To protect the environment from pollution resulting from SSOs.
      (4)   This chapter shall apply to all nonresidential users (as defined
herein as FSEs or NFDs) that discharge or may discharge excess FOG to the
county's sewerage system. This chapter authorizes inspection and regulation of
these users; authorizes monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires user record keeping;
provides for the implementation of control mechanisms if deemed necessary by
the Director; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the administration of the program
established herein (if deemed necessary by the Director).
   (B)   Administration. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Director
shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   General requirements.
      (1)   State requirements. The Illinois Pretreatment Program requirements,
found in Title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code, Parts 307 & 310, are
hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference.
      (2)   Maximum discharge limits.
 
FOG Polar (P-HEM)       200 mg/L
FOG Non-Polar (SGT-HEM) 100 mg/L
pH                      5.0 to 9.5
 
         (a)   FSEs and NFDs shall also comply with the compatible pollutant
level in §
53.05(D) and the local limits of the Lake County Pretreatment Ordinance
(Chapter 54).
         (b)   In addition, the county may establish best management practices
(BMPs) for particular groups of users. These BMPs may include, but are not
limited to, types or methods of pretreatment technology to be used, methods of
source control, minimum maintenance requirements, spill prevention practices,
or other requirements as deemed necessary by the Director.
         (c)   If a failure to maintain any grease recovery system (GRS)
results in partial or complete blockage of the building sewer or private sewer
system discharging to the county, or adversely affects the treatment or
transmission capabilities of the county sewer system, or requires excessive
maintenance, or poses a possible health hazard, the FOG producing facility
responsible for maintaining the GRS shall be subject to the remedies herein,
including cost recovery, enforcement and penalties.
      (3)   Grease removal system (GRS) requirements.
         (a)   All food service establishments (FSEs) and non-food service
establishment FOG dischargers (NFDs) shall have an adequate GRS installed and
shall exercise proper kitchen BMPs to ensure that excess concentrations of FOG
are not discharged to the water reclamation facility.
         (b)   New construction or remodeled facilities.
            1.   All new construction or remodeled food service establishments
(FSEs) and non-food service establishment FOG dischargers (NFDs) shall submit
plumbing plans for all potential grease discharging lines, all GRSs, and
connecting piping to the county for approval prior to construction. The
plumbing shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans. Failure to
submit plans or construct in accordance with approved plans is a violation of
this chapter.
            2.   All kitchen drains and any other drains that may carry grease-
laden waste shall be connected to the GRS. This includes but is not limited to:
vegetable sinks, prep sinks, hand sinks, mop basins, floor drains, bar sinks,
chemical rinse dishwashers and temperature rinse dishwashers that have been
tempered to under 150 degrees Fahrenheit. No domestic sewage may be connected
to the GRS.
            3.   All new construction or remodeled food service establishments
(FSEs) and non-food service establishment FOG dischargers (NFDs) that discharge
water or wastes to a county sanitary sewer or to a county water reclamation
facility shall be required to install, operate, clean and maintain a GRS of
appropriate size and design to achieve compliance with requirements of this
chapter. Each FOG producing facility shall have a control manhole or sampling
chamber installed and located at a point downstream of the GRS. No person shall
construct or install a GRS without the prior approval of the Director and
issuance of a permit. Such approval shall include both the approval of a plan
for the proposed GRS construction or installation and permission to conduct the
work required. Upon completion of the work and approval by the Director, a
discharge license shall be issued to the user by the Director. Each user
facility shall secure a valid discharge license issued by the Director prior to
any discharge into a county sanitary sewer.
         (c)   New construction multi-tenant buildings. All new construction
multi-tenant buildings (e.g., strip centers) shall include a separate waste
line for all leasable spaces that discharges to a common external 1,500 gallon
or larger GRS. When a space is leased, sold, or rented to a food service
establishment (FSE) or non-food service establishment FOG discharger (NFD), all
kitchen drains and any other drains that may carry grease-laden waste shall be
connected to the GRS. This includes but is not limited to: vegetable sinks,
prep sinks, hand sinks, mop basins, floor drains, bar sinks, chemical rinse
dishwashers and temperature rinse dishwashers that have been tempered to under
150 degrees Fahrenheit. No domestic sewage may be connected to the GRS. A
separate domestic sewage service is required to be connected to the public
sewer from each unit in accordance with § 53.05(C)(10) The property owner shall
be responsible for proper maintenance of this GRS in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter.

§ 53.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Fines. Any person, customer or user who violates any provision or
section of this chapter shall be subject to a fine as may be authorized under
the Lake County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance, or by statute of the
State of Illinois. Each violation of a provision or section of this chapter
shall be a separate offense and subject to a separate fine. Each day that a
violation exists or continues shall be considered a separate offense. Any fine
or fines for these separate offenses shall be assessed in accordance with
applicable ordinances or state statute.
   (B)   Administrative adjudication.
      (1)   Enforcement Officer. All sections of this chapter may be enforced
by the Director of the Lake County Public Works.
      (2)   Warning of ordinance violation. The Director shall have the
authority, but not the obligation, to issue a pre-enforcement warning of
ordinance violation when an individual has been found to be in violation of any
provision of this chapter. The warning shall, at a minimum, identify the
violation(s) for which it is being issued, shall include the address at which
the violation has occurred, shall require the violator to cease the violation
(s) or abate the violation(s) within a reasonable time for the performance of
any act it requires, and shall state that a notice of ordinance violation may
be issued if the warning is not adhered to as specified.
      (3)   Notice of ordinance violation. In the event of a violation of this
chapter, the Director shall have authority to issue a notice of ordinance
violation.
         (a)   The notice of ordinance violation shall contain the particulars
of such violation(s) and at a minimum may order the offending customer to:
explain the cause(s) of the violation(s), submit a plan or schedule for the
satisfactory correction of the violation(s) and the prevention of similar
violation(s) in the future, pay an administrative fine, or any additional
remedies deemed necessary by the county to bring the customer into compliance
within the shortest time feasible.
         (b)   Within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the
customer to the Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
customer of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of
the notice of ordinance violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the county to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement remedies, without first issuing a notice of ordinance
violation.
         (c)   If administrative adjudication is found to be the appropriate
remedy to resolve the violation, the notice must be served in accordance with
and shall contain all information specified and required in the Lake County
Administrative Adjudication Ordinance. Prior to the hearing date documented on
the notice of ordinance violation, the respondent may elect to abate or cease
the violation for which the notice of ordinance violation was issued, pay the
fine listed on the notice of ordinance violation, and not participate in the
hearing.
   (C)   Other relief. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary above,
nothing shall preclude the county from taking any other available legal action
necessary to prevent or to remedy any violation, including but not limited to
seeking injunctive relief, declaratory relief, fines, or money damages in a
court of competent jurisdiction or the disconnection of water service and/or
sewer service as specified in division (E) below.
   (D)   Service charges. In addition to division (A) above, any sanitary sewer
or manhole overflow, or sanitary sewer backup, resulting from a violation(s) of
any provision or section of this chapter, or an inadequately operating GRS, or
lack of an approved GRS, or any faulty pretreatment system shall result in the
imposition of a service charge to the responsible owner or customer. The
service charge shall include the costs of cleaning up the overflow or backup
and all costs of cleaning the blockage out of the immediately adjacent county
sewerage system. Imposition of a service charge under this section shall not
preclude other enforcement actions. In addition, the responsible customer shall
be responsible for payment of any fine levied by the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency against the county as a result of any overflow or blockage in
the county sewerage system, or national pollutant discharge elimination system
(NPDES) permit discharge violation attributable to the customer violation(s) of
any provision or section of this chapter, or an inadequately operating GRS, or
lack of an approved GRS.
   (E)   Sewer and/or water service disconnection.
      (1)   The Director shall deny or discontinue, after reasonable notice to
the occupants thereof, the sewer and/or water service to any premises for
violations of this chapter or without prior notice where, in his or her
judgment, a public health risk exists. Water shut off and/or disconnection of
the sanitary sewer of the individual user's property will result for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties and/or violation of this chapter. Prior to
disconnection the county will mail three notices to the service address on file
and the customer may contact the Director to settle the outstanding balance or
make payment arrangements to avoid service disconnection. Third and final
notice shall state "No further notices will be sent to you prior to
disconnection."
         (a)   Any violation under this chapter shall be subject to
discontinuation of water service to any premise served by a public water
supply. Water service to such premises shall not be restored until the consumer
has corrected deficiencies in conformance with this chapter and to the
satisfaction of the Director, and all fees are paid.
         (b)   Payment for service is required even if the home/building is
vacant. Payment will be suspended if the home/building is uninhabitable, if a
demolition permit has been issued or if a disconnection permit has been issued
and the sewer service has been capped and inspected.
      (2)   Sewer and/or water service to such premises shall not be restored
until the customer has corrected or eliminated such conditions or defects in
conformance with this chapter and any required fees are paid.
      (3)   Neither the county nor or its employees, agents or assigns shall be
liable to any customers of the county sewerage system for any injury, damages
or lost revenues which may result from termination of the customer's sewer and/
or water service in accordance with the terms of this chapter, whether or not
the termination of the sewer and/or water service was with or without notice.
      (4)   Where violations of this chapter result in impacts to the county's
sewerage system, the customer responsible for the impact may bear the cost to
repair and/or clean-up the sewerage system and any discharges therefrom.
      (5)   It shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter for any person
to reconnect or turn on any sewer or water service which has been disconnected
by the county without written approval of the Director. In addition, when the
county is notified that sewer or water service has been unlawfully reconnected,
the county shall have the power to immediately disconnect such service without
notice.
      (6)   All costs incurred by the county in disconnecting sewer and/or
water service may be borne by and be the responsibility of the owner of the
property served and/or the customer. All such costs shall be paid to the county
before service is restored to the property.
   (F)   Liability. Any person violating any provision of this chapter, in
addition to the fine provided shall become liable to the county for any
expense, loss or damage occasioned by the county by reason of such violations,
whether the same was caused before the notice.

   (F)   TENORM dischargers.
      (1)   If a user as defined herein is required by federal or state
drinking water regulations to remove NORM, and the process chosen by the
municipality requires periodic discharge of TENORM to the sanitary sewer, the
user must petition Lake County to accept the waste under §
54.03.
      (2)   The accumulation of TENORM in the bio-solids is a major concern.
The discharge of combined radium (Ra 226/Ra 228) to the sanitary sewer in
excess of 5.0 pCi/L shall not be acceptable and is a violation of this chapter.
      (3)   Current users shall have a mutually agreed upon action plan within
two years after the effective date of this permit. The action plan should
address the steps that will be taken to discontinue the discharge of TENORM to
the county's treatment facility.
   (G)   Notice of violation/resampling requirement. The user shall notify Lake
County within 24 hours of becoming aware of any violation of the wastewater
discharge limits noted in divisions (C), (D), or (E) above if such violation
was discovered through sampling performed by the usa er. The user shall also
conduct an additional sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
additional analysis to Lake County within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation, except if:
      (1)   Lake County performs sampling of the industrial user at least once
per month; or
      (2)   Lake County performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this initial sampling.
   (H)   Surcharge program. Lake County has determined that certain pollutants
are compatible with the Water Reclamation Facilities. Lake County reserves the
right to recover the treatment costs for those compatible pollutants that
exceed the surcharge levels listed in this division (H).
 
Compatible Pollutant              Surcharge Level
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (CBOD5) 470 mg/L
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)      1250 mg/L
Total Suspended Solids (TSS)      460 mg/L
Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N)          25 mg/L
 
The excessive strength sewage surcharges for these pollutants shall be
calculated using the following formula:
   PS= (PAVG – PSL) X Q X 8.34 X TCP
where:       
PS =   the excessive strength surcharge for the given compatible pollutant.
PAVG =   the average concentration of the compatible pollutant for the
wastewater discharge in question.
PSL =   the surcharge level concentration of the compatible pollutant as
indicated in any Lake County Ordinances or Rate Schedules in effect at the time
the surcharge is calculated.
Q =   the Industrial User wastewater flow in millions of gallons per day (MGD).
8.34 =   a factor which converts the product of concentration (mg/L) and flow
(MGD) into pounds of compatible pollutant.
TCP =   the treatment cost charge per pound of the compatible pollutant, such
charge being stipulated by any Lake County ordinances or Rate Schedules in
effect at the time the surcharge is calculated.
Lake County reserves the right to include, at its discretion, other parameters
which it determines are compatible with the wastewater treatment process. Lake
County does not consider industrial wastewater concentrations of compatible
pollutants above the surcharge levels listed to be discharge violations except
for those concentrations or slug loadings which would cause interference or
pass through at the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities.
   (I)   Right of revision. Lake County reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permit, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities.
   (J)   Inspection, sampling and records keeping.
      (1)   The county will coordinate with owners/directors or their designee
to conduct inspection of industrial facilities to ascertain whether the
purposes of this chapter are being met and if all requirements of this chapter
are being complied with pursuant to 40 CFR 403.8(f)(1)(v). Persons or occupants
of premises where wastewater is discharged, or a treatment system is located,
or where records required by this chapter are kept, shall cooperate with Lake
County or its representatives to allow access upon presentation of credentials,
at reasonable times to all parts of said premises where wastewater is
generated, treated, or discharged, or chemicals are stored, or records are
kept, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and photocopying of
records required to be kept by this chapter, and in the performance of their
duties.
      (2)   Lake County shall have the right to set up on the user's property
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, monitoring and metering
operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
suitable identification, necessary arrangements must be made with their
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel
from Lake County shall be permitted to enter immediately for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities. Unreasonable delays in allowing
access to the commercial and industrial user's premises shall be a violation of
this chapter.
      (3)   The Director or his or her representative shall not turn over or
release property such as cell phones, cameras or other electronic devices to
the user and shall be allowed access to inspect the facilities. These are
inspection tools, used to document waste streams, pretreatment units or
processes that are difficult to describe or explain. The Director or his or her
representative shall be allowed to take pictures and photographs of waste
stream(s) and pretreatment units to document processes or violation(s).
      (4)   The Director or his or her designee will work with the IU during
the inspection to ensure that confidentially is protected and the information
needed for the investigation is obtained. Confiscation of the Director's or his
or her designated representative's property, shall be classified as theft and
tampering with the property shall be considered vandalism.
      (5)   Users and Lake County shall maintain records of all information
resulting from any monitoring activities required by this chapter or, in the
case of industrial users, by 40 CFR 403.12(n). Lake County and industrial users
shall maintain such records for a minimum of three years. This period of
retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation
regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial user or operation of
Lake County's pretreatment program or when requested by the Regional
Administrator or the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA).
   (K)   Monitoring facilities. Lake County shall require monitoring facilities
to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or
internal drainage systems be provided and operated at the user's own expense.
      (1)   Whenever required by Lake County, an industrial user shall install
a large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the
building's sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Lake
County. Each manhole or sampling chamber shall be installed and maintained at
all times at the User's expense and shall have ample room to permit Lake County
to take accurate composite samples for analysis.
         (a)   The monitoring facilities shall be situated on the user's
premises. However, when such a location is impractical or causes undue hardship
to the user, Lake County may allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user.
         (b)   The monitoring facility shall be safely, easily and
independently accessible to authorized representatives of Lake County any time
or day of the week.
      (2)   Where required by Lake County, additional control manholes or
sampling chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process
within an industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of
compliance with "end of process" pretreatment standards.
   (L)   Dilution. No user shall increase the use of process water or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained
within the national categorical pretreatment standards (when effective), or in
any other pollutant-specific limitations developed by Lake County.
   (M)   Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in divisions
(A) and (E) above within the time limitations specified by the USEPA or Lake
County, whichever is more stringent. An industrial user with a pretreatment
process shall keep that process operated and maintained at the user's expense.
An industrial user may need to upgrade their facility to be in compliance with
this chapter. Detailed plans, describing such facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to Lake County for review before such facilities
are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no
way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to Lake County under the provisions
of this chapter.
   (N)   Slug/spill prevention control and countermeasure plans (SSPCC).
      (1)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause Interference with
the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities or to violate the regulatory
provisions of this chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge
into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities of prohibited materials. Such
protection shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost
and expense.
      (2)   The industrial user shall control either its production or its
discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable
regulations in the event of reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails.
      (3)   The county shall evaluate each significant industrial user (SIU) at
least once every two years, and other industrial users as necessary, to
determine whether such users need an SSPCC plan. If Lake County determines an
SSPCC plan is required, the plan shall contain at a minimum the following
elements:
         (a)   A description of discharge practices including periodic or non-
routine discharges;
         (b)   A description of stored chemicals;
         (c)   The procedures for immediately notifying Lake County Public
Works of a slug/spill in accordance with the procedures outlined in division
(O) below; and
         (d)   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
      (4)   Industrial users that store hazardous materials shall not discharge
into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities after the effective date of
this chapter unless an SSPCC plan has been approved by Lake County. Approval of
such plans shall not relieve the industrial user from complying with all other
laws and regulations governing the use, storage, and transportation of
hazardous materials.
   (O)   Notification.
      (1)   Slug/spill incidents.
         (a)   In the case of an accidental or deliberate discharge of
compatible or incompatible pollutants which may cause interference or pass
through at the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities or violate any
requirements of this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of the industrial
user to immediately telephone and notify Lake County Public Works of the
incident. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location
and time of the discharge, the type of wastewater, the concentration and volume
discharged, and any corrective actions taken by the user.
         (b)   Within five days following such an accidental or deliberate
discharge, the industrial user shall submit to Lake County a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Follow-up reports may be
required by Lake County as needed.
         (c)   Such report(s) shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities, fish kills, or any damage to person
or property; nor shall such report(s) relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or
otherwise. Failure to report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in
addition to any other remedies available to Lake County, result in the
revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
      (2)   All industrial users shall give a 30-day notice in writing to Lake
County in the event that the type, quality, or volume of wastewater, including
hazardous waste notification, from the property is expected to materially and
substantially change.
      (3)   SIUs are required to notify the Director or his or her
representative immediately of any changes at its facility creating the
potential for a slug discharge.
   (P)   Notification of hazardous waste discharge.
      (1)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify Lake County, the IEPA, and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) Region 5 authorities in writing of any discharge into
the sanitary sewer of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
listed or characteristic hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261.
         (a)   Such notification shall include:
            1.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261;
            2.   The EPA hazardous waste number; and
            3.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
         (b)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after
the discharge commences. Any notification under this division (P) need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification
of changed discharges must be submitted in accordance with division (O) above.
         (c)   In addition, if the industrial user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month into the Lake County Water
Reclamation Facilities, the notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is readily available to the
industrial user:
            1.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in
the wastes;
            2.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the waste stream discharged during the calendar month; and
            3.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
      (2)   Industrial users are exempt from the requirements of division (P)
(1) above during the calendar months in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 40 CFR
261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous waste in
a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous waste, requires a one-
time notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste, the industrial user
must notify Lake County, IEPA, and USEPA Region 5 authorities of such substance
within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this division (P), the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous waste generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (Q)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data relating to an industrial user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and
from inspections shall be available to the public without restriction unless
otherwise restricted in division (Q)(4) below, or the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Lake County, that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
All information and data, confidential or otherwise, shall be made available to
the IEPA and the USEPA for use in judicial review and enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report.
      (2)   Effluent data provided to Lake County shall not be recognized as
confidential and shall be made available to the public, IEPA, and USEPA without
restriction unless otherwise restricted in division (Q)(4) below.
      (3)   Investigatory records or compliance information gathered for
federal, state, or Lake County enforcement purposes shall be allowed to be
inspected and copied upon request of the governmental agency, to be used in
enforcement proceedings related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program.
      (4)   Information accepted by Lake County as confidential shall not be
transmitted to the general public by Lake County unless agreed to by the
industrial user.
      (5)   The Director or his or her representative shall implement measures
to prevent the negligent release of confidential information. However, Lake
County and the Director or his or her representative shall not be held legally
responsible for release of information if they acted in good faith.
   (R)   Tenant responsibility. Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the
owner or tenant is an industrial user, either or both shall be held responsible
for compliance with this chapter.
   (S)   Hauled wastewater.
      (1)   Domestic septage tank wastes may be accepted into the Lake County
Water Reclamation Facilities at a designated receiving structure within the
Water Reclamation Facility area, and at such times as are established by the
Director or his or her representative, provided such wastes do not violate
division (A) above or any other requirements established or adopted by Lake
County. Wastewater hauler discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facilities shall be issued in accordance with the Lake County Sewer Use
Ordinance (Chapter 53) or its successors, and any amendments made thereto.
      (2)   The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as "industrial septage"
requires prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with §
54.03. The Director or his representative shall have the authority to prohibit
the disposal of such wastes in accordance with §
54.03(C). Waste haulers shall be subject to all other sections of this chapter.
   (T)   Vandalism. No person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any
structure, appurtenance, or equipment, or other part of the Lake County Water
Reclamation Facilities or wastewater collection system. Any person found in
violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions (enforcement
remedies) set forth in §
54.99.
   (U)   Batch discharge. A user is allowed to discharge non-domestic
wastewater as a batch. However, that batch shall meet all local limits as
specified within the ordinance prior to discharge. Lake County Public Works
reserves the right to sample batch discharge.
(Ord. 19-1394, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 54.03 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   (A)   Prohibition of discharge without a permit.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any industrial user to discharge
wastewater into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities without a
wastewater discharge permit issued by Lake County or be in violation of the
conditions of their permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   In areas where the county provides sewer and treatment service and
communities in those areas have an existing pretreatment program, they shall
continue to issue permits to industrial users until the county has an approved
pretreatment program.
      (3)   Communities with approved pretreatment programs shall be the
control authority responsible for permitting and monitoring IUs tributary to
locally owned sewers. The community shall enforce the more restrictive limits
established in the Lake County local limits or their respective ordinances for
sewers tributary to Lake County WRFs until such time as the Lake County
pretreatment program has been approved by USEPA. Once the Lake County
pretreatment program is approved by USEPA Lake County shall become the control
authority for IUs tributary to Lake County WRFs.
   (B)   Wastewater discharge permit. All industrial users proposing to connect
to sewers that discharge into the Lake County WRFs shall obtain a wastewater
discharge permit at least 90 days prior to such connection or discharge. All
existing industrial users shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit within 30
days after notification by Lake County.
      (1)   Wastewater discharge permit application.
         (a)   Industrial users required to obtain a wastewater discharge
permit shall complete and file with Lake County, an application form,
prescribed by Lake County, and accompanied by a fee as outlined in the Rate
Ordinance. The application form shall be duly signed and certified by an
authorized representative of the industrial user.
         (b)   If additional user operation and maintenance or pretreatment
techniques or installations will be required to meet pretreatment standards,
the industrial user shall submit to Lake County the shortest schedule by which
the user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion date in this
schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the
pretreatment standards.
            1.   The schedule for compliance shall, at a minimum, contain
increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion
of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment
standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing
final plans, executing contracts for the purchase of major components,
commencing construction, completing construction, and the like).
            2.   No increment of progress referred to herein shall exceed nine
months.
            3.   No later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to Lake
County including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and if not, the date on which it expects to
comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and the steps
being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to
Lake County.
         (c)   The applicant shall provide any other information as deemed by
Lake County to be necessary to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit
application. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, Lake County
may issue a wastewater discharge permit subject to the terms and conditions
provided herein.
         (d)   All wastewater discharge permit applications and industrial user
reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain
the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
      (2)   Wastewater discharge permit conditions. Wastewater discharge permit
shall be expressly subject to all provisions of this chapter and all other
applicable regulations, user charges, and fees established by Lake County. A
wastewater discharge permit shall contain the following terms and conditions:
         (a)   A statement of duration. A wastewater discharge permit shall be
issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years. The permittee
shall file an application for renewal of its permit at least 90 days prior to
expiration of the existing permit. The user shall apply on a form provided by
Lake County for the reissuance of the permit. Upon reissuance, any applicable
provisions of the permit issued during the term of the expiring permit shall be
incorporated as conditions of the reissued permit.
         (b)   A statement of non-transferability. A wastewater discharge
permit is issued to a specific user for the process activity specified in the
permit. A permit shall not be assigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner or
new user in different premises or to a new or changed operation in the same or
different premises without the prior approval of Lake County. If the premises
are sold or otherwise transferred by the permittee to a new owner who will
maintain the operation in the same premises, then the permit held by the seller
shall be reissued by Lake County to the new owner as a temporary permit,
provided that the new owner shall immediately apply for a new permit in
accordance with this chapter and further provided that the temporary permit
shall only be effective for 90 days after the date of sale or transfer. Lake
County shall have the same remedies for violation of temporary permit as it has
for violation of another permit.
         (c)   Effluent limitations, including best management practices, on
average and maximum wastewater constituents and characteristics based upon the
more stringent of federal, state, or local discharge limits as established by
Lake County ordinances, which may include requirements for time, flow
regulation or equalization prior to discharge for each separate discharge of
the user.
         (d)   Specifications and requirements for the establishment of
compliance monitoring programs which may include sampling locations, frequency
of sampling, number and type of standard testing, submission of technical or
discharge reports, or the installation and operation of monitoring facilities
for each separate discharge of the user.
         (e)   Requirements to retain for a minimum of three years any records
of monitoring activities and results relating to wastewater discharge and for
affording Lake County access to said records in accordance with §
54.02(J).
         (f)   A statement that any user found to have violated any provision
of this chapter is subject to the enforcement remedies found at §
54.99. Such enforcement shall include, but shall not be limited to, the fines
and civil penalties found at §
54.99(G) and (J).
         (g)   A compliance schedule(s), if necessary.
         (h)   Requirements for notification of accidental or deliberate
discharge of pollutants which may cause problems in the Lake County Water
Reclamation Facilities, including, but not limited to slug loadings, bypasses,
upsets, or any violations in accordance with §
54.02(O).
         (i)   Requirements for industrial users to give a 30-day notice in
writing to Lake County in the event that the type, quality, or volume of
wastewater, including hazardous waste notification, from the property is
expected to materially and substantially change in accordance with §
54.02(O)(2).
         (j)   Requirements for the industrial users to allow the Director or
his or her representative ready access, upon presentation of credentials, at
reasonable times to all parts of its premises in which a discharge source or
treatment system is located or in which records required by this chapter are
kept for the purpose of inspection, sampling, examination, and photocopying of
said records and for the performance of any other duties in accordance with §
54.02(J).
         (k)   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by Lake County to ensure
compliance with this chapter, state, and federal pretreatment standards and
requirements.
         (l)   The terms and conditions of the wastewater discharge permit may
be subject to modification by Lake County during the term of the permit as
limitations or requirements of Lake County's pretreatment program are modified
or other just cause exists. Where the national categorical pretreatment
standards are modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR 407.7) or the combined
waste stream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)) or net/gross calculations (40 CFR
403.15) or fundamentally different factor variance for non-toxics (40 CFR
403.15) of the general pretreatment regulations, the limits as modified shall
be made a part of the permit and shall be adjusted consistent with USEPA
guidelines and regulations.
      (3)   Changes in conditions. In the event that the type, quality, or
volume of wastewater from the property or which a wastewater discharge permit
was previously granted is expected to materially and substantially change as
reasonably determined by the user or Lake County, the user shall give a written
30-day notice to Lake County and shall submit a new application to Lake County
prior to the change. Information previously submitted that has not changed does
not need to be resubmitted by the user. No user shall materially and
substantially change the type, quality, or volume of the wastewater beyond that
allowed by its permit without the prior approval of Lake County.
      (4)   Plans and specifications. Detailed plans and specifications,
prepared by an Illinois registered professional engineer, of the pretreatment
facilities proposed to be constructed shall be submitted to Lake County for
review and must be acceptable to Lake County before construction of the
facility is commenced. The review of such plans shall in no way relieve the
user from the responsibility of modifying the pretreatment facility as
necessary to comply with this chapter. The user shall submit, within a
reasonable time after the completion of the pretreatment facility, a copy of
the facility's operations and maintenance procedures to Lake County.
   (C)   Denial of wastewater discharge permit application.
      (1)   No wastewater discharge permit shall be issued by Lake County to
any person whose discharge of material to the sanitary sewers, whether shown
upon his or her application or determined after an inspection and testing
conducted by Lake County, is not in conformity with Lake County ordinances and
regulations, or whose application for a wastewater discharge permit is
incomplete or does not comply with the requirements of division (B) above. Lake
County shall state the reason(s) for denial in writing, which shall be mailed
or personally delivered to the applicant within five days after denial.
      (2)   If the application is denied, the user may submit within 30 days
after receipt of the denial a written request for a just cause process to
determine why the wastewater discharge permit should be granted pursuant to §
54.99(D).
   (D)   Reporting requirements for permittee.
      (1)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new
source, within 45 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater
into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities, any user subject to
pretreatment standards shall submit to Lake County a report indicating the
nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
process which are limited by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum
daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by
such pretreatment standards. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional user operation and maintenance, pretreatment techniques or
installations are necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user and shall be certified by an
Illinois registered professional engineer.
      (2)   Self-monitoring report.
         (a)   Any user subject to an applicable pretreatment standard, after
the compliance date of such applicable pretreatment standard (or, in the case
of a new source, after discharge of wastewater into the Lake County Water
Reclamation Facilities begins) shall submit to Lake County, on or before the
15th day of January and July each year and for the prior two calendar quarters,
a certified report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by such applicable pretreatment standards. In
addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average
and daily wastewater flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with best management practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required
by the Director or his or her representative or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
         (b)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that the sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
         (c)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this division
(D) monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Director or his or her representative, using
the procedures prescribed in §
54.02(B), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(g)(6).
         (d)   At the discretion of Lake County, and in consideration of such
factors as a local high or low flow rate, holidays, budget cycles, Lake County
may agree to alter the months during which self-monitoring reports are
submitted.
         (e)   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of
wastewater to which reference is made in this division (D) shall be determined
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(g), as amended from time to time.
      (3)   Industrial wastewater survey.
         (a)   Dischargers to any of the Lake County Public Works Wastewater
Reclamation Facilities shall periodically be requested to complete and file a
wastewater survey report. At a minimum, a description of processes and
wastewater characteristics for the facility will be required to be submitted or
updated. The survey may serve as the wastewater discharge permit application or
permit renewal documentation.
         (b)   The completed survey shall include information necessary for
Lake County to make decisions on the applicability of any regulations and
requirements of Lake County Public Works, State of Illinois and the federal
government.
         (c)   Nonresidential dischargers may be required to file the
wastewater survey report upon request by the Director.
         (d)   Prior to issuing a wastewater discharge permit, Lake County
Public Works shall classify nonresidential discharges into one of the following
categories based on the response from the survey, and/or physical site
inspection:
            1.   Industrial user (IU). A facility that has waste other than
domestic waste with flow less than 25,000 gpd average daily flow when in
operation;
            2.   Categorical industrial user (CIU). These are industries that
are defined by the federal code as being subject to national categorical
pretreatment standards. They operate a regulated process that utilizes water
that if discharged to the sanitary sewer are known to cause pass through or
interfere with the treatment process. Since this is a regulated waste, they are
required to meet the discharge limits set forth in the regulation. The intent
is to insure such discharge meets Lake County Public Works local limits as well
as the federal limits.
            3.   Significant industrial user (SIU). A significant industrial
user discharges process wastewater to the sanitary sewer where the flow (volume
of wastewater) is greater than or equal to 25,000 gpd average daily flow when
in operation, or contributes a process waste stream which makes up 5% or more
of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the receiving
treatment plant, or is designated significant by Lake County Public Works on
the basis that the industrial user has a reasonable potential for adversely
affecting the treatment operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or
requirement (in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6)).
            4.   Categorical industrial user with zero discharge (CIU-0). These
are industries that:
               a.    Operate a regulated process that generates categorical
wastewaters on site as defined by the federal code for national categorical
pretreatment standards. And has opted not to discharge the waste stream to the
sanitary sewer. The spent waste stream may be hauled off site for treatment or
the process wastewater is treated and re-used; or
               b.   Do not utilize water and it does not have the potential to
discharge regulated categorical process wastewater.
      (4)   Baseline monitoring reports. Industrial users subject to national
categorical pretreatment standards shall submit to Lake County a complete
baseline monitoring report meeting the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 403.12
(b).
         (a)   Existing industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled
to discharge into the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities shall submit a
baseline monitoring report within 180 days after the effective date of a
national categorical pretreatment standard or 180 days after the final
administrative decision made upon a categorical determination submission,
whichever is later.
         (b)   New sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent
to the promulgation of an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard
shall submit a baseline monitoring report at least 90 days prior to the
commencement of discharge.
   (E)   Bypass.
      (1)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
violate any pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if such bypass is
for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. Such bypasses are not
subject to §§
54.99(E)(2) and (E)(3).
      (2)   Notice.
         (a)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior written notice to Lake County, if possible, at least ten
days prior to the date of the bypass.
         (b)   An industrial user shall verbally notify Lake County of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. Such notice shall be given within 24 hours of the industrial user
becoming aware of such a bypass. The industrial user shall, within five days of
becoming aware of such a bypass, submit a written report to Lake County
containing: a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact times and dates; and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and the steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent a recurrence of the bypass.
      (3)   Prohibition of bypass.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and Lake County may take enforcement
against a user for a bypass unless:
            1.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage; and
            2.   There are no feasible alternatives to bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of wastewater, or maintenance
during normal periods of equipment down time. This condition is not satisfied
if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed to prevent bypass
which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventative
maintenance; and
            3.    The user submitted notices as required by §
54.99(E)(2).
               (a)    Lake County may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if Lake County determines that the bypass will
meet the three conditions required by §
54.99(E)(3)(a).
   (F)   Upsets.
      (1)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative action defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with the national categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements contained within this division (F) are met.
      (2)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative action
defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred, and the industrial user can identify the
specific cause(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
Lake County verbally, within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset, and in
writing, within five days of becoming aware of the upset:
            1.   A description of the upset and the cause(s) of noncompliance;
and
            2.   The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times;
and, if not already corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is
expected to continue; and
            3.   The steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent the recurrence of the non-compliance.
      (3)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (4)   User responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall
control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with all applicable regulations in the event of reduction, loss, or
failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (G)   Wastewater discharge permit revocation. Any industrial user who is
found to have violated any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge
permit, enforcement remedy issued under §
54.99 , or any other pretreatment standard(s) or requirement(s), is subject to
having its wastewater discharge permit revoked.
      (1)   Wastewater discharge permit shall be voidable upon nonuse,
cessation of operations, or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater
discharge permits are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge
permit.
      (2)   Following an order of revocation, the industrial user shall
immediately cease discharging into the Lake County Water Reclamation
Facilities. Failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the order
shall be evidence of continuing harm to the Lake County Water Reclamation
Facilities and provide grounds for escalated enforcement actions to be taken by
Lake County in accordance with §
54.99, or any such steps as deemed necessary by Lake County, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities or danger to any individuals or to
the environment.
      (3)   The Director or his or her representative shall reinstate the
wastewater discharge permit and/or allow the industrial user to resume its
discharge following a show cause hearing held in accordance with §
54.99.

(Ord. 19-1394, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 54.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Public notification of industrial users in significant non-compliance.
Lake County shall annually publish in the largest local newspaper within Lake
County, a list of industrial users who were in significant non-compliance of
any applicable pretreatment requirement or standard during the previous 12
months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken
against the industrial user(s) during the same 12 months.
   (B)   Notices of ordinance violation. Whenever Lake County finds that any
user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter,
wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment standard(s) or
requirement(s), the Director or his or her representative may serve upon the
user a written notice of ordinance violation.
      (1)   The notice of ordinance violation shall contain the particulars of
such violation(s) and order the offending user to at a minimum: explain the
cause(s) of the violation(s); submit a plan or schedule for the satisfactory
correction of the violation(s) and the prevention of similar violation(s) in
the future; pay an administrative fine; or any additional remedies deemed
necessary by Lake County to bring the user into compliance within the shortest
time frame feasible.
      (2)   Submission of any information, plan, or schedule for corrective
action, or fine payments in no way shall relieve the user of liability for any
violation(s) occurring before or after receipt of the notice of ordinance
violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of Lake County to
take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement remedies,
without first issuing a notice of ordinance violation.
      (3)   If administrative adjudication is found to be the appropriate
remedy to resolve the violation(s), the notice must be served in accordance
with and shall contain all information specified and required in the Lake
County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance. Prior to the hearing date
documented on the notice of ordinance violation, the respondent may elect to
abate or cease the violation for which the notice of ordinance violation was
issued, pay the fine listed on the notice of ordinance violation, and not
participate in the hearing.
   (C)   Consent orders. The Director or his or her representative is hereby
empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible for
non-compliance.
      (1)   Such orders shall include a schedule containing specific increments
of progress or remedial actions to be completed for compliance by the user
within the time period(s) also specified by the order, any stipulated fines,
and signatures of authorized Lake County and industrial user representatives.
      (2)   Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance
directives issued pursuant to division (E) below and shall be judicially
enforceable.
   (D)   Show cause orders. The Director or his or her representative may
request any user, which has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, enforcement remedy issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard(s) or requirements, to meet and show cause
why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
      (1)   A written notice shall be delivered on the user specifying the time
and place of the meeting, the proposed enforcement action(s), the reason(s) for
such action(s), and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action(s) should not be taken. The notice shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least five days prior to the meeting. Such notice may be served upon any
authorized representative of the facility.
      (2)   A show cause order shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other
action(s) or enforcement remedies against the user.
   (E)   Compliance directives. Whenever Lake County finds that any user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, enforcement remedy issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard(s) or requirement(s), the Director or his or her
representative may issue a directive to the user responsible for the discharge,
ordering the user to come into compliance within a time period stated in the
compliance directive. If the user does not come into compliance within the
stated time period, sanitary sewer service shall be discontinued unless
adequate pretreatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated.
      (1)   The compliance directive may also contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including, but not limited to: additional self-
monitoring, management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged, payment of any stipulated fines, or any other additional remedies
deemed necessary by Lake County to bring the user into compliance within the
shortest time frame feasible.
      (2)   A compliance directive shall not exceed the deadline for compliance
established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   A compliance directive shall not release the user of liability for
any violation(s), including continuing violation(s), nor shall the issuance of
a compliance directive be a prerequisite for taking any other enforcement
action or enforcement remedies against the user.
   (F)   Cease and desist orders. Whenever Lake County finds that any user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permit, enforcement remedy issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard(s) or requirement(s), or that the user's past violations
are likely to recur, the Director or his or her representative may issue an
order directing the user responsible for the discharge to cease and desist all
illegal or authorized discharges immediately.
      (1)   In emergency situations, a cease and desist order may be given by
telephone.
      (2)   In non-emergency situations, a cease and desist order may be used
to suspend or permanently revoke an industrial user's wastewater discharge
permit.
      (3)   The cease and desist order may require the user to take such
appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/
or terminating the discharge.
      (4)   The issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a
prerequisite for taking other action or enforcement remedies against the user.
   (G)   Administrative fines.
      (1)   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user that is
found to have violated any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge
permit, enforcement remedy issued hereunder, or other pretreatment standard(s)
or requirement(s), shall be fined each day the violation occurs.
      (a)   Fines shall be issued that, at a minimum, remove the economic
benefit to a user by its non-compliance, include an additional monetary amount
reflecting the seriousness or gravity of the violation(s), and ensures the user
has a strong economic incentive to fully comply in a timely manner. Lake County
shall consider any corrective actions taken by the user and the compliance
history of the user prior to the issuance of the fine.
      (b)   For the purposes of this division (G), each day in which any such
violation shall occur shall be deemed a separate violation.
         (c)   Administrative fines and penalties may be added to the user's
next scheduled wastewater billing and Lake County shall have such collection
remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall be assessed an
additional penalty of the unpaid balance and interest shall accrue thereafter
in accordance with Lake County's Retail Water/Sewer Rate Ordinance. A lien
against the individual user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties and/or violation of this chapter. In addition Lake County
Public Works may shut off water and/or disconnect the individual user's
property.
      (2)   Each user will have an opportunity to dispute the fines during the
adjudication procedure.
      (3)   Lake County may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
court reporter fees, and any other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including but not limited to sampling and monitoring expenses, and
the costs of any actual damages incurred by Lake County.
   (H)   Emergency suspensions. The Director or his or her representative may
immediately suspend a user's wastewater discharge treatment service and/or
wastewater discharge permit whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or
cause imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons,
the Lake County Water Reclamation Facilities, or the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater discharge
treatment service and/or wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or
eliminate its discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
with the cease and desist order, the Director or his or her representative
shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer service connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the Lake County
Water Reclamation Facilities, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals or the environment.
      (2)   The Director or his or her representative shall allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed following a hearing
held in accordance with division (D) above, unless the revocation proceedings
set forth in §
54.03(G) of this chapter are initiated against the user.
      (3)   Any user notified pursuant to this section shall submit to Lake
County, prior to the date of the hearing described above, a detailed written
statement describing the cause(s) of the harmful conditions and the measures
taken to prevent their future recurrence.
   (I)   Injunctive relief.
      (1)   Whenever Lake County finds that any user has violated or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit,
enforcement remedy issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard(s) or
requirement(s), or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Director or his or her representative may petition the Circuit Court of Lake
County, for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance
of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user.
      (2)   Such other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief
may also be sought by Lake County. A petition asking for injunctive relief need
not be filed as a prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
   (J)   Civil penalties. Any user that is found to have violated any provision
of this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, enforcement remedy issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard(s) or requirement(s), shall be
liable to Lake County for a civil penalty per violation per day, plus any
actual damages incurred by Lake County for as long as the non-compliance
continues. For purposes of this division (J), each day in which any such
violation shall occur shall be deemed a separate violation.
      (1)   Lake County may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs,
court reporter fees, and any other expenses associated with enforcement
activities, including but not limited to sampling and monitoring expenses, and
the cost of any actual damages incurred by Lake County.
      (2)   Lake County shall petition the Court to impose, assess, and recover
such sums. In determining the extent of the liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation(s), the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gain through the user's violation(s), corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice
requires.
   (K)   Additional remedies.
      (1)   In addition to the remedies available to Lake County set forth
elsewhere in this chapter, if Lake County is fined by the State of Illinois or
USEPA for violation of Lake County's NPDES permit or violation of water quality
standards as a result of a discharge of pollutants, then the fine, including
all of Lake County's legal, sampling, analytical testing costs and any other
related costs shall be charged to the responsible user(s). Such charge shall be
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies Lake County may have
under this chapter, statutes, regulations, at law or in equity.
      (2)   If the discharge from any user causes a deposit, obstruction, or
damage to any portion of the Lake County wastewater collection system or Water
Reclamation Facilities, the Director or his or her representative shall cause
the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be
promptly repaired. The cost for such work, including materials, labor, and
supervision, shall be borne by the person(s) causing such deposit, obstruction,
or damage.
      (3)   The remedies provided in this chapter shall not be exclusive and
Lake County may seek whatever other remedies are authorized by statute, at law
or in equity against any person violating the provisions of this chapter. Lake
County is hereby empowered to take more than one enforcement action (remedy)
against any non-compliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 90.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as and may be referred to as the "Lake County
Highway Access and Use Ordinance," hereinafter referred to as "this chapter".
This chapter provides the policy by which the County Engineer can grant
permits.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.002 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   A Technical Reference Manual serves as a companion to this chapter,
providing additional detail on technical and procedural requirements required
by the chapter. It is the intent of this manual to provide the necessary
guidance, reference materials and forms for developers, municipalities,
townships, and engineering consultants to understand the permitting process and
requirements, and to develop complete permit and engineering plan submittals.
   (B)   The Technical Reference Manual will be reviewed annually and updated
as necessary by the Lake County Division of Transportation (LCDOT).
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.003 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The proper management and operation of the county highway's
infrastructure is critical to the safety of the motoring public and directly
related to the overall economic health and quality of life in Lake County. The
economic vitality of the county is related to the availability of access to the
arterial highway system. This requires the implementation of access management
regulations that provide for a balance between the need to move traffic safely
and efficiently while still providing access to adjacent properties. The county
strives to provide transportation systems that provide for safe, efficient and
flexible movement through an integrated network of road, rail, public transit,
and non-motorized (bicycle and pedestrian) modes of travel.
   (B)   The construction, maintenance and improvement of the county highway
system represents a substantial investment of public funds. Impacts from
development on the county highway system shall be mitigated by development and
should not result in the need for the investment of additional public funds.
The use of the county highway system's rights-of-way by non-highway uses must
be properly managed to ensure that these non-highway uses do not constrain the
ability of the county to improve the county highway system in the future.
   (C)   Conflicts between vehicles using a county highway and vehicles
entering and exiting via access locations should be minimized through the
application of appropriate design standards. Therefore, the application of the
regulations and standards contained in this chapter will promote consistent
driver expectations, resulting in maximum operational efficiencies and safety,
and protect the public investment in county highways.
   (D)   The county also strives to allow for installation of utilities in a
safe and efficient manner. Prudent placement, removal, relocation,
modification, or abandonment of utilities and facilities will promote the most
effective and efficient use of the limited space available within the rights-
of-way of county highways.
   (E)   Therefore, this chapter is adopted for the following purposes:
      (1)   To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general
welfare of the county and the public using the rights-of-way.
      (2)   To promote the effective and efficient use of the rights-of-way of
county highways.
      (3)   To preserve an acceptable level of service on county highways.
      (4)   To preserve the rights-of-way of county highways for highways and
associated appurtenances.
      (5)   To minimize conflicts between vehicles using county highways and
vehicles entering and leaving via access locations on county highways.
      (6)   To establish reasonable rules, regulations, and specifications to
ensure the proper construction, installation, maintenance, removal, relocation,
and placement of utilities and facilities within the rights-of-way of county
highways in accordance with accepted engineering and design standards and
specifications, as well as the restoration of the disturbed portions of any and
all sections of the rights-of-way of county highways that are the result of the
placement, removal, relocation, modification, or abandonment of utilities and
facilities within the rights-of-way.
      (7)   To establish reasonable regulations and procedures to ensure that
any public or private utilities and facilities are either placed in easements
outside of the right-of-way or are placed within existing rights-of-way such
that future expansion of the county highway can be accomplished at no
additional cost to the county to relocate or remove such utilities or
facilities.
      (8)   To provide for the proper location and limit the number of access
locations to regulate safe and reasonable access from county highways to
abutting property and to provide sufficient spacing between access points to
minimize interference with traffic using adjacent access locations.
      (9)   To prohibit inappropriate use of a county highway as a portion of
the internal circulation system of abutting property or as parking for abutting
property.
      (10)   To provide for the establishment of sufficient pavement, right-of-
way, and easement widths.
      (11)   To establish reasonable requirements for performance and
maintenance guarantees, to ensure the proper construction of required
improvements, and to ensure that required improvements are completed in an
expeditious manner in accordance with accepted engineering and geometric
standards and specifications.

(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.021 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended, provide for the County
Board and the County Engineer to have authority over supervision of county
highways. This chapter is hereby adopted to preserve and protect the public
safety, health, and general welfare as they relate to the operation and use of
county highways, and their associated right-of-way.
   (B)   605 ILCS 5/5-413 et seq. of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended
provides for access roads and driveways for public and private use to be
allowed onto a county highway only upon the issuance of a permit by the County
Engineer in accordance with regulations adopted by the County Board. This
chapter implements that law but does not limit nor restrict the county insofar
as other sections of the Illinois Highway Code pertaining to access to and use
of county highways.
   (C)   765 ILCS 205/2 et seq. of the Illinois Compiled Statues, as amended,
requires that written approval be obtained from the appropriate local highway
authority regarding highway access prior to final approval and recording of a
plat by a municipality or county. For county highways, the authority shall be
the County Engineer.
   (D)   605 ILCS 5/8-101 et seq. of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as
amended, grants county boards the authority to designate highways under their
jurisdiction as freeways. 605 ILCS 5/8-102 et seq. gives the County Board the
sole authority to grant or deny any new points of access, or allow the
modification, change, or enlargement of any existing points of access.
   (E)   605 ILCS 5/9-115.1 of the Illinois Compiled Statues, as amended,
requires that drainage facilities for the purposes of detention or retention of
water may not be constructed within a distance of ten feet plus one and one-
half times the depth of the drainage facility adjacent to the right-of-way of
any public highway without the written permission of the highway authority
having jurisdiction over the public highway. The toe of any earthen berm may
not be constructed nearer than ten feet to the right-of-way of any public
highway without the written permission of the highway authority having
jurisdiction over the public highway.
   (F)   The Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/5-414) of the Illinois Compiled
Statutes, as amended, grants county boards the authority to adopt regulations
providing for the issuance of permits by the County Engineer for the temporary
closure to traffic of any portion of a highway under their jurisdiction for any
public purpose.
   (G)   The Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-113) of the Illinois Compiled
Statutes, as amended, sets forth the powers and authority of the appropriate
highway authority as they relate to the placement, removal, relocation,
modification, or abandonment of utilities and facilities within public highways
including their placement within the rights-of-way of county highways. For
county highways, the appropriate highway authority shall be the County
Engineer.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.022 COORDINATION COUNCIL ESTABLISHED.
   Pursuant to the authority contained in Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-
113) of the Illinois Compiled Statues, as amended, the county, acting by and
through the County Engineer, as the appropriate highway authority, hereby
establishes a Coordination Council for the purposes of implementing the
provisions of said statute and facilitating the communication and coordination
relating to the placement, removal, relocation, modification, or abandonment of
public utilities owned and maintained by a public utility company within county
highway rights-of-way.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.023 JURISDICTION.
   This chapter shall apply to all access to and use of county highway right-
of-way, whether permanent or temporary, for purposes of providing service from
and/or to a county highway to any property after the enactment of this chapter
by the County Board. This includes any land in any township or municipality
located partially or entirely within the county.
   This chapter shall not be construed in any manner or form to limit or
restrict the power or authority of the county or the County Engineer to
maintain, operate, improve, construct, reconstruct, manage, widen, expand or
perform any other work on any county highway as may be best determined, as
provided by law, including the modification, restriction, or elimination of any
access location permitted under this chapter or any access location permitted
prior to the adoption of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.024 PLAT APPROVAL.
   (A)   Pursuant to the authority contained in 765 ILCS 205/2, as referenced
in §
90.021 of this chapter, the County Engineer shall have the authority to approve
or disapprove, in writing, plats with respect to highway access to county
highways.
 
COMMENTARY:
The LCDOT's responsibility is access to and use of a county highway with
respect to the future planning, maintenance and management of the county
highway right-of-way. The responsibility for determining land-use requirements
rests solely with the governmental authority having the land-use regulatory
authority.

(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.030 VARIATIONS.
   Minimizing congestion and delay, ensuring the safety of the traveling
public, and protecting the county's ability to maintain and improve the county
highway system are among the objectives of this chapter. Under conditions of
practical difficulty and extraordinary hardships, it may be difficult to
strictly comply with the requirements of this chapter. The purpose of a
variation is to provide relief from strict compliance with the regulations and
requirements of this chapter so long as the objectives of this chapter are not
compromised.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Where the County Engineer finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with this chapter, the
County Engineer may approve variations to the requirements of this chapter so
that substantial justice may be done and the public interest subserved thereby,
provided that such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter.
      (2)   The County Engineer may require that a traffic impact study or
other information, studies, or data be submitted when reviewing a request for a
variation from the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Variation requests. A petition for any variation shall be submitted in
writing to the County Engineer by the permittee. The permittee must prove that
the variation will not be contrary to the public interest and that a practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In
particular, the permittee shall establish and substantiate that the variation
conforms to the requirements and standards as set forth in §
90.030.
   (C)   Standards for variations. No variation in the strict application of
the provisions of this chapter shall be granted unless it is found that the
following relevant requirements and conditions are satisfied. The County
Engineer may grant variations whenever it is determined that all of the
following have been met.
      (1)   The granting of the variation shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this chapter and shall not be
detrimental to the safety of the traveling public using the county highway.
      (2)   There must be proof of unique or existing special circumstances or
conditions where the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the permittee of reasonable access. Circumstances that would allow
reasonable access by a road or street other than a county highway,
circumstances where indirect or restricted access can be obtained, or
circumstances where engineering or construction solutions can be applied to
mitigate the condition shall not be considered unique or special.
      (3)   There must be proof of practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship. It is not sufficient to show that greater profit or economic gain
would result if the variation would be granted. Furthermore, the hardship or
difficulty cannot be self-created or self-imposed; nor can it be established on
this basis by the owner who purchases with or without knowledge of the
provisions of this chapter. The difficulty or hardship must result from the
strict application of this chapter and it must be suffered directly and solely
by the owner of the property in question.
      (4)   The variation is the least deviation from the provisions of this
chapter which will mitigate the hardship or practical difficulty.
   (D)   Action by the County Engineer. Upon receipt of the required variance
application form, all supporting documentation, data, studies and other
requested information and all related variance fees, the County Engineer shall
review and render a decision in writing to the owner. The County Engineer may,
in the decision for a variation, stipulate conditions or impose requirements in
granting of a variation from the provisions of this chapter. The written
decision of the County Engineer is valid for a period of one year.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.031 APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Access Control Officer. All objections to any action or decision
concerning access shall be filed in writing with the Access Control Officer.
The Access Control Officer shall consider the objections, and after a decision
has been made shall inform the permittee in writing of the action taken on said
objection.
   (B)   County Engineer. If the permittee is dissatisfied with the action or
decision of the Access Control Officer, a written objection may be filed with
the County Engineer. The County Engineer will consider the objection and
formulate a response, which will be communicated in writing. The County
Engineer may modify or overturn any previous action or decisions.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.032 FEES.

application shall be provided in the Technical Reference Manual.
   (B)   Existing agreements that have alternate permit fee schedules shall
remain in effect until and unless those agreements are expired, are terminated,
or are renegotiated, and are approved by the County Board.
   (C)   The County Engineer shall have the authority to waive any fees or
charges imposed by this chapter if said fees and charges are for a permit to
perform work within a county highway right-of-way that is needed due to a
county improvement or maintenance operation.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.033 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (A)   Whomever shall construct, or cause to be constructed, any access-
related improvements or any utility or facility within the right-of-way of any
county highway, or whoever shall repair, relocate, revise, modify, enlarge,
remove, reconstruct, or abandon any existing utility or facility within the
right-of-way in violation of the requirements of this chapter shall be subject
to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 for each access location
so constructed. Each day that the access location is in place in violation of
this chapter shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the above
penalties. A violation shall also include any access-related improvements or
any utilities or facilities within the county highways built without approval,
and a permit as required by this chapter as well as approved improvements built
with substandard designs and specifications.
   (B)   The Lake County Division of Transportation shall have the authority to
stop any and all work that it determines is proceeding in an unsafe or
substandard manner, or poses any danger to the public or the county highway. In
the event any aspect of the perimeter's construction, placement, maintenance,
repair, use or operation of the county highway at any time violates or is
forbidden by any law, statute, rule, regulation, order, or requirement of any
governmental authority, the permittee shall immediately discontinue such
operations and, at its own expense, take all necessary corrective action.
   (C)   Whenever a violation shall come to the knowledge of the County
Engineer, the County Engineer may take any action as deemed appropriate and as
set forth in the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended. The provisions of this
chapter shall not be deemed exclusive and shall not be deemed to prevent the
maintenance of any other action or proceeding in law or equity to enforce the
provisions of this chapter or to vacate and remove any improvements constructed
in violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Whenever it shall come to the knowledge of the County Recorder that
any of the provisions of this chapter have been violated, as they relate to
plats, it shall be the County Recorder's duty to notify the County Engineer and
the State's Attorney.
   (E)   The County Engineer shall have the authority to delay the issuance of
permits to an applicant due to the failure of the applicant to comply with the
provisions of other permits issued to the applicant. The County Engineer shall
also have the authority to delay the issuance of permits if the property served
by the permitted work or facility is in violation of or has not complied with
the provisions of this chapter or any other ordinance, statute, regulation or
administrative order that may apply to such property. The County Engineer shall
also have the authority to revoke any active permit issued to the applicant due
to the failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of other permits
or the failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.034 INACTIVITY.
   (A)   An application for any permit under this chapter will be considered
inactive if no response is provided by the applicant, their agent, or their
engineer within six months from the date of the last written review comments
received from LCDOT.
   (B)   If that time period has lapsed, the application will be considered
invalid and the applicant must reapply and comply with any and all new
conditions, policies, standards or ordinances that may be in effect at the time
of the re-submittal. If more than one year has passed from the date of the last
written review comments, application fees must be paid as if it was a new
submittal. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to contact the Lake
County Division of Transportation to determine the status of any permit
submittals.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.035 RESPONSIBILITY OF DAMAGE CLAIMS.
   (A)   The permittee and contractors shall indemnify and save harmless and

suits, actions, or claims of any character brought on account of property
damage, injury to or death of any person or persons, including all persons
performing any work under the permit, which may arise in connection with the
work to be performed under the permit.
   (B)   The permit is not intended by any of the provisions of any part of the
permit to make the public or any member thereof a third party beneficiary of
the permit, or to authorize anyone not a party to the permit to initiate or
maintain a suit for personal injuries or property damage pursuant to the terms
or provisions of the permit. The duties, obligations, and responsibilities of
the parties to the permit with respect to third parties shall remain as imposed
by law.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
PERMIT TYPES AND HIGHWAY CLASSIFICATION
§ 90.045 HIGHWAY ACCESS CLASSIFICATION.
   (A)   The LCDOT uses a highway access classification system to apply
appropriate access management techniques, requirements and standards to
permitting of access facilities. The specific requirements for each
classification are outlined in the Technical Reference Manual, which is
maintained by LCDOT and updated annually in accordance with provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)   County highways serve two primary functions: access and mobility. The
county highway system was developed with the primary function of providing
regional mobility. Illinois Compiled Statues 605 ILCS 5/5-102 describes county
highways to be "as nearly as possible highways connecting the principal
municipalities and trading points in each county with each other, and also with
the principal municipalities and trading points in other counties." Through
land use changes since the establishment of the county highway system, some
county highways now provide increased access to support local economic
development. As access to a roadway increases, mobility along that roadway
decreases. Due to this relationship, roadways are assigned a functional
classification that defines the design, administrative and regulatory policies
which govern that roadway. Functional classification ranges from freeways (high
mobility, low accessibility) to local streets (low mobility, high
accessibility.) The appropriate degree of access control varies according to
the function the roadway provides.
 
COMMENTARY:
Access management is the coordinated planning, regulation, and design of access
between roadways and land development. Studies have shown that an effective
access management program can reduce crashes by as much as 50%, increase
roadway capacity by 23% to 45%, and reduce travel time and delay as much as 40%
to 60% (source: Access Management Manual, Transportation Research Board, 2014.)
 
   (C)   Access classification definitions. The county highway system is
comprised of roadways with varying functional classifications. For purposes of
determining the requirements and procedures for permitting of access
facilities, the following access classifications are established:
      DESIGNATED FREEWAY. Those roadways that, in accordance with 605 ILCS 5/8-
101, as amended, have been designated by the County Board as freeways and as
such are intended to provide the highest level of mobility within the county
highway system. They are intended to provide very low accessibility. Currently
two county highways are designated freeways in Lake County:
         (a)   Washington Street (County Highway 45) from US 41 to IL 21.
         (b)   Peterson Road (County Highway 20) from US 45 to IL 60.
      HIGH MOBILITY HIGHWAY. Those county highways of regional importance that,
by their length and connectivity with other county and/or state highways or
large centers of activity, provide for a high degree of mobility and supplement
the mobility of state highways and freeways.
      LOW MOBILITY HIGHWAY. Those County Highways of local importance that
provide connectivity between arterials and local roads, or by their current
physical characteristics provides a low level of mobility.
      MEDIUM MOBILITY HIGHWAY. Those county highways of regional or local
importance that provide connectivity between the municipal street system and
other county or state highways or serve as a connection between county highways
or centers of activity.
   (D)   Access Classification Map.
      (1)   Adoption of map. To implement the intent of this chapter, the
county highway system is hereby divided into highway access classifications as
depicted on the Access Classification Map which is contained within the
Technical Reference Manual and is hereby adopted by reference.
      (2)   Map amendments. As county highways are constructed, improved,
reconstructed, or otherwise altered, there may be a need to change the
classification of a county highway for access management purposes. The Access
Classification Map may be amended from time to time by update to the Technical
Reference Manual. The LCDOT shall be responsible for maintaining and updating
the Access Classification Map.

§ 90.046 ACCESS PERMIT TYPES.
   Access to a county highway, whether temporary or permanent, shall be granted
via one of five types of access permit classifications. Access permit
classifications are a function of the traffic volumes that the access will
generate and the usage of the access. The five classifications of permits
followed by their definitions are:
   (A)   Minimum access.
   (B)   Minor access.
   (C)   Major access.
   (D)   Designated freeway access.
   (E)   Temporary access.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.047 MINIMUM ACCESS.
   (A)   A minimum use access is one which serves a single family residence or
agricultural field abutting a county highway, has an anticipated daily two-way
traffic volume (total number of entrance and exit trips by vehicles using the
access) of no more than 20 trips and has no regular use by vehicles or vehicle
combinations of three axles or more (personal recreational vehicles excluded).
   (B)   A gated access for the sole use of emergency response providers may be
considered a Minimum Access if the access will be in place longer than 12
months.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.048 MINOR ACCESS.
   (A)   A minor access is one which serves property abutting a county highway,
has an anticipated normal daily two-way traffic volume (total number of
entrance and exit trips by vehicles using the access) of no more than 50 trips,
as estimated utilizing the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers Trip Generation Manual, and has no regular use by vehicles or vehicle
combinations of three axles or more (personal recreational vehicles excluded).
   (B)   Examples of land-uses served by a minor access can include, but is not
limited to, a small residential community (e.g., two to four houses), an
apartment complex with eight or fewer units, or an office building with less
than 3,000 gross square feet.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.049 MAJOR ACCESS.
   (A)   A major access is one which serves property abutting a county highway
and has an anticipated daily two-way traffic volume (total number of entrance
and exit trips by vehicles using the access) of more than 50 trips, or has
regular use by vehicles or vehicle combinations of three axles or more
(personal recreational vehicles excluded).
   (B)   Examples of land-uses served by a major access can include, but is not
limited to, regional shopping centers, multiple-unit, single-family, multi-
family residential developments, office, industrial complexes, public,
religious, education, or recreation uses.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.050 DESIGNATED FREEWAY ACCESS.
   (A)   605 ILCS 5/8-101 et seq. Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended,
grants the authority to a County Board to designate particular highways on the
county highway system as freeways for the purpose of promoting the safety and
convenience of highway traffic by regulating access to the freeway. This
designation may also apply to approach roads which intersect or approach the
freeway. A permit for an access to such freeways shall be termed a "designated
freeway access permit." The County Board has the sole authority to grant or
deny new points of access or changes, modifications, and/or revisions to
existing points of access in accordance with 605 ILCS 5/8-102 et seq. as
amended.
   (B)   As of January 2018, there are two such designated freeways on the
county highway system. They are: (1) Washington Street (County Highway 45) from
U.S. 41 to IL 21, and (2) Peterson Road (County Highway 20) from U.S. 45 to IL
60.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.051 TEMPORARY ACCESS.
   (A)   A temporary access is one which serves property abutting a county
highway and is used for a specified purpose for less than 12 months and then is
removed in its entirety or is replaced with a permanent access. A temporary
access may be either a minor access or a major access depending on the daily
traffic volumes.
   (B)   Examples of temporary access can include, but are not limited to,
access for special events, construction access to backyards, access for a
construction entrance to begin initial site preparation work or construction of
on-site utilities prior to approval of a permanent access permit.
   (C)   The Access Control Officer may extend a temporary access permit in
special cases where temporary access is required for more than 12 months.

   Use of the county highway right-of-way for a non-highway function such as
special events, utilities or facilities, whether temporary or permanent, shall
be granted via one of four types of use permits. A permit is required for any
work performed in the county highway right-of-way, even if a temporary or full
closure of the roadway is not required. The four types of use permits are:
   (A)   Special event.
   (B)   Utility.
   (C)   Facility.
   (D)   Single service connection.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)

ACCESS REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES
§ 90.064 INTRODUCTION.
   Any owner of property abutting a county highway has the right of reasonable
access. Access which meets the requirements in this chapter shall be approved
through granting an access permit. To assist a property owner, developer, their
engineer, contractor, public agencies or any other applicant in the
administrative, procedural and engineering requirements of this chapter, refer
to the Technical Reference Manual.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.065 ACCESS PERMITS.
   (A)   n access permit shall be required for the construction of any new
access or the modification of any existing access within the right-of-way of a
county highway, when the work is to be done by any person or public agency
other than Lake County. An access permit shall not be required for a public
agency when a joint agreement covers the work involved therein or at such times
as the County Engineer is exercising statutory supervisory authority.
   (B)   Requirements for access to a county highway are based on two factors:
      (1)   The type of access (minimum, minor, major, designated freeway,
temporary).
      (2)   The access classification of the county highway from which the
access is being permitted.
   (C)   The owner must specify the type of access being requested. If the
access type is unknown or ambiguous, the owner shall consult the Access Control
Officer. The County Engineer has the responsibility and final authority for
determining the access type.
   (D)   The access permit is valid for as long as the use is consistent with
the approved access type, unless otherwise specified on the permit. The Access
Control Officer may, upon written request, extend the term of an access permit
for such a period as the Access Control Officer may determine.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.066 CHANGE IN LAND USE OR CHANGE IN LAND-USE DENSITY.
   (A)   A change in use notification shall be required when a change in the
use of the access location or a change in the land-use or land-use density
occurs and the continued use of an existing access location is proposed.
Changes in land-use or land-use density may result in a significant change in
the number of or type of vehicles using an access location. Therefore, a new
access permit as well as modifications, improvements, additional right-of-way
dedications or revisions may be required to the existing access location and/or
the county highway to accommodate the change in traffic.
   (B)   Changes in land-use or land-use density are situations that may result
in a change in the number or type of vehicles using an existing access.
Modifications, improvements, or revisions may be required to the access point
and/or the county highway to accommodate the change.
 
COMMENTARY:
Examples of changes in land-use may be the conversion of an office space to a
medical office space, or an office space to a commercial retail space. Examples
of changes in land-use density may be the redevelopment of an existing gas
station to include a convenience store and car wash, installation of additional
parking spaces, or the expansion of a building on a property with an existing
access.
 
   (C)   If a change in land-use or land-use density occurs and an existing
access point is proposed to be used, the owner shall submit a change in land-
use notification form to the LCDOT prior to construction of proposed changes.
The notification and supporting information shall be reviewed to identify if
the existing access facility is suitable for the proposed land-use or land-use
density, under the provisions of this chapter. If determined suitable, the
owner will be notified to continue use of the existing access point. If the
existing access facility is not suitable for the proposed land-use or land-use
density, as determined by the Access Control Officer and in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and the design standards in the Technical Reference
Manual, the owner shall submit a new application for a new access permit and
make all modifications, improvements or revisions to the existing access point
and/or the county highway to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   If a property is being re-subdivided or redeveloped, the existing
access point(s) may require relocation, reconstruction, or the number of access
points reduced to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.067 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   The following requirements shall apply to all types of access permits.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.068 JOINT HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS.
   In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to the motoring public to
construct access improvements as part of a larger overall improvement or in
conjunction with programmed county highway improvements. In order to minimize
disruptions to the public, the County Engineer may require access related
improvements to proceed in a coordinated and comprehensive manner.
   (A)   Programmed improvements.
      (1)   In certain circumstances, the LCDOT may have a highway improvement
programmed for the section of county highway for which an owner is applying for
access and the owner, in accordance with the provisions set forth in this
chapter, is required to construct highway improvements to accommodate the
proposed access. The County Engineer may recommend that both improvements
proceed simultaneously and as a coordinated joint improvement.
      (2)   For joint improvement projects, the County Engineer shall have the
option to require a formal joint agreement to be approved by the County Board.
The joint agreement shall be prepared by the LCDOT and shall specifically
provide for the responsibilities and obligations of the county and the owner as
related to the joint improvement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
relieve the owner of any financial responsibilities related to an access
improvement.
      (3)   If the owner or the County Engineer determines a joint agreement
for a joint improvement is not appropriate, the County Engineer shall specify
the conditions to be made a part of the access permit so that construction of
the access-related improvement shall not interfere with the proposed county
highway improvement project.
   (B)   Ongoing improvements.
      (1)   In certain circumstances, the LCDOT may have a highway improvement
under construction for the section of county highway for which an owner, in
accordance with the provisions set forth in this chapter, is required to
construct highway improvements to accommodate a proposed access. The County
Engineer may recommend that the highway improvements for the access location be
incorporated into the ongoing county highway improvement project by means of a
formal joint agreement or by a donation of money to be made a part of the
access permit. If a formal joint agreement is recommended, the parties shall
proceed as in subdivision (A) above.
      (2)   If a donation of money is recommended by the County Engineer, the
owner shall have the option to agree in writing to an amount determined by the
LCDOT. This amount shall be sufficient to cover the cost of the required access
improvement, including engineering costs and construction supervision, as part
of the ongoing county highway improvement project. The donation shall be
subject to acceptance by the Public Works, Planning and Transportation
Committee, in accordance with 605 ILCS 5/5-101.7 et seq., as amended.
      (3)   If the Public Works, Planning and Transportation Committee, elects
not to proceed with a donation, the County Engineer shall specify the
conditions to be made a part of the access permit so that construction of the
access improvement by the owner required for the access shall not interfere
with the ongoing county highway improvement project.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the owner of
any financial responsibilities as related to an access or access improvements.
   (C)   Donations. The Public Works, Planning and Transportation Committee, in
accordance with, 605 ILCS 5/5-101.7 et seq., as amended, shall have the
authority to accept money or right-of-way or additional detention or
compensatory floodplain storage donated from any source and to use the same for
county highway purposes to mitigate the impacts to the county highway system
from the proposed development.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.069 COORDINATION OF DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   If property abutting a county highway is being developed and access is
requested to the county highway, it shall be the responsibility of the owner to
effect any coordination necessary to comply with the requirements and
provisions of this chapter and the requirements of the governmental authority
having land-use regulatory authority.
   (B)   If two or more owners of property abutting a county highway are being
developed during the same time period, the Access Control Officer may require
each owner to effect any coordination necessary to comply with the requirements
and provisions of this chapter. This may include constructing their respective
highway access improvements as a joint and coordinated effort as one
construction project.
   (C)   The issuance of an access permit by the LCDOT shall not be construed
to relieve an owner of any responsibility to secure any other permits or comply
with any requirements of any other governmental authority having any
jurisdictional responsibilities as it relates to a development. The owner shall
also be responsible for securing any permits or complying with any other
requirements of any governmental authority as they may relate to the
construction of an access or highway improvement.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.070 COSTS OF ACCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO COUNTY HIGHWAYS.
   (A)   The permittee shall be solely responsible for paying all costs
associated with the design and construction of an access and all costs
associated with the design and construction of any improvements to a county
highway as required by this subchapter to accommodate the access and the
traffic using the access. Costs to the owner shall include but are not limited
to the following:
      (1)   Preparation of any plans, studies, information, or data required by
the LCDOT to review an access request and any revisions thereto.
      (2)   Collection of traffic counts and classification counts.
      (3)   Preparation of a traffic impact study and any revisions thereto.
      (4)   Preparation of preliminary plans and any revisions thereto.

devices.
      (11)   Relocation of utilities and facilities out from underneath the
existing or proposed pavement.
      (12)   Relocation of above ground utilities and facilities including
utility poles to the proposed right-of-way line and outside of the clear zone.
      (13)   Removal of objects in the right-of-way (see §
90.081).
      (14)   All easements and right-of-way necessary to construct improvements
required by this chapter and the preparation of any plats and other legal
documents.
      (15)   Obtaining and posting performance guarantees, certificates of
insurance, and maintenance guarantees.
      (16)   Fees and other charges as required by this chapter.
      (17)   All other costs associated with access and improvements to a
county highway as required in this chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.071 COORDINATION WITH OTHER LCDOT PERMITS.
   After the engineering plans, specifications, estimate of cost, payment of
fees, performance guarantee, and certificate of insurance are received and
approved by the LCDOT, the plat of subdivision will be signed by the County
Engineer. Also at this time any utility/facility permits that have been applied
for can be issued with the issuance of the access permit. Construction may then
commence in accordance with the rules, regulations, and specifications of this
chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.072 ACCESS POLICY.
   It is Lake County policy that any owner of property abutting a county
highway has the right of reasonable access. Indirect access via other existing
or proposed streets or easements or restricted access is considered reasonable
access to a county highway.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.073 ACCESS CRITERIA.
   (A)   This section describes criteria applicable to all types of access. The
criteria presented include the maximum number of access points and their
permissible location with respect to adjacent access points and intersecting
streets.
 
COMMENTARY:
The number of access points along a county highway should be limited and spaced
far enough apart so that conflicting movements are minimized and safe operation
is promoted.
 
   (B)   Maximum number of access points.
      (1)   Each development or property regardless of the number of parcels
shall be limited to one access point, except as provided for otherwise in this
chapter.
      (2)   One additional access point may be granted if it can be
demonstrated that the level of service at the approved access point would be
substantially improved by the addition of one access point. In this instance,
the level of service at the approved access point must be improved by a minimum
of one level of service. This level of service improvement must provide a
noticeable improvement, i.e., a level of service improvement from B to A would
not warrant an additional access.
      (3)   The Access Control Officer may permit one additional restricted
access, permitting right-turns in and right-turns out only, provided that the
owner clearly demonstrates a substantial need and complies with all the
applicable provisions of this chapter. This option will only be considered
where the enforcement of this restricted movement will be possible.
      (4)   Upon review and approval by the Access Control Officer, a one-way
pair of access points may be permitted in place of a single major access point.
The location, driveway separation, engineering design, and geometrics of the
access-related improvements shall be determined by the LCDOT on a site-specific
basis.
 
COMMENTARY:
Where additional access points are requested, first consideration shall be
given to supplemental access points, which restrict turning movements. Shared
access points or indirect access from adjacent public streets is encouraged.
Access classification of the roadway will be considered by the Access Control
Officer in evaluation of requests for additional access points.
 
   (C)   Alignment with existing access locations or roads. Where an existing
access location or road is on the opposite side of the county highway from an
abutting property for which access is being requested, the proposed access
shall be aligned with the existing access location or road whenever possible.
Given site specific characteristics or operational considerations on the county
highway, the Access Control Officer may waive this requirement under the
following conditions:
      (1)   The abutting property for which access is being requested has
insufficient frontage to allow for the proper alignment with the existing
access location or road.
      (2)   The proposed point of access would not comply with other provisions
and requirements set forth in this chapter.
      (3)   The alignment of the proposed access point with an existing access
location or road would be detrimental to traffic flow, result in undue delay,
impede traffic operations, or impair traffic safety on the county highway.
      (4)   In the event that a proposed access point is not aligned as
provided for in this section, the spacing of access points with existing
adjacent access points and roads shall comply with the provisions in §§
90.073(D) and
90.073(E).
   (D)   Spacing of adjacent access points.
      (1)   To function effectively, adjacent access points shall be spaced to
ensure safe and efficient traffic movements and operations.
      (2)   The minimum distance between adjacent access points shall be
determined by the distance required to provide full left-turn tapers and
storage bays along the county highway for inbound turning movements to each
access location regardless of the present need for said tapers and storage
bays. The geometric standard can be found in the LCDOT Standard Details.
      (3)    If a property has inadequate frontage to meet this spacing
requirement, the Access Control Officer shall determine the location of the
access point using the standards and provisions established by the chapter. The
Access Control Officer may require that the access be shared, that indirect
access be used, or that the access restrict turning movements.
   (E)   Distance from intersecting streets.
      (1)   To enhance traffic safety and operation on county highways, access
points shall be located a sufficient distance from intersecting streets.
      (2)   The minimum distance between an access point and an intersecting
street shall be determined by the distance required to provide full left-turn
tapers and storage bays along the highway for both the access point and the
intersecting street, regardless of the present need for said tapers and storage
bays. The geometric standard can be found in the LCDOT Standard Details.
      (3)   If a property has inadequate frontage to meet this minimum distance
requirement, the Access Control Officer shall determine the location of the
access point using the standards and provisions established by this chapter.
The Access Control Officer may require that the access be shared, that indirect
access be used, or that the access restrict turning movements.
   (F)   Proximity to adjacent intersections and access points.
      (1)   If construction of an access requires the widening of and
improvements to the abutting county highway, and an existing intersection or
access falls within the limits of construction, then such widening or
improvements shall extend through and beyond the intersection or access before
tapering down to the existing pavement width. Exclusive left-turn lanes shall
be provided at the existing intersection or access.
      (2)   The Access Control Officer shall determine the limits of the
construction of widening and improvement to a county highway.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.074 RESTRICTED TURNING MOVEMENTS.
   (A)   Turning movements may be restricted under conditions where capacity,
delay, operational, or safety conditions make specific turns in or turns out
detrimental to the public interest. These conditions will be identified on a
site-specific basis. Refer to the Technical Reference Manual for additional
guidance on site-specific conditions.
   (B)   Turning movement restrictions shall be enforced with barrier median
channelization or driveway channelization. The Access Control Officer shall
determine the type of channelization based on site conditions and the access
classification. Design standards and details are provided in the Technical
Reference Manual.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.075 INDIRECT ACCESS.
   (A)   Access to other streets. Access to a county highway may be prohibited
when a property abutting a county highway has frontage on one or more other
streets and reasonable access can be provided from said streets. The Access
Control Officer shall determine, on a site-specific basis whether access will
be permitted to the county highway.
   (B)   Access to property for residential or non-residential subdivisions.
When property abutting a county highway is to be subdivided or developed,
direct access to a county highway shall not be used in lieu of an adequate
internal traffic circulation system. Indirect access to individual lots shall
be required from an internal traffic circulation system which itself provides
access to the county highway or other street. The Access Control Officer shall
determine, on a site-specific basis, which lots abutting the county highway may
have direct access and which lots shall have indirect access.
 
COMMENTARY:
As an area develops and subdivisions are platted contiguous to one another, the
internal street system should interconnect. Such interconnection permits local
movement between subdivisions without forcing trips between subdivisions to use
major roads such as county highways as part of an internal circulation system.
For non-residential developments, outlots and service to individual businesses
should be provided via cross easements, frontage roads or other internal
circulation system. The purpose of major roads such as county highways is to
carry traffic to and from such sites, not to augment or be a part of an
internal circulation system.
 
   (C)   Wording on the plat of subdivision.
      (1)   When indirect access is required and there is a plat of
subdivision, the following note shall be placed on the plat of subdivision:
      (2)   Direct access to [county highway name] Road, County Highway [county
highway number], from lots [lot numbers] is prohibited.
      (3)   This note shall be placed on all plats that have additional lots or
outlots along the county highway frontage that will not take direct access to
the county highway.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.076 TURNAROUNDS.
   No access shall be permitted if such access would require backing or turning
maneuvers onto a county highway. Provisions for turnarounds shall be made
outside the county highway right-of-way unless otherwise approved by the Access
Control Officer.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.077 PARKING.
   (A)    No access shall be permitted if such access would result in parking
on a county highway or within the right-of-way of a county highway, unless
otherwise approved by the Access Control Officer. Provisions for parking shall
be made outside of the right-of-way of a county highway.
   (B)   The Access Control Officer may approve provisions for parking within
the right-of-way of a county highway if an agreement for such parking and
associated maintenance responsibilities is in place with the local
municipality.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.078 ACCESS TO CORNER LOTS.
   The following standards shall govern access to corner lots:
   (A)   (1)   For access to an abutting property located at the intersection
of two county highways, one access point shall be permitted on the county
highway having the lower volume of traffic. The Access Control Officer shall
determine which highway has the lower volume of traffic. The requirements for
the access point shall comply with the provisions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   The Access Control Officer, on a case-by-case basis, may allow an
access point on the county highway with the higher volume of traffic provided
the left turns into the site are not counter to and are in the same direction
as the left turn movements at the intersection with the cross street.
   (B)   (1)   For corner lots at an intersection where only one of the
abutting roads is a county highway, access shall be provided from the road
having the lower volume of traffic. The Access Control Officer shall determine
which road has the lower volume of traffic. If the Access Control Officer
determines that the county highway has the lower volume of traffic, one access
shall be permitted, and the requirements for the access point shall comply with
the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   If access has previously been granted by another highway authority
having jurisdiction over the road having a higher volume of traffic than the
county highway, then access to the county highway shall not be permitted.
   (C)   If access is being requested to both roads and one or both roads is a
county highway, the owner may apply for a variation from this section. In
addition to the provisions set forth in §
90.030 of this chapter, a traffic impact study shall be required.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.079 ACCESS TO SUBDIVIDED OR PREVIOUSLY PLATTED PARCELS.
   Access to land subdivided prior to the adopted date of this chapter, April
12, 1988, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the extent
possible. Owners of such property for which access is being requested and for
which compliance with this chapter cannot be attained may request the Access
Control Officer to grant access. Such access granted by the Access Control
Officer shall be the least deviation from the rules, regulations, and
specifications of this chapter.
 
COMMENTARY:
Many older existing subdivisions were platted with small lots fronting on
county highways. In these instances shared access or indirect access can be
used to reduce the number of access points on a county highway.
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.080 SHARED ACCESS.
   Certain geometric, land-use, and site conditions may require shared access
among two or more developments or properties. This would occur when frontages
are limited and each development or property is unable to meet the requirements
of this chapter. In these instances, shared access shall be provided to
adjacent developments or properties. The Access Control Officer shall determine
on a site-specific basis when shared access shall be required.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.081 REQUIRED HIGHWAY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   In order to maintain safe and efficient traffic operations at the
access intersection and to ensure that the impact of a development accessing a
county highway does not result in a degradation of traffic operations,
improvements to the county highway system may be required with a major access
permit. These improvements may include dedication of additional right-of-way to
accommodate the widening required to maintain the existing level of service.
 
COMMENTARY:
Increases in traffic from development result in two types of impacts to the
county highway system:
 
      (1)   Impacts that occur at the access point(s) and adjacent
intersections that result in an increase in delays at those specific locations
and are directly attributable to a specific development.
      (2)   Cumulative impacts to the overall roadway network that result from
the incremental increases in traffic from developments.
   (B)   Limits of required improvements for any major access permit shall be
determined by the Access Control Officer, in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and design guidance provided in the Technical Reference Manual,
Chapter 4.
   (C)   Right-of-way requirements.
      (1)   Right-of-way widths.
         (a)   The right-of-way widths for county highways shall be a total of
100 to 140 feet, 50 to 70 feet half right-of-way width, as designated by the
County Engineer. Required right-of-way shall be determined for each permit
request based on the access classification of the county highway to which
access is being requested, existing right-of-way width, surrounding land use,
local development plans and long range transportation plans. In general,
required right-of-way width increases as the level of mobility of the county
highway increases. Required minimum right-of-way width by access classification
is included in the Technical Reference Manual.
         (b)   If the property abutting a county highway is to be subdivided or
a major access is being requested, the owner shall dedicate, at no cost to the
county, sufficient land to satisfy this right-of-way requirement.
         (c)   If additional right-of-way is needed in order to construct the
required highway improvements or is needed to accommodate a future improvement
to a county highway due to the particular circumstances of the nature of the
major access, the additional right-of-way shall be dedicated by the owner at no
cost to the county. This may include additional right-of-way required to obtain
the required sight distance at the proposed access location. If the additional
right-of-way needed is from property not controlled by the owner, the owner
shall obtain the additional right-of-way in the name of the county at no cost
to the county.
      (2)   Right-of-way widths to accommodate future county bike paths. At
certain major intersections and along county highways where future county bike
paths will be constructed as identified by the County Engineer, an additional
ten to 20 feet of right-of-way width may be required. If the abutting property
is being subdivided or a major access is being requested, the owner shall
dedicate, at no cost to the county, sufficient land to satisfy the right-of-way
requirement as designated by the County Engineer to accommodate the future
county bike path.
      (3)   Wording on plat. The following wording shall be used to dedicate
right-of-way, on a plat of subdivision or plat of dedication: HEREBY DEDICATED
FOR PUBLIC ROAD PURPOSES.
      (4)   Restoration of right-of-way. Upon completion of any construction
work within the right-of-way, the right-of-way shall be restored in accordance
with the permitted plans acceptable to the LCDOT.
      (5)   Objects in the right-of-way. In general, no new objects, trees,
plantings, bushes, landscaping, fences, signs, rocks, debris, berms, detention
or retention facilities, or any such materials shall be permitted within the
right-of-way. Trees may be allowed to be planted within the right-of-way, if a
municipality will accept maintenance of these trees via the municipal
acceptance form or via an agreement. In those instances where additional right-
of-way is being dedicated as required by this chapter, brush, fences, signs,
rocks, landscaping, objects, berms, detention facilities, wetlands,
floodplains, and other such obstacles shall be removed or relocated beyond the
new right-of-way line and clear zone. All affected existing utility poles shall
be relocated to the new right-of-way line along the entire frontage of the
development.
      (6)   Right-of-way encumbrances. All right-of-way to be dedicated shall
be free and clear of any existing encumbrances, which would render the right-
of-way in any manner or form unusable for road purposes or would in any manner
or form, result in any extraordinary costs to the county at such time as said
right-of-way is to be used for road purposes. This would include the mitigation
and/or fee for future mitigation of any wetlands within the proposed right-of-
way.
      (7)   Right-of-way monumentation. All new right-of-way boundary corners,
points of curvature and points of tangency shall be monumented with iron pipes
or rods that are a minimum of one-half inch diameter by 24 inches long or with
other acceptable types of monuments that are in compliance with the Illinois
Professional Land Surveyor Act of 1989 Section 1270.56, Minimum Standards of
Practice, paragraph 5. The type of monuments found or set shall be noted on the
plat.
 
COMMENTARY:
The additional right-of-way required in this section is needed to accommodate
future highway improvements that are needed because of the cumulative traffic
generation of developments and to accommodate access related improvements. The
right-of-way widths are also needed to accommodate roadway drainage, snow
storage, utilities and facilities, and to provide for traffic and pedestrian
safety.
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.082 ACCESS PERMIT PROCESS.
   (A)   Review and issuance of each type of access permit shall be governed by
the individual processes outlined in the Technical Reference Manual.
   (B)   The general administrative process applicable to all permits includes:
      (1)   Permit review is initiated with an initial submittal package which
shall include at a minimum a cover letter, application form and site plan
location. A pre-application meeting shall be required for a major access permit
or designated freeway permit. See the Technical Reference Manual for additional
guidance on initial submittal requirements.
      (2)   The owner shall sign and submit the permit application and
application fee. For all access permits, the owner shall be considered the
permittee for all provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   Submittals received by the LCDOT will be reviewed within 15 working
days or as deemed a reasonable time period given manpower, workload, and
budgeting constraints. All submittals that require review by LCDOT departments
outside of the Permitting Department may require more than 15 working days for
the review to be completed by all parties.
      (4)   The Access Control Officer may require engineering studies, plans,
and other information in order to review and evaluate the owner's application.
All engineering documents shall be signed and sealed by a licensed professional
engineer in the State of Illinois. Multiple reviews may be necessary prior to
approval of the engineering plans. The LCDOT shall include guidance on
engineering plan and study requirements in the Technical Reference Manual.
      (5)   Upon approval of the initial submittal and engineering documents,
receipt of required fees, guarantees, and proof of insurance as required, a
permit will be issued.
      (6)   Construction must begin within the time frame specified in the
Technical Reference Manual, unless otherwise specified on the permit.
      (7)   When construction work is complete, per the approved plans, the
LCDOT shall be notified in writing to perform a final inspection.
      (8)   When construction work, inspections and punch list items are
completed, the access permit work will be accepted by the LCDOT.
      (9)   Upon acceptance of the access permit work, the permittee shall
provide as-built plans, maintenance guarantee (if required), and pay
outstanding invoices. The performance guarantee will then be released.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.083 RESIDENT ENGINEER LETTER.
   The permittee shall provide a licensed professional engineer to act as
resident engineer, as required by permit type. He or she shall be responsible
for inspections on behalf of the permittee and will be responsible for ensuring
that the permitted work is constructed in compliance with the approved
engineering plans and specifications. While the LCDOT may conduct periodic
inspections, it is not their responsibility to provide project management or
day-to-day oversight of the construction. The resident engineer information
shall be submitted to the LCDOT on the resident engineer's company letterhead
and include the engineer's name, address, telephone number, and professional
engineer's license number for the licensed professional engineer who will act
as resident engineer. A sample letter for use by resident engineers can be
found in the Technical Reference Manual.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
UTILITY AND FACILITY PERMIT POLICIES
§ 90.100 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   In order to provide for the safe placement of utilities and facilities
within the rights-of-ways of county highways, to safeguard the motoring public,
to promote the orderly and efficient use of public rights-of-way, and to ensure
that said placement of utilities and facilities does not inhibit the county's
ability to maintain, operate, and improve the county highway system, it is
hereby declared to be the policy of the county to regulate the placement,
removal, relocation, modification, or abandonment of utilities and facilities
within the rights-of-way of county highways through the rules, requirements,
and regulations established by this chapter and the specifications,
requirements and conditions contained in the Technical Reference Manual.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.101 UTILITY OR FACILITY PERMIT.
   (A)   A permit shall be required for the replacement, relocation, repair,
modification or removal of any existing utility or facility and any manner or
form of work relating to the construction or placement of a new utility or
facility within the right-of-way of any county highway. For all provisions of
this chapter, a single service connection permit shall be considered a utility
or facility permit. All work associated with a utility or facility to be placed
or already existing within the right-of-way of a county highway shall be
performed at no cost to the county.
   (B)   Any public utility company, municipal corporation, or other public or
non-public corporation, association or person may request permission to locate,
place or construct upon, under, or along any highway, utilities or facilities
provided that the entity receive written consent from the LCDOT in accordance
with this chapter. The LCDOT has the right to deny, on a non-discrimination
basis, any application for the placement of utilities or facilities for any
reasonable cause or for safety concerns when such placement would, in the
opinion of the LCDOT, be detrimental to current or future needs of the county
highway system.
   (C)   A permit for work relating to a utility or facility shall be valid for
a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of issuance and all rights
arising from or created by such issued permit shall expire and terminate if the
work contemplated under the permit has not been initiated. The County Engineer,
upon written request, may extend the term of a permit for such a period of time
as the County Engineer may determine. If the utility or facility work is to be
completed as part of an access permit, the proposed utility or facility shall
be included on the engineering plans submitted for that review process, but
shall be permitted separately with a utility or facility permit.
 
COMMENTARY:
Examples of types of utilities can include, but are not limited to, electric
lines, telephone lines, telecommunication lines, cable television lines, and
natural gas transmission lines. Examples of types of facilities can include,
but are not limited to, sidewalks, street lights, bike paths, storm sewers,
watermains, sanitary sewer lines, trees, and other municipal or government
owned facilities and general work performed within the right-of-way. Wireless
antenna installation are covered under the "Wireless Telecommunication
Facilities Ordinance".
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.102 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Highway purposes of county highways. The rights-of-way of county
highways are established for the location of highways and the highway
associated appurtenances. Utilities and facilities shall be located within such
rights-of-way in a manner that will not impede or conflict with any existing
highway or associated appurtenance or any future improvement or widening of a
highway and the construction or reconstruction of associated appurtenances. A
utility or facility is not considered a highway appurtenance.
   (B)   Relocation of existing utilities and facilities.
      (1)   Whenever a county highway pavement is widened, reconstructed,
resurfaced, or additional lanes are added and an existing utility or facility
will be under the widened pavement or traffic signal equipment, the owner of
the existing utility or facility or the permittee shall relocate, remove, or
modify the utility or facility from under the widened pavement at no cost to
the county. The County Engineer shall determine the need for said relocation,
removal, or modification on a case by case basis.
      (2)   Any and all additional or extraordinary costs that may be incurred
by the county due to the presence, abandonment, or proposed placement of any
utility or facility within the right-of-way of a county highway shall be borne
solely by the owner of said utility or facility. Payment to the county for said
additional or extraordinary costs shall be made as determined by the County
Engineer.
   (C)   Conflicts with existing utilities and facilities/insufficient space.
      (1)   In the event of the placement, construction, relocation, removal,
modification, abandonment, enlargement, or any manner of work to be performed
on any utility or facility, existing or proposed, within the right-of-way of a
county highway there does not exist sufficient space for said proposed work,
the county is not responsible for providing additional space in any manner or
form. In the event the County Engineer determines that there exists
insufficient space within the right-of-way of a county highway, the proposed
work may not be permitted.
      (2)   In the event a conflict exists between any existing or proposed
utilities or facilities located or proposed to be located within the right-of-
way of a county highway, said conflict shall be resolved by the owners of said
utilities or facilities. The resolution of any conflict shall not result in the
county incurring any costs, either now or in the future, and shall not impede
traffic or hinder the operation of the county highway. The resolution of any
conflict must be approved by the County Engineer if the proposed resolution
involves work to be performed within the right-of-way of a county highway.
   (D)   Other agency requirements and permission. The issuance of a permit
under the provisions of this chapter does not relieve, excuse, diminish, or
negate, in any manner or form, the authority, rules, requirements or permission
that may be required by any governmental authority or person that regulates any
manner of work to be performed on any utility or facility, existing or
proposed, within the right-of-way of a county highway. Prior to or subsequent
to the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this chapter, the owner of
a utility or facility may be required to submit evidence of compliance with the
rules, regulations, and specifications of any other applicable regulatory
agency or person for the work to be performed within the right-of-way of a
county highway.
   (E)   Property owner's permission. The issuance of a permit under the
provisions of this chapter does not relieve the permittee from obtaining
permission from the legal property owner to locate the utility or facility on
any county highway where the right-of-way is in the form of an easement for
public road purposes and the county does not own the right-of-way. The rules,
regulations, and specifications of such permission shall not be in conflict
with the provisions of this chapter nor supersede, diminish, alter, or in any
manner or form, interfere with use of said easement for roadway purposes, nor
shall said permission result in any costs to the county either now or in the
future. Failure to obtain permission can be just cause not to issue a permit or
to suspend or revoke an issued permit.
   (F)   Locating utilities and facilities.
      (1)   The owner of any utility or facility located within the right-of-
way of a county highway shall upon written request determine the location of
its utility or facility as required by the County Engineer to facilitate design
engineering, construction, or maintenance work to be performed on a county
highway. Such locating may include, but are not limited to, exposing the
utility or facility and/or providing distance and depth measures.
      (2)   The locating of a utility or facility shall be performed within ten
working days of the receipt of the request of the County Engineer when
seasonally possible to do so within such timeframe and shall not result in
costs to the county due to delays in the design engineering, construction or
maintenance work contemplated by the county. This requirement to locate
utilities or facilities shall not be construed to be in conflict with damage
prevention efforts of the Joint Utility Locating Information for Excavation
(J.U.L.I.E) program, but a condition of any permit to construct and/or maintain
a utility or facility within a county highway right-of-way. Failure to respond
to such locating requests shall constitute a violation of this chapter, as
detailed in §
90.033.
   (G)   Participation in the J.U.L.I.E. The owner of any utility or facility
to be located within the right-of-way of a county highway shall be a member of
J.U.L.I.E. The only allowed exceptions to J.U.L.I.E. membership are the owners
of a single service connection for water or sanitary sewer within the county
highway right-of-way.
   (H)   Maintenance of utilities and facilities.
      (1)   The owner of a utility or facility located within the right-of-way
of a county highway shall be solely responsible for the use, operation, and
maintenance of the utility or facility. All work performed on a utility or
facility located within the right-of-way of a county highway shall be performed
at no cost to the county and shall be in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   In the event a utility or facility located within a right-of-way of
a county highway becomes a hazard or potential hazard, the owner of the utility
or facility shall immediately take the necessary steps to remedy and alleviate
the hazard or potential hazard, at no cost to the county. Said remedy shall not
alter, diminish, lessen, change, or in any manner or form, limit the use of a
right-of-way for roadway purposes.
      (3)   The owner of the existing utility or facility shall obtain a permit
to perform maintenance on the utility or facility located within the right-of-
way of a county highway. Permit and inspection fees may be waived for minor
maintenance work that does not substantially impact the county highway right-
of-way. The waiver of permit and inspection fees shall be at the discretion of
the County Engineer. All applicable fees under this chapter shall be paid by
the owner for any maintenance work that involves the open cutting of the county
highway pavement.
      (4)   Major maintenance. Major maintenance is the repair or inspection of
an existing utility or facility that requires substantial disturbance of the
county highway and/or right-of-way. Major maintenance or inspection work may
require excavation and roadway lane and shoulder closures. The County Engineer
shall determine whether the work constitutes major maintenance work.
 
COMMENTARY:
Examples of major maintenance can include, but are not limited to, replacing a
valve on an existing water main, replacing an existing utility pole, the
installation or cut off of a single residential service which involves
earthwork, and maintenance work that requires substantial earthwork or
excavation. Any planned maintenance work that requires the open cutting of the
county highway pavement shall be considered major maintenance.
 
      (5)   Minor maintenance. Minor maintenance is the repair or inspection of
an existing utility or facility that requires minimal disturbance of the county
highway right-of-way. The County Engineer shall determine whether the work
constitutes minor maintenance work.
 
COMMENTARY:
Examples of minor maintenance may include, but are not limited to aerial work
on existing utility lines, replacing sections of existing sidewalk in place,
resurfacing a municipal street within the county highway right-of-way,
televising or lining of an existing sewer without disturbing pavement, and
adjusting manholes without affecting county highway pavement.
 
   (H)   Emergency repair work.
      (1)   Emergency repair work may be performed on a utility or facility
located within a right-of-way of a county highway prior to obtaining a permit
to perform the work necessary to remedy the emergency situation. For all
emergencies, the LCDOT shall be notified immediately during business hours and
the Lake County Sheriff's Office shall be notified outside of normal business
hours. The emergency repair notification form, available in the Technical
Reference Manual, shall be submitted to the LCDOT within 24-hours of the
discovery of the emergency. The County Engineer shall determine whether a
permit is required for the work performed. A permit is required for all
pavement open cuts.
      (2)   Emergency repair work traffic control. When emergency work is
needed on the traveled portion of the roadway, immediate steps shall be taken
by the utility or facility company to provide all necessary protection for
traffic on the highway. Applicable traffic control standards in accordance with
the Technical Reference Manual shall be used at all times. The person in charge
shall notify the LCDOT Transportation Management Center (commonly named
PASSAGE) of any lane closure and when the lane re-opens. Any time a portion of
the county highway requires closure outside of normal business hours, the Lake
County Sheriff's Office shall be notified.
      (3)   Emergency work duration. The duration of the work under an
emergency situation by definition is considered 72 hours or less. This time
frame is meant to resolve the immediate emergency and temporary pavement may be
required as part of this job. The county highway shall be open to traffic as
soon as possible. All permanent restoration to pavement, shoulders and right-
of-way that was disturbed as the result of emergency work shall be completed
within one week of the completion of the emergency repair. Should the emergency
occur during the winter months, temporary restoration measures shall be
required until permanent restoration can be completed in the spring.
      (4)   Emergency work permit requirements. Performance of the emergency
repair work does not relieve the owner of the utility or facility of all other
applicable rules, regulations, and specifications, as set forth in this
chapter. A permit application for the emergency work shall be received by the
LCDOT no later than one week after the emergency had been identified.
   (I)   Pavement open cut requirements. Open cutting of pavements degrades the
pavement condition and creates the potential for increased future maintenance
costs. Due to this impact, open cutting of the pavement for any utility or
facility work is discouraged, and all efforts necessary shall be made by the
owner of a utility or facility to avoid open cutting of the pavement. If there
is no reasonable alternative to open-cutting, a request for open cut shall be
made in accordance with the processes and forms contained in the Technical
Reference Manual. No pavement open cuts shall be permitted between November 15
and April 15, except in the case of an emergency repair process.
   (J)   Service connections.
      (1)   The owner of a utility or facility located within the right-of-way
of a county highway shall be responsible for and repair, or cause to be
repaired, damage to any property of the county and shall restore any disturbed
county highway rights-of-way due to any service connections whether installed
by the owner, his or her authorized representative, or by others.
      (2)   Service connections for water service and sanitary sewer service
are allowed to be located within the right-of-way of the county highway
provided that the appropriate permit for said services has been issued and the
appropriate acceptance form has been signed. The LCDOT is not responsible for
re-establishing any service connections damaged by anyone performing work
within the county highway right-of-way.
   (K)   Abandoned utilities and facilities.
      (1)   The owner of any utility or facility shall be responsible for any
utilities and facilities remaining in the right-of-way that have been abandoned
or are no longer in use. This responsibility shall include the location and
removal or the cost of the removal of said utilities and/or facilities that are
in conflict with any highway improvement, construction, and/or maintenance
projects of the county and/or its agents. Should the highway pavement be
widened, the abandoned utility and/or facility shall be removed out from under
the proposed widened pavement or reconstructed at no cost to the county.
      (2)   The County Engineer may determine on a case by case basis that an
abandoned utility or facility may remain in place provided good and sufficient
reasons are presented to the County Engineer in writing by the owner of the
abandoned utility or facility. However, cost of said removal shall not be the
sole reason for a request to leave the abandoned utility or facility in place.
      (3)   Upon a determination by the County Engineer that an abandoned
utility or facility may remain in place, the County Engineer may set forth
conditions and requirements which shall include, but not be limited to, prompt
reimbursement of the county or its agents for costs incurred due to allowing
the abandoned utility or facility to remain in place or filling the abandoned
utility with suitable material to avoid future collapse or failures.
   (L)   Change in permittee status. The permittee shall promptly notify the
county of any actual or proposed change in status (including but not limited to
bankruptcy) or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of
the permittee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major
stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, group of
persons, or group of persons jointly acquiring 5% or more of the voting shares
of the permittee. Said notification shall be in writing and sent to the County
Engineer within 30 days of the change in status.
   (M)   In addition to the rules, requirements, and regulations established by
this chapter and the specifications, requirements and conditions contained in
the Technical Reference Manual, utility requests that fall under the Small
Wireless Facilities Deployment Act shall follow the rules, requirements, and
regulations established by the Lake County Small Wireless Telecommunication
Facilities in Public Rights-Of-Ways Ordinance.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.103 BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES.
   (A)   It is the policy of Lake County to encourage travel by pedestrian and
bicycle facilities. Pedestrian and bicycle facilities should be integral to the
transportation facilities of adjacent neighborhoods and development with access
across the county highway rights-of-way at acceptable locations as determined
by the LCDOT.
   (B)   Bicycle and pedestrian facilities to be constructed along a county
highway may be located in easements outside of the right-of-way of the county
highway or may be located within the right-of-way if the local agency accepts
maintenance responsibility for the facility and sufficient area exists to meet
appropriate design standards. The county reserves the right to reject requests
for permitting of bicycle and pedestrian facilities where insufficient area
exists or where installation of such facilities would create a potential for
unsafe conditions.
   (C)   Bicycle and pedestrian facilities permitted under this chapter shall
not be maintained by the county. The permittee for such facilities must be a
municipal or local agency with sufficient financial and operational resources
to properly maintain and operate said facilities in a manner satisfactory to
the county.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
SPECIAL EVENT POLICIES
§ 90.120 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (A)   The County Engineer, in accordance with 605 ILCS 5/5-414 et seq. as
amended, may issue a permit to temporarily close any portion of a county
highway for any public purpose. Temporary closure of a highway for purpose of
special events of public interest and filming shall be authorized by issuance
of a special event permit.
   (B)   Temporary closures for emergency repairs, natural disasters, or other
emergency conditions are exempt from these requirements.
 
COMMENTARY:
Examples of special events can include, but are not limited to, parades,
marathons, festivals, other special events of public interest and filming for a
movie, television, commercial, or documentary.
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.121 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A special event permit is required for any activity on county highway
right-of-way which impacts or has the potential to impact the traveling public.
Municipal corporations, governmental agencies, or a person or business may
apply for a special event permit. Contact with the LCDOT shall be made by the
applicant in the early stage of the event's planning process, a minimum of 30
days prior to the planned event.
   (B)   Temporary closure of a county highway classified as a designated
freeway, principal arterial, or arterial, may require additional conditions of
approval including, but not limited to, significant coordination with local and
regional emergency service agencies, preparation of a detour plan, notification
of media outlets, placement of changeable message signs on the route prior to
the closure, etc.
   (C)   Route alternatives may have to be considered by the applicant should a
portion of the county highway intended for an event be under construction at
the time of the event.
   (D)   Procedure and requirements for special event permit application are
outlined in the Technical Reference Manual.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.122 TRAFFIC CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Temporary closure of a county highway for a special event will only be
permitted if a suitable detour or alternate route exists which will not overly
delay the motoring public, as determined by the LCDOT. Traffic control
requirements are outlined in the Lake County Highway Permits Technical
Reference Manual.
   (B)   The permittee, not the LCDOT, shall be responsible for advance
notification of temporary closures, the detour route, traffic control,
including signage and police/sheriff presence or assistance if required. The
LCDOT has the authority to require that the permittee have police or sheriff's
presence during the highway closure.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.123 ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS.
   Provisions must be made to allow for safe passage of emergency vehicles
through the closed portion of highway. Written approvals may be required from
emergency service providers if deemed necessary by the LCDOT.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.124 OTHER REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Prior to issuance of a special event permit, the permittee shall
provide the LCDOT with acceptable proof of insurance. Indemnification
requirements are outlined in the Technical Reference Manual.
   (B)   The permittee shall be responsible for cleaning and maintaining the
right-of-way of the county highway during and following the event. In the event
that the permittee fails to remove any debris, litter, signs, or other
appurtenances that were temporarily in place during the closure, upon cessation
of the temporary closure, the LCDOT reserves the right, but does not have the
duty to, perform those activities necessary to remove any debris, litter,
signs, or other appurtenances that were temporarily in place during the closure
without advance notification and bill the permittee for said costs.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.125 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The LCDOT reserves the right to require the cessation of all activity and
removal of the temporary closure if any of the requirements of this chapter or
additional regulations, requirements and conditions imposed by the permit have
not taken place or if the traffic control requirements are not in accordance
with the requirements of the permit.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
§ 90.140 NOTIFICATION OF UTILITY COMPANIES.
   The County, all utility companies, and J.U.L.I.E. must be notified before
construction work commences within the required J.U.L.I.E. notification time
frame. It shall be the sole responsibility of the permittee to have all
underground facilities located prior to the commencement of any construction.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.141 COMMENCEMENT OF WORK.
   No work requested under the provisions of this chapter shall commence until
such time as a permit is issued by LCDOT.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.142 NORMAL AND ROUTINE MAINTENANCE OF COUNTY HIGHWAYS.
   All normal and routine maintenance performed by the LCDOT on county highways
shall take precedence over and supersede all construction, maintenance,
placement, removal, relocation, modification, and use of county highway rights-
of-way as governed by this chapter.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.143 MODIFICATION TO PLANS.
   Any modifications to engineering plans after LCDOT has approved them but
prior to permit issuance must be submitted and approved by the LCDOT prior to
construction.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.144 ACCESS TO HIGHWAYS WITH CURB AND GUTTER.
   (A)   Before an access-related improvement is constructed on a curbed
highway, the existing curb and gutter shall be completely removed within the
access location area. The curb-cut shall be of sufficient width to accommodate
the required access width and curb returns, as well as the full length of any
turning lane and approach treatments that are being installed.
   (B)   Depressed curb and gutter shall be reinstalled at minor access
driveways and may be required at other access types.
 
COMMENTARY:
Removing only the back of a curb and paving over the broken curb section is not
acceptable, since this practice results in an exposed face that is highly
susceptible to spalling or raveling. On highways with mountable curbs, it is
not acceptable to simply pave to the back of the curbing and require motorists
to drive over the curbing.
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.145 WORK ZONE PROTECTION.
   (A)   Appropriate measures shall be taken by the permittee to prevent and
protect the public from any hazards or potential hazards caused by or the
result of any work permitted under this chapter.
   (B)   Traffic control and protection for the safety of the traveling public
in accordance with the Technical Reference Manual and approved engineering
plans shall be in place through the duration of the work. County highway
pavements shall not be broken, cracked, or damaged in any manner or form as a
result of the permitted work. Any dirt, mud, dust, or any form of debris shall
be removed from the highway pavement in a reasonable time frame, or upon
notification by LCDOT.
   (C)   Equipment with grouser pads, cleats, or studs shall not be operated or
allowed on any highway pavement.
   (D)   In the event the permittee violates the rules, regulations, or
specifications of this chapter, the Technical Reference Manual, or the approved
permit documents and refuses to remedy the violation, the County Engineer may,
but has no duty to, order the work to be done to correct the violation. The
permittee shall reimburse the county at a rate not to exceed 130% of the costs
incurred by the county and shall cease all work being performed until such time
as reimbursement has been made and alternate construction methods acceptable to
the County Engineer are approved.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.146 TRAFFIC CONTROL.
   (A)   Traffic control and protection measures are required during
construction. A traffic control plan shall be included within the engineering
plans and specifications submitted to the LCDOT. Should adequate traffic
control measures not be in place, a representative of the LCDOT has the
authority, but not the duty, to halt the construction until such time as the
traffic control measures are corrected.
   (B)   The first infraction will result in the halting of construction until
such time as traffic control measures are corrected. The second infraction will
result in the halting of construction for the remainder of that day. Traffic
control measures must be established prior to the start of the next workday.
Should there be a third infraction, the permit shall be revoked and there shall
be a meeting with the permittee, resident engineer/person in charge, and LCDOT
to discuss what measures will be taken to reinstate the permit.
   (C)   The LCDOT shall have the ability to assess a fine in accordance with §
90.033 of this chapter for any infraction of traffic control requirements.
   (D)   The resident engineer/person in charge shall notify the LCDOT
Transportation Management Center (commonly named PASSAGE), of any upcoming lane
closures (24 hours prior) and immediately when the lane is re-opened to
traffic. Closures of a travel lane for permitted work will only be allowed
between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. on weekdays. Exceptions to this policy may be
granted by the LCDOT Engineer of Traffic on a case by case basis through the
permit review process. Temporary closures for emergency repairs, natural
disasters, or other emergency conditions are exempt from these requirements.
   (E)   Parking or storage of vehicles, materials, or equipment within the
county right-of-way will not be allowed unless otherwise specified in the
permit documents.
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.147 RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPROVEMENTS.

the costs associated with such work. The person in charge shall be present for
such emergency repairs and shall be responsible for any changes or
modifications necessary in the traffic control.
      (2)   Debris removal.
         (a)   The permittee shall be responsible for cleaning and maintaining
the right-of-way of the county highway. Storm sewers and drains shall be kept
free of debris, trash, and other extraneous material at all times. The pavement
surface shall be kept clean and free of mud, gravel, debris, trash, and other
extraneous material at all times. Should the permittee fail to keep the
pavement clean or the drainage functioning properly, the county shall have the
right, but not the duty, to clean the pavement and restore drainage to maintain
a safe and passable highway. The permittee shall be responsible for all costs
incurred by the county for said cleaning.
         (b)   Persistent failure by the permittee to comply with this section
will result in LCDOT revoking the permit and taking any action necessary to
keep the pavement clean and drainage functioning properly. Should the permit be
revoked, there shall be a meeting with the permittee, person in charge, and
LCDOT to discuss what measures will be taken to reinstate the permit.
      (3)   Damage to utilities and facilities. Any damage caused to any

result of an issued access permit. The parties shall proceed as described in §
90.068(C) of this chapter.
   (B)   The amount to be in the escrow shall be equal to the current estimated
cost of the improvement plus 30% of the cost for the county to administer the
improvement. A cashier's check, bank draft, certified check, or bank money
order in the amount equal to 130% of the current estimate of costs of the
improvement shall be made payable to the Lake County Treasurer and shall be
submitted to the County Engineer for deposit in an escrow account to be used
only for the improvement specified. A certificate of deposit shall not be
acceptable.
   (C)   If, within a period of six years from the date of the issuance of an
access permit, the funds deposited in the escrow account, as well as any
interest income earned during that time, have not been used to pay for the
specified improvement, the funds in the escrow account, plus any interest
income earned, shall be returned to the permittee and any further obligation of
the permittee for the specified improvement shall be terminated.
   (D)   The period of time, as specified herein, may be extended upon the
written approval of the County Engineer and the owner.
 
COMMENTARY:
An example of a future improvement requiring escrow funding could be a staged
or phased development over a period of several years. The traffic impact study
may show that a traffic signal is not currently warranted but would be
warranted as subsequent development stages or phases are completed.
 
(Ord. 19-1061, passed 7-9-2019)
§ 90.179 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Proof of insurance for all forms of insurance required by this chapter
shall be provided to the LCDOT prior to the issuance of a permit. This
insurance is to provide protection against all claims for damage to public or
private property, and injuries to persons, arising out of and during the
progress of the permitted work to its completion. The certificate of insurance
must include the permit number or the project name and county highway location
on the certificate. All parties working within the ROW shall be required to
provide proof of insurance.
   (B)   The County Engineer shall determine the minimum acceptable amounts for
the following types of insurance: (1) bodily injury liability and (2) property
damage liability. There shall be no restrictions on occurrence limits. The
County Engineer may, at his or her sole and exclusive discretion, upon receipt
of written application from the permittee substantiating good and reasonable
cause, allow the indemnification to be provided by someone other than the
permittee for a single family homeowner, not for profit organization, or local
agency. The Technical Reference Manual provides detailed information on these
limits and all other insurance requirements not specified in this chapter.
   (C)   The certificate(s) shall contain a provision that coverages afforded
under the policies will not be canceled or non-renewed, and that restrictive
modification cannot be added until at least 30 days after written notice has
been given to the LCDOT. A mere intent to notify the LCDOT of cancellation is
not acceptable. The permittee shall cease, or cause to be ceased, operations,
work, and construction of an improvement if the insurance is canceled or
reduced below the required minimum amount of coverage as determined by the
County Engineer.
   (D)   Insurance coverages which are to remain in force and effect after
completion of the construction will require an additional certificate(s)
evidencing continuation of such coverages.
   (E)   Such additional certificate(s) shall be submitted upon completion and
acceptance of the construction improvements and upon one year thereafter. If
any information concerning reduction of coverage is not furnished by the
insurer, it shall be furnished by the permittee with reasonable promptness in
accordance with the permittee's information and belief. Any acceptance of proof
of insurance by the LCDOT shall in no way limit or relieve the permittee of the
duties and responsibilities assumed by the owner. Acceptance of insurance
certificates not in compliance with the provisions of these requirements by
LCDOT shall not affect or constitute a waiver of these requirements.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES
§ 91.200 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and may be referred to as the “Wireless
Telecommunication Facilities Ordinance.”
(Ord. 18-0757, passed 7-10-2018)
§ 91.201 ENABLING STATUTE.
   The legislature passed Public Act 100-0585, the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act (hereinafter “the Act”), enabling Lake County to pass an
ordinance to adopt rates, fees and terms which comply with the Act for the
collocation of small wireless facilities within the county’s rights-of-way. All
definitions, terms and conditions of the Act are incorporated herein and made a
part hereof without the necessity of repeating all definitions, terms and
conditions. To implement a clear, simplified permitting process, the county is
reiterating some, but not all, of the provisions from the Act. The fact that a
provision from the Act is not specifically listed in this subchapter does not
impact its legal effect. If applicable federal or state laws or regulations
conflict with the requirements of this subchapter, the wireless provider shall
comply with the requirements of this subchapter to the maximum extent possible
without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   Since the Lake County Highway Temporary Closure and Utility and Facility
Placement Ordinance does not sufficiently address the collocation of small
wireless facilities, and the legislature has enacted specific terms which apply
only to small wireless companies who request to locate small wireless
facilities within the county rights-of-way, the county is enacting this new
subchapter, the Wireless Telecommunication Facilities Ordinance.
   Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this subchapter regarding
the siting and installation of wireless telecommunication facilities are more
restrictive than comparable conditions imposed elsewhere in any other local

Enforcement Officer, the attorney for the county, the respondent, or the
attorney for the respondent, the Hearing Officer assigned to hear the case may

or for the production of relevant documents. Service of the subpoena shall be
the responsibility of the requesting party.
   (C)   If, at the time set for hearing, the respondent or his or her attorney

enter a default judgment of liability against the respondent and impose fines
and assess costs. A copy of the order of default shall be served promptly in

setting aside the default judgment and also shall apprise the respondent of the
availability of an appeal of the default judgment to the Circuit Court for the
19th Judicial Circuit, Lake County, IL.

aside, a new hearing date will be set.

chronic nuisance property. If the owner of such property cannot be found after
reasonable efforts, the notice required by this provision may be served upon
the occupant of the property or upon the person or persons causing, permitting,
or maintaining any then-existing nuisances on the property. The notice shall
direct the recipient of the notice to abate or remove such nuisance within 24
hours or such time as is reasonable, and shall state that if the nuisance is

   If the provisions of the public nuisances subchapter conflict with
provisions found in any other adopted ordinances or regulations of the county,
or with any federal or State of Illinois law, the more restrictive provision of
ordinance or law will control. The inclusion of provisions in the public
nuisances subchapter that are also contained in other Lake County ordinances or
regulations does not negate the ability of the Enforcement Officer to enforce
these provisions under the terms and authority of these other ordinances or
regulations. However, in no case shall any provision contained in the public
nuisances subchapter be enforced under the terms and authority of more than one
Lake County ordinance or regulation.

title for such property in the Lake County Recorder's Office a notice that such
property is a chronic nuisance, provided that a further notice shall later be
recorded at such time that the property ceases to be a chronic nuisance
property. A property that is found to be a chronic nuisance property shall
remain a chronic nuisance property until such time that the Enforcement Officer
or the Enforcement Officer's designee certifies that the property has remained
nuisance-free for 24 consecutive months.

provisions of §§
94.30 through

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.01 STANDARD STREET ADDRESS SYSTEM.
   (A)   Official address.
      (1)   Official address. Every parcel of land in unincorporated Lake
County shall have an official site address. For improved parcels, the official
address is to be posted at the access to the property in a prominent location
visible from the street.
         (a)   Standard numbering system. The official address shall follow the
Standard Street Address System unless the conditions of division (A)(1)(b),
below, apply. The addressing system is based on a uniform grid pattern with its
origin beginning at State Street and Madison Street in Chicago. The addressing
numbers increase as they go west and north from that point. The grid number
represents the number of miles west or north from the base street plus an
address number. Lake County's beginning reference point is at the southwest
corner of the county, being 20 miles north of Madison Street and 29 miles west
of State Street in Chicago. Address numbers with a north directional are
assigned even on the west side and odd on the east side of a street. Address
numbers with a west directional are assigned even on the north side and odd on
the south side of a street. Lake County does not contain any south or east
addresses under this system.
         (b)   Local standard numbering system. If an area is found to have
consistent and logical but non-conforming addresses, the addresses in use in
that area may be adopted as the standard for that area. The finding of
consistency would require that the addresses in use assign odd and even
addresses to opposite sides of a street, that addresses ascend in an orderly
manner along the street, and that the addresses are not duplicated in the
surrounding areas. Adopting the addresses in use in such an area as the county
standard would be made in consultation with the fire district providing service
to the area and the Lake County Sheriff's Office.
      (2)   Renumbering required. Renumbering will be required if an existing
unincorporated parcel has an address that is not consistent with the Standard
Street Address System or if the fire protection district, the Lake County
Sheriff's Office or the U.S. Postal Service request assignment of a new
address. The Lake County Chief County Assessment Office shall issue a new
official address using the provisions of division (A)(1), above.
   (B)   Administration.
      (1)   Assignment of address. The assignment of addresses and
determination of consistency in unincorporated areas shall be the
responsibility of the Lake County Chief County Assessment Office.
      (2)   Official address record. The Lake County property tax records
system shall be the official record of addresses for parcels in unincorporated
Lake County. The Lake County Chief County Assessment Office shall maintain and
update the official addresses in this system.
      (3)   Notice of new address. If an address is found to be inconsistent
with the provisions of division (A), above, and will be renumbered, the
property owner of record, as identified in the Lake County property tax records
system, shall be given written notice of the new address. The property owner
shall have 90 days from the date of the letter to become compliant with the
newly assigned address. Failure to do so will subject the property owner to the
enforcement provisions of this section.
   (C)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Enforcement Officer. This section shall be jointly enforced by the
Lake County Planning, Building and Development Department and the Lake County
Sheriff's Office.
      (2)   Warning. The Enforcement Officer shall issue a Warning of Ordinance
Violation when the owner of the property has been given notice of a new address
and has not properly posted the new address. The Warning shall require the
violator to abate the violation(s) within no less than seven days, and shall
state that a Notice of Ordinance Violation may be issued if the Warning is not
adhered to as specified.
      (3)   Notice of Ordinance Violation. If the owner of the property has
previously been issued a Warning of Ordinance Violation and fails to abate the
violation by the date specified in the Warning the Enforcement Officer shall
have authority to issue a Notice of Ordinance Violation. If administrative
adjudication is found to be the appropriate remedy to resolve the violation,
the Notice must be served in accordance with and shall contain all information
specified and required in the Lake County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance
(§§
94.50 through
94.66). Prior to the hearing date documented on the Notice of Ordinance
Violation, the respondent may elect to cease the violation for which the Notice
of Ordinance Violation was issued, pay the fine listed on the Notice of
Ordinance Violation, and not participate in the hearing.

                     COMMENTARY: Bird-friendly materials may be measured by
                     "Threat Factor", or the degree of risk that a material
                     poses to birds, as defined by the most current version
                    of the American Bird Conservancy's (ABC) Threat Factor
                     Index (initially established in October 2011), and as
                     indicated by the percent of times in which birds will
                     not avoid collision. ABC defines "bird-friendly"
                     materials as having a Threat Factor ≤ 30.

(Ord., § 1.2, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.003 APPLICABILITY AND JURISDICTION.
   This chapter shall apply to all development, public and private, within
unincorporated Lake County. All structures and land uses constructed or
commenced hereafter and all enlargements of, additions to, changes in, and
relocations of existing structures and uses occurring hereafter shall be
subject to this chapter, all statutes of this state, the Building Codes of this
county, and all other applicable county ordinances, except as specifically
provided in this chapter.
(Ord., § 1.3, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.004 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   The standards of this chapter are minimum requirements. The issuance of any
permit, certificate, or approval in accordance with the standards and
requirements of this chapter shall not relieve the recipient of the permit,
certificate, or approval from the responsibility for complying with all other
applicable requirements of any other county, state, or federal agency having
jurisdiction over the structures or land uses for which the permit,
certificate, or approval was issued.
(Ord., § 1.4, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.005 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This chapter is intended to protect the health, safety, and general welfare
of existing and future residents of the unincorporated area of Lake County by:
   (A)   Implementing the Regional Framework Plan;
   (B)   Classifying the unincorporated area of the county into zoning
districts;
   (C)   Regulating and restricting the location and use of buildings,
structures, and land for agriculture, natural resource conservation,
recreation, trade, industry, residences, and other uses;
   (D)   Regulating the intensity of uses and structures through density,
intensity, dimensional, and open space standards;
   (E)   Protecting landowners from any adverse impacts associated with
development that occurs in unincorporated Lake County;
   (F)   Implementing land use and open space policies that will preserve
agricultural uses of land, including local food production, and the rural, open
character of the unincorporated area of the county;
   (G)   Controlling development in areas of sensitive natural resources, in
order to reduce or eliminate adverse environmental impacts;
   (H)   Protecting the integrity of watersheds;
   (I)   Promoting sustainable development;
   (J)   Promoting conservation development;
   (K)   Managing growth within the unincorporated area of Lake County by
concentrating development in areas where adequate sewage and water facilities,
roads, and schools now exist or can be provided, and limiting development in
areas where these facilities are not adequate;
   (L)   Protecting the tax base by managing growth within unincorporated Lake
County;
   (M)   Promoting land use patterns that increase efficiency in service
provision and prudent use of fiscal resources and local government
expenditures;
   (N)   Providing standards for all types of dwelling units to ensure access
to decent, sound, sanitary and affordable housing for renters and buyers in
accordance with the goals of the Federal Housing Act of 1949, among which is
the provision of adequate zoning to meet a fair share of the region’s housing
needs;
   (O)   Encouraging provision of affordable housing opportunities near
employment centers and major transportation facilities;
   (P)   Ensuring the continued usefulness of all elements of the highway
system for their planned function by increasing the safety and free flow of
traffic by limiting numbers of intersections and driveways on major roads,
while requiring greater connectivity of local streets;
   (Q)   Ensuring protection from fire, flood, and other dangers;
   (R)   Providing adequate privacy, light, and air; and
   (S)   Gradually eliminating uses, structures, and situations that do not
comply with this chapter.
(Ord., § 1.5, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.006 FLOOD WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection provided by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Nonetheless, greater floods may occur on occasion and flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.
   (B)   This chapter does not imply that areas outside floodplain areas or
that land uses permitted within those areas will always be totally free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create any liability on the
part of or a cause of action against the County Board or any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord., § 1.6, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.007 NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.
   This chapter is intended to repeal the original county ordinance or
resolution that was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution approved by the
County Board to establish initial eligibility for the program.
(Ord., § 1.7, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.008 COMMENTARY.
   Whenever a provision of this chapter requires additional explanation to
clarify its intent, a “Commentary” is included. They have no regulatory effect,
but rather are intended solely as a guide for administrative officials and the
public to use in understanding and interpreting the ordinance.
(Ord., § 1.8, passed 10-13-2009)

   (D)   Site capacity calculations.
      (1)   Calculation of base site area. The first step of the site capacity
calculation process involves the calculation of “base site area”, in accordance
with the following methodology:
Calculation of Base Site Area
Calculation of Base Site Area
Step Determine gross area of site based on an on-site survey.                         —
1
Step Subtract land area of existing roads and land within existing utility and        —
2    drainage easements and existing access easements.
     Subtract land that is not contiguous.                                            —
     A.   A separate parcel that has access to a road and is of sufficient size to
     support independent development but that does not abut, adjoin, or share common
     boundaries with the rest of the development or is rendered physically
     inaccessible to the main parcel by the presence of a railroad, existing land     —
     use, major stream, or other natural or man-made barrier, such that common or
Step integrated use of the two parcels is not physically possible. (Site capacity for
3    these parcels shall be calculated separately.)
     B.   A separate parcel that does not have access to a road or is not of
     sufficient size to support independent development and that does not abut,
     adjoin, or share common boundaries with the rest of the development or is
     rendered physically inaccessible to the main parcel by the presence of a         —
     railroad, existing land use, major stream, or other natural or man-made barrier,
     such that common or integrated use of the two parcels is not physically
     possible, thus rendering the land unavailable for development purposes.
Step Subtract land that was reserved for resource purposes in a previously approved   —
4    subdivision plat (e.g., floodplain or recreation area)
     Subtract land used or proposed for residential uses, whenever a mix of
Step nonresidential and residential uses are proposed. (In the case of the site       —
5    capacity calculation for the proposed residential use, subtract the land
     proposed for nonresidential use.)
        Equals “Base Site Area”
 
      (2)   Calculating Net Site Area. After determining “base site area”,
calculate “net site area” in accordance with the following methodology:
 
Calculation of Net Site Area
Step 1 Determine base site area (see §                                       —
       151.070(D)(1))
       Subtract regulatory floodplains [and flood-prone areas with 100+ acres
Step 2 of tributary drainage area (see §                                     —
       151.071(B))]
Step 3 Subtract wetlands (1/4 Ac. +) (see §                                  —
       151.071(C))
Step 4 Subtract nonlinear water bodies (see §                                —
       151.071(E))
Step 5 Subtract linear water bodies (see §                                   —
       151.071(G))
          Equals “Net Site Area”
 
      (3)   Site capacity calculation (residential). Residential site capacity
shall be calculated in accordance with the following methodology:
         (a)   Maximum number of dwelling units allowed. The first step of the
residential site capacity calculation process involves calculating the maximum
number of dwelling units permitted on the parcel. The following steps are
required to make this calculation:
 
Calculation of Maximum Dwelling Unit Count
Step 1 Take Net Site Area (see §
       151.070(D)(2))
Step 2 Multiply by zoning district maximum density (see §                   x
       151.125)
       Equals Maximum Allowed Dwelling Units (round to nearest whole number) =
 
         (b)   Open space requirements. The second step of the residential site
capacity calculation process involves calculating the amount of “
            1.   Resource-protected land area. The provisions of this
subchapter identify several natural resources that must be protected, in whole
or in part. The area occupied by these identified resources are referred to as
“Resource-Protected Lands.” The total Resource-Protected Land area of a site
shall be calculated in accordance with the following methodology:
Calculation of Resource-Protected Land Area
 Resource Type [1] Land Area of Resource   Protection Ratio  Resource-Protected
                   (Acres)                                   Land Area

                                                         (Acres)
  Regulatory floodplains [and flood-prone areas with
1 100+ acres of tributary drainage area (see §          ( _[3]   x 1.00)      = —
  151.071(B)) [2]]
2 Wetlands (1/4 Ac. +) (see §                           ( _[3]   x 1.00)      = —
  151.071(C))
3 Nonlinear water bodies (see §                         ( _[3]   x 1.00)      = —
  151.071(E))
4 Linear water bodies (see §                            ( _      x 1.00)      = —
  151.071(G))
  Wetland and water body buffers [wetland, linear water
  body and nonlinear water body buffers (see §§        ( _        0.80)      = —
  151.071(D), (F), and (H))]
6 Mature woodlands/groves (see §                        ( _      x 0.70[4])   = —
  151.071(I))
7 Young woodlands (see §                                ( _      x 0.50[4])   = —
  151.071(I))
   Equals total Resource-Protected Land area
[1] If two or more resources overlap, only the resource with the higher protected ratio
shall be calculated.
[2] Uses/developments allowed within floodplains are not required to include floodplains
in calculations.
[3] Land Area of Resource may be reduced pursuant to §
151.146(M)(9) and §
151.148(B).
[4] Woodland resources may be reduced pursuant to §
151.071(I)(6)(e), replacement of woodland credit.
 
            2.   Recreation land area. All residential developments located in
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 Zoning Districts are required to provide recreation
land area to meet the county’s minimum recreation area requirements of 19.5
acres per 1,000 residents, in accordance with the following methodology.
 
Calculation of Recreation Land Area (Residential)
Step 1 Take maximum number of dwelling units proposed             —
Step 2 Multiply by 0.055 (based on county average household size) x    
       Equals total recreation land area required (acres)         0
* No recreation land area is required if the calculation yields a
requirements of less than 0.5 acre.
 
            3.   Total open space area.
               a.   Conventional development. Calculating the open space
required in a conventional development involves adding the Resource-Protected
Land area calculated under subsection (D)(3)(b)1. above and the recreation land
area calculated under subsection (D)(3)(b)2. above.
 
Calculating Required Open Space (Conventional Development)
Step 1 Take total Resource-Protected Land area (from §
       151.070(D)(3)(b)1., above)
Step 2 Add total “Recreation Land Area” (from §                  +
       151.070(D)(3)(b)2., above)
       Equals Minimum Conventional Development Open Space requirement =
 
               b.   Conservation development. The amount of open space required
to be set aside in a conservation development is equal to the zoning district
minimum open space requirement (see §
151.125) or the sum of the Resource-Protected Land area calculated under
subsection (D)(3)(b)1. above and the recreation area calculated under
subsection (D)(3)(b)2. above, whichever results in the greater area.
Calculating Required Open Space
Calculating Required Open Space
Step 1 Take total Resource-Protected Land area (from subsection (D)(3)(b)1.,
       above)
Step 2 Add total Recreation Land Area (from subsection (D)(3)(b)2., above)   +
???    Equals Capacity-Based Open Space Requirement                          =
Step 3 Take Base Site Area (subsection (D)(1))
Step 4 Multiply by zoning district (minimum) open space ratio (see §        x
       151.125)
???    Equals District-Based Open Space requirement                          =
Step 5 Take higher of Capacity-Based or District-Based Open Space            =
       Requirement; equals minimum Open Space Requirement
 
      (4)   Site capacity calculation (nonresidential). Site capacity for
nonresidential development shall be calculated in accordance with the following
methodology:
         (a)   Maximum floor area allowed. The first step of the nonresidential
site capacity calculation process involves calculating the maximum amount of
floor area permitted on the parcel, in accordance with the underlying zoning
district regulations. The following steps are required:
 
Calculation of Maximum Floor Area
Step 1 Take Net Site Area (see subsection (D)(2) above)
Step 2 Multiply by zoning district maximum floor area factor (see §  x
       151.125)
          Equals “Maximum Floor Area”
 
         (b)   Maximum impervious area allowed.
            1.   The second step of the nonresidential site capacity
calculation process involves calculating the maximum amount of impervious area
permitted on the parcel, in accordance with the underlying zoning district
regulations.
            2.   The following steps are required:
 
Calculation of Maximum Impervious Area
Step Take Net Site Area (see subsection (D)(2))
1
Step Multiply by zoning district maximum impervious surface ratio (ISR) (see §  x
2    151.125)
        Equals “Maximum Impervious Surface”
 
         (c)   Open space requirements. The final step of the nonresidential
site capacity calculation process involves calculating the amount of “open
space” that must be preserved and set aside. In the case of nonresidential
development, only Resource-Protected Lands must be set aside. The provisions of
this subchapter identify several natural resources that must be protected, in
whole or in part. The areas occupied by these identified resources are referred
to as “Resource-Protected Lands”. The total Resource-Protected Land area of a
site shall be calculated in accordance with the following methodology:

Protected regulatory floodplain areas shall be designated, owned, and
maintained in accordance with the provisions of §
151.072. Only those passive uses permitted by §
151.072(C)(1) shall be allowed within protected regulatory floodplain areas.
   (C)   Wetlands.
      (1)   Calculation of natural resource area. Wetland areas include any
area that meets the definition of a “wetland” as defined in §
151.271. If the Planning, Building and Development Director determines that
site conditions warrant, a wetland delineation shall be required. Furthermore,
if wetlands are determined to be present, provisions of §
151.146(M) shall apply. Wetland delineations shall be conducted in accordance
with the methodology adopted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Lake
County Stormwater Management Commission, and the USDA Natural Resource
Conservation Service.
      (2)   Protection ratio. All wetlands (100%) with a surface area of one-
fourth acre or more, situated wholly or partially on-site, shall be protected
and maintained as permanent open space unless otherwise expressly provided in
this chapter. This provision applies to all wetland areas that are a part of
one-fourth acre or larger wetland areas, regardless of the size of the wetland
area located on the development site.
      (3)   Protected areas. Mitigation shall be allowed in accordance with §
151.146(M), provided there is no net loss of protected wetlands and the
mitigation occurs in the county. Existing isolated protected wetlands on or
adjacent to a development site shall not be excavated, unless the activity is
part of an approved U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or watershed development
permit. Development or disturbance of a cumulative total of more than one acre
of wetlands shall be allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with
the wetland development standards of §
151.146(M).
      (4)   Resource protection measures. All required protection measures for
wetlands located on the development site shall be installed prior to the
commencement of any site development activity and shall remain in place and in
working, functional order until all site development activities have ceased and
the surrounding area has been permanently stabilized. All required resource
protection measures for wetlands shall be installed around the outer limits of
all wetland buffers, unless any development activity is proposed within the
buffers, in which case the resource protection measures shall be installed
around the outer limits of the wetland.
 
COMMENTARY:
The Lake County Wetland Inventory maps and the aerial photographs available on
the Lake County web page or in the Department of Planning, Building and
Development may be referenced to determine if the wetland present on the
property extends beyond the limits of the property boundary.
 
         (a)   Construction fences. Construction fencing (fluorescent
polyethylene laminar safety netting or approved equivalent) with a minimum
height of three feet shall be installed around the outer limits of all wetland
areas. The fencing shall be entrenched, secured to ground-mounted metal or wood
posts spaced a maximum of ten feet apart and maintained to prevent clearing,
grading, and development activities from encroaching into wetland areas.

feasible storage alternatives exist on the subject site.
         (d)   Designation, use, maintenance, and ownership of protected areas.
Protected wetland areas shall be designated, owned, and maintained in
accordance with the provisions of §
151.072. Only those passive uses permitted by §
151.072(C)(1) shall be allowed within protected wetland areas.
   (D)   Wetland buffers.
      (1)   Calculation of natural resource area. A wetland buffer shall extend
from the edge of the delineated wetland. A property may contain a wetland
buffer that originates from wetlands on adjacent property. The natural resource
protection area shall be calculated in the following manner.
         (a)   For wetlands with a total surface area of one-third acre or
greater but less than one acre, a minimum wetland buffer width of 30 feet shall
be required.
         (b)   For wetlands with a total surface area of one acre or greater,
but less than two and one-half acres, a minimum wetland buffer width of 40 feet
shall be required.
         (c)   For wetlands with a total surface area of two and one-half acres

may be reduced to a minimum of one-half of the wetland buffer width required,
upon approval of the Planning, Building and Development Director, provided that
the total wetland buffer area required is achieved adjacent to the wetland
being buffered. The consultation process of the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may override the ability to average
wetland buffer areas upon approval of the Planning, Building and Development
Director.
      (4)   Protected areas.
         (a)   Areas having state or federal threatened and endangered species
present or for Illinois Natural Area Inventory sites, wetland buffer widths may
be modified upon approval of the Planning, Building and Development Director,
to meet the terms and conditions specified during consultation with the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations. However, any additional
wetland buffer required pursuant to this provision shall not affect the site
capacity calculation. The Planning, Building and Development Director shall
support efforts to protect threatened and endangered species whenever the
efforts are consistent with the stated purposes of this chapter.
         (b)   Areas located within 100 feet from the edge of the delineated
wetlands with slopes exceeding 12% grade shall also be protected and maintained
as permanent open space unless otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.
The Planning, Building and Development Director shall be authorized to allow
improvements such as retaining walls to prevent soil erosion and protect public
safety within protected steep slope areas. Any additional wetland buffer
required pursuant to this provision shall not affect the site capacity
calculation.
         (c)   All existing native vegetation within protected wetland buffer
areas shall be left undisturbed. Protected wetland buffer areas may be regraded
if the Planning, Building and Development Director determines that the
regrading is necessary to stabilize the area, prevent soil erosion or otherwise
protect or enhance the protected wetland buffer area. The protected wetland
buffer area may also be regraded to allow storm-water basins. Access through
protected wetland buffer areas shall be provided, when necessary, for
maintenance purposes. The protected wetland buffer areas shall be restabilized
and re-vegetated with native vegetation immediately after any disturbance or
modification. All runoff will be directed to enter protected wetland buffer
areas as unconcentrated flow or will be treated to remove all silt and sediment
prior to entering the adjacent wetland. In those very limited and unique
circumstances when no other reasonable alternative exists, the Planning,
Building and Development Director shall be authorized to allow direct runoff
into the adjacent wetland with the design and implementation of acceptable best
management practices (BMPs). The Planning, Building and Development Director
shall report that action to the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee within
15 days of the decision or at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning, Building and Zoning Committee.
 
COMMENTARY:
Stormwater basins may be allowed within the protected wetland buffer areas

   (I)   Woodlands and significant trees.
      (1)   Calculation of natural resource area.
         (a)   Mature woodlands. A mature woodland is an area or stand of trees
whose total combined canopy covers an area of 20,000 square feet or more, at
least 50% of which is composed of trees having a diameter breast height of 16
inches or more.
         (b)   Groves. A grove is a stand of five or more individual trees
whose total combined canopy covers an area of less than 20,000 square feet, at
least 50% of which is composed of trees having a diameter breast height of 16
inches or more.
         (c)   Young woodlands. A young woodland is an area or stand of trees
whose total combined canopy covers an area of 20,000 square feet or more, at
least 50% of which is composed of trees having a diameter breast height of at
least three inches and less than 16 inches.
         (d)   Significant trees. Significant trees are trees having a diameter
breast height (four and one-half feet above average ground elevation) of 24
inches or greater for deciduous trees and 12 inches or greater for evergreen
trees.
         (e)   Trees planted for commercial purposes.
            1.   Active commercial nurseries and Christmas tree operations
shall be exempt from the woodland protection standards of this subchapter. If a
commercial nursery operation has been abandoned, the areas shall be subject to
the woodland protection standards of this subchapter.
            2.   In determining whether the areas qualify for protection, the
Planning, Building and Development Director shall be authorized to require the
submission of an assessment of the areas that identifies: the canopy and
understory vegetation; the estimated canopy area; the general health condition
of the trees; and relevant site conditions such as soils or drainage conditions
that may promote or prohibit maturity of the vegetation.
         (f)   Noxious species. Undesirable or non-native tree species such as
Acer negundo (box elder), Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust), Rhamnus
cathartica (common buckthorn), Rhamnus frangula (smooth buckthorn), Ailanthus
altissima (tree of heaven), Morus alba (white or common mulberry), Eleagnus
angustifolia (Russian olive), Eleagnus umbellata (autumn olive), Populus alba
(white poplar) and Ulmus pumila (siberian elm) shall not be considered a
natural resource and shall not require protection under this section.
      (2)   Tree surveys. Tree surveys shall be required for all parcels that
contain mature woodlands, groves, young woodlands, or significant trees. Tree
surveys shall identify the location, size (caliper), species and condition
health rating of all trees having a diameter breast height of 12 inches or
more. Property line and hedge row trees shall be included in the tree survey.
Required tree surveys and inventories shall be conducted by a certified
arborist, professional forester, or by a registered professional in a related
field. The Planning, Building and Development Director may waive all or a
portion of the tree survey requirements if it is determined that no development
will take place within a protected woodland area. A condition health rating
categorizes trees in one of the following health categories: 5) excellent, 4)
very good, 3) good, 2) fair, or 1) poor. The Planning, Building and Development
Director may authorize removal of trees identified as “fair” or “poor” by a
certified arborist or professional forester.
      (3)   Protection ratios. See
Figure 151.071(I).

be protected and maintained as permanent open space except those trees that are
located within the ultimate rights-of-way of existing roads and existing
drainage and utility easements which may be disturbed during construction. All
care and effort shall be applied to locate buildings and improvements in a way
that reduces the need for removal of significant trees.
         (e)   Mixed (mature-young) woodland areas. In woodland areas
containing a combination of young and mature woodlands, the minimum area that
must be protected may be determined by calculating the weighted average
protection ratio applicable to the woodland as a whole, in accordance with the
following formula:
 
Weighted average woodland protection   (Mature woodland area x .70) + (Young
ratio                                = woodland area x 0.50)

      (4)   Protected areas. Areas located within 100 feet from the edge of the
woodlands with slopes exceeding 12% grade shall be protected and maintained as
permanent open space unless otherwise expressly provided in this chapter. The
Planning, Building and Development Director shall be authorized to allow
improvements such as retaining walls to prevent soil erosion and protect public
safety within protected steep slope areas. Any additional buffer required
pursuant to this provision shall not affect the site capacity calculation.
      (5)   Non-protected areas. Woodland areas that are not required to be
protected may be cleared or developed.
      (6)   Resource protection measures. All required protection measures for
woodlands, groves and significant trees located on the development site shall
be installed prior to the commencement of any site development activity and
shall remain in place and in working, functional order until all site
development activities have ceased and the surrounding area has been
permanently stabilized.
         (a)   Construction fences. Construction fencing (fluorescent
polyethylene laminar safety netting or approved equivalent) with a minimum
height of three feet shall be installed around the drip lines of all woodlands,
groves, and significant trees, prior to pruning. The fencing shall be
entrenched, secured to ground-mounted metal or wood posts spaced a maximum of
ten feet apart and maintained to prevent clearing, grading, and development
activities from encroaching into woodlands, groves, and significant tree areas.
         (b)   Soil erosion/sediment control. Soil erosion/sediment control
measures shall be designed, installed and maintained in accordance §
151.146(J) and practices described in the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency/Natural Resource Conservation Service’s Illinois Urban Manual.

any one of the following mechanisms, or combinations thereof:
      (1)   Dedication. Open space may be dedicated to the county, township, an
appropriate public agency, or not-for-profit open space organization that is
willing to accept the dedication, provided the terms of the conveyance have
been reviewed and approved by the Planning, Building and Development Director.
      (2)   Common ownership. Open space may be held in common ownership by a
property owners’ association who shall assume full responsibility for its
maintenance and who shall prevent development and subsequent subdivision of the
open space land for other than open space purposes. In the event that open
space is to be owned and maintained by a property owners’ association,
documents establishing the association, detailing its obligation and otherwise
providing for the maintenance and preservation of open space areas shall be
prepared and submitted with all required plans. Covenants shall provide for the
mandatory inclusion of all property owners for the purpose of being responsible
for continuing maintenance of the open space.
      (3)   Deed restriction.
         (a)   Open space may be held in deed-restricted ownership which
ensures that no development and subsequent subdivision of the open space land
for other than open space uses shall be permitted. The maintenance
responsibility of all open space areas shall be specified and provision shall
be made for guaranteeing this responsibility.
         (b)   Within residential developments, open space designated as
recreational areas, greenway areas or stormwater detention areas shall not be
held in deed-restricted ownership, except when otherwise approved by the

subdivisions wherein each lot contains at least 80,000 square feet, required
open space may be held in deed-restricted ownership. The Planning, Building and
Development Director may approve deed-restricted open space on lots less than
80,000 square feet only when: the subdivision consists of five lots or fewer
and each lot within the subdivision contains at least 40,000 square feet of lot
area; or the resultant open space is contiguous to other open space in the
subdivision or on an adjacent property. Within 15 days of approving deed-
restricted open space in accordance with this section, the Planning, Building
and Development Director shall provide a report to the Planning, Building and
Zoning Committee. The report shall describe the action taken and the basis for
the decision. Deed-restricted open space shall not be allowed in conservation
developments.

      (1)   Omitted land. It is the intent of this chapter that every part of
unincorporated Lake County be included in one of the zoning districts
established by this chapter. Any land located now or in the future outside of
municipalities not shown to be included in a zoning district shall be deemed to
be classified in the AG District.
      (2)   Additional land areas. Any land area that comes under the
jurisdiction of this chapter shall automatically be classified in the AG
District.
      (3)   District boundaries. The following rules govern interpretations
regarding the location of zoning district boundaries.
         (a)   Municipal boundaries. Boundaries shown as following or
approximately following the limits of any incorporated municipality shall be
construed as following those limits.
         (b)   Streets. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries shown
as following or approximately following streets shall be construed to follow
the centerlines of those streets, except in the case of interstate highways. In
the case of interstate highways, boundaries shall be construed as following
rights-of-way lines.
         (c)   Property lines. Boundary lines shown as following or
approximately following platted lot lines or other property lines shall be
construed as following those lines, as shown on the county tax maps.
         (d)   Section lines. Boundaries shown as following or approximately
following section lines, half-section lines, or quarter-section lines shall be
construed as following those lines.
         (e)   Railroads. Unless otherwise indicated on the map, boundaries

§ 151.086 AG, AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Description. The AG, Agricultural District is intended to promote and
protect agricultural land uses. The standards of the AG District are designed
to permit development that is compatible with existing rural character and
agricultural uses such as cropland, pasture land, orchards, vineyards, and
nurseries, confined feeding operations, and equestrian facilities. The AG
District is intended to implement and correspond to the Regional Framework
Plan’s “Agricultural” future land use designation.
   (B)   Uses. Uses are allowed in the AG District in accordance with the use
table of §
151.111.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. All development in the AG District is subject
to the density and dimensional standards of §§
151.125 through
151.132.
(Ord., § 5.2, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.087 RE, RURAL ESTATE DISTRICT.
   (A)   Description. The RE, Rural Estate District is intended to accommodate
very low-density, very large-lot residential development and to provide
permanent protection for areas that develop in such a manner. The district is
intended to accommodate only a very small amount of the county’s future housing
needs, generally serving the housing needs of those who desire to live in a
very rural, very low-density estate areas and are willing to assume the costs
of doing so. Because of the relatively sparse population in RE-zoned areas, the
county will not give high priority to the provision of public services in those
areas. Instead, public service provision by the county will be concentrated in
areas where more intense future development is called for by the Regional
Framework Plan. The very low densities permitted in the RE District generally
permit (in accordance with applicable Lake County Health Department rules) on-
site, individual sewage disposal systems and wells, thereby reducing the need
for inefficient public expenditures. The RE Zoning District is intended to
implement and correspond to the Regional Framework Plan’s “Residential - Large
Lot” future land use designation. Development in this district should follow
the character description in the Regional Framework Plan’s “Rural Large Lot
Subdivisions” or the conservation development section of the “Community
Character” chapter.
   (B)   Uses. Uses are allowed in the RE District in accordance with the use
table of §
151.111.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. All development in the RE District is subject
to the density and dimensional standards of §§
151.125 through
151.132.
(Ord., § 5.3, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.088 E, ESTATE AND R-1 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Description. The E, Estate and R-1 Districts are intended to
accommodate low-density, large-lot residential development and to ensure the
protection of areas that develop in such a manner. These districts are a higher
density version of the very-low density RE District. Like the RE District, the
E and R-1 Districts are expected to accommodate only a very small amount of the
county’s overall housing needs. These districts primarily serve those
households who desire to live in low-density estate areas and are willing to
assume the costs of doing so. Because of the relatively sparse population in E-
zoned and R-1-zoned areas, the county will not give high priority to the
provision of public services in the areas. Instead, public service provision by
the county will be concentrated in areas where more intense future development
is called for by the Regional Framework Plan. The low densities permitted in
the E and R-1 Districts generally permit (in accordance with applicable Lake
County Health Department rules; see Chapter 171) on-site, individual sewage
disposal systems and wells, thereby reducing the need for inefficient public
expenditures. The E and R-1 Districts are intended to implement and correspond
to the Regional Framework Plan’s “Residential-Medium Lot” future land use
designation.
   (B)   Uses. Uses are allowed in the E and R-1 Districts in accordance with
the use table of §
151.111.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. All development in the E and R-1 Districts is
subject to the density and dimensional standards of §§
151.125 through
151.132.
(Ord., § 5.4, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.089 R-2, R-3, AND R-4 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Description. The R-2, R-3, and R-4 Zoning Districts are expected to
accommodate a large percentage of the residential growth projected in
unincorporated Lake County over the 20-year planning horizon covered by the
Regional Framework Plan. The districts are primarily intended to accommodate
moderate density residential development that can be served by the full range
of infrastructure. The districts are generally intended to be applied in areas
with existing infrastructure. The uses and densities allowed in the R-2, R-3,
and R-4 Districts (1.33 to 2.5 units per acre) offer county residents a variety
of housing choices in the moderate density range. The R-2, R-3, and R-
4 Districts are intended to implement the Regional Framework Plan’s
“Residential” future land use designations.
   (B)   Uses. Uses are allowed in R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts in accordance
with the use table of §
151.111.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. All development in the R-2, R-3, and R-
4 Districts is subject to the density and dimensional standards of §§
151.125 through
151.132.

§ 151.090 R-4A, R-5, AND R-6 RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Description. The R-4A, R-5, and R-6 Zoning Districts are also intended
to accommodate a substantial portion of the county’s residential growth over
the 20-year planning horizon covered by the Regional Framework Plan. Because of
the densities allowed and the need for infrastructure and convenient access to
shopping, employment and other uses. In all cases, development in the R-4A, R-
5, and R-6 Districts shall be adequately served by infrastructure. By allowing
many residential development options (from detached houses on medium-size lots
to moderate density, multi-story apartments), the R-4A, R-5, and R-6 Districts
provide the widest range of housing choices for county residents. Although the
R-4A, R-5, and R-6 Districts allow moderate to high residential densities, they
are not generally appropriate for application in areas that are most
appropriately suited to intensive nonresidential development. The R-4A, R-5,
and R-6 Districts are intended to implement the Regional Framework Plan’s
“Residential - Small Lot” and “Residential - Multifamily” future land use
designations.
   (B)   Uses. Uses are allowed in R-4A, R-5, and R-6 Districts in accordance
with the use table of §
151.111.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. All development in the R-4A, R-5, and R-
6 Districts is subject to the density and dimensional standards of §§
151.125 through

adjacent to primary highways. Standards that apply to development in the GO
District ensure that development is visually attractive and well-buffered from
abutting roadways and residential areas. The GO District is appropriate for
application to areas that have been developed with office and research park
uses. It may also be used to accommodate new development proposals that are or
can be served by infrastructure. The GO District is intended to implement the
Regional Framework Plan’s “Office/Research” future land use designation.

§ 151.112 USE STANDARDS.
   Unless otherwise noted, the use standards of this section apply to
respective use types whether they are allowed as permitted uses, conditional
uses, or accessory uses.
   (A)   Adult-use cannabis facilities.
      Preface. It is the purpose and intent of this section to provide zoning
regulations of facilities that dispense, grow, process, infuse, cultivate and
transport adult-use cannabis within unincorporated Lake County as allowed by
the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, 410 ILCS 705 (Act). Certain provisions of
the Act are referenced in the section as “Commentary”. This section is not
intended to occupy any regulatory field over which the State of Illinois was
granted jurisdiction under the Act and all facilities shall comply with the
regulations provided in the Act. The Act may be amended from time-to-time, and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and it is the intent of this section to be
read in conjunction with any amendments to the Act and regulations promulgated.
Pursuant to § 55-256 of the Act, any conflict between the Act and this section
shall be resolved in favor of the Act. Approved business establishments shall
not commence operations until an adult use license has been procured from the
appropriate state authority per the Act.
      (1)   Adult-use cannabis dispensary.
         (a)   The use shall be subject to site capacity/site plan review
procedures of §
151.070.
         (b)   Adult-use cannabis dispensaries proposed within certain zoning
districts shall comply with the general development standards as specified
within this code. These standards shall include separation from protected uses,
setbacks, buffering, parking, signage, outdoor lighting, site layout, access,
hours of operation, exterior displays, advertising, and security. Approval of
site capacity/site plan review may be obtained concurrently at the time of any
required conditional use permit.
         (c)   Applicant shall install building enhancements, such as security
cameras, lighting, or other improvements, as set forth in the conditional use
permit, to ensure the safety of employees and customers of the dispensary.
These improvements shall be determined based on the specific characteristics of
the dispensary floor plan and the building site.
 
COMMENTARY:
All dispensaries shall comply with the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (410
ILCS 705) and all rules and regulations adopted in accordance thereto.
 
         (d)   Dimensional standards.

property line of a pre-existing daycare center, day care home, or residential
care home, college, hospital, park, or library; or within 1,000 feet of a
public or private nursery school, preschool, primary, or secondary school.
Learning centers and vocational/trade centers shall not be classified as a
public or private school for purposes of this section. In all cases, the buffer

areas considered unbuildable, practically inaccessible or otherwise unusable by
occupants for the “sensitive use” due to the presence of protected natural
resources such as wetlands, non-navigable water bodies, or other impassable/
unbuildable natural features. For forest preserve property, the determination
of applicable properties shall be made after consultation with forest preserve
staff to account for current or future plans for improvements of structures
within sensitive areas that would allow areas to be accessible or usable.
            2.   Measurement. For the purposes of the minimum distances
section, distances shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects, from the nearest point on the property line
of the lot on which an applicable dispensary is located to the nearest point on

minimum of 30 feet from its surrounding property lines.
            4.   Each dispensary shall be a minimum of 1,500 feet from all
other dispensaries, as measured from the applicable property lines.
         (e)   Parking.
            1.   For purposes of determining required parking, dispensary
applicants shall submit a parking plan for review and approval that includes

on peak demand during initial opening (minimum three-month period).
               B.   Phase 2 Parking Plan. Denote adequate parking supply based
on peak demand during normal operations commencing after the conclusion of
Phase 1.
               Peak demand shall be determined by analysis of reliable data
collected from similar uses. The parking plan shall specifically address the
unique operational needs of the business and include a parking narrative and
traffic management plan that provides site-specific details addressing traffic
circulation, stacking, queuing, etc.
            2.   Visibility and security. Parking shall be located in an area
which is visible from a public road or a private road that is accessible to the
public. It cannot be screened from the roadway with vegetation, fencing, or
other obstructions. Parking areas shall be well lit and monitored by video
surveillance equipment whose live images can be viewed by dispensary staff and
are continually recorded in a tamper-proof format.
         (f)   Exterior display. No dispensary shall be maintained or operated
in a manner that causes, creates, or allows the public viewing of adult-use
cannabis, adult-use cannabis infused products, or cannabis paraphernalia or
similar products from any sidewalk, public or private right-of-way or any
property other than the lot on which the dispensary is located. No portion of
the exterior of the dispensary shall utilize or contain any flashing lights,
search lights, or spotlights or any similar lighting system.

      (Preface.) This county’s recreational vehicle parks have enjoyed a long
history. Nonetheless, a number of parks have been the source of environmental,
traffic, aesthetic, and other negative impacts on surrounding communities. The
following regulations have been adopted and shall be enforced in order to
minimize the conflict between the recreational vehicle parks and the neighbors
surrounding these parks and to ensure that the health, safety, and welfare of
recreational vehicle park residents and neighbors is protected, enhanced, and
maintained. Specifically, these regulations establish standards for the design,
construction, alteration, extension and maintenance of recreational vehicle
parks and related utilities and facilities; authorize the issuance of permits
for construction, alteration, and extension of recreational vehicle parks; and
provide for the licensing and inspection of recreational vehicle parks.

COMMENTARY:
In general terms, Illinois Statutes establish the following regulations for
Telecommunications Facilities:
Regardless of location or height, an antenna may be attached to any existing
structure or new structure permitted by this section (a “qualifying structure”)
provided that the antenna does not extend more than 15 feet above the height of the
structure.
A residentially zoned lot that is less than 2 acres in size and is used for
residential purposes shall not be used for a facility. The height of a
telecommunications facility shall not exceed 75 feet if the telecommunications
facility will be located in a residential zoning district or 200 feet if the
telecommunications facility will be located in a nonresidential zoning district. No
portion of a telecommunications facility’s supporting structure or equipment
housing shall be less than 15 feet from the front lot line of the facility lot or
less than ten feet from any other lot line. If the supporting structure is an
antenna tower other than a qualifying structure then (1) if the telecommunications
facility will be located in a residential zoning district, the telecommunications
facility shall be set back from the nearest residentially zoned lot by a distance
of at least 50 percent of the height of the telecommunications facility's
supporting structure or (2) if the telecommunications facility will be located in a
nonresidential zoning district, the horizontal separation distance to the nearest
principal residential building shall be at least equal to the height of the
telecommunications facility’s supporting structure.
The county’s review of a building permit application for a telecommunications
facility shall be completed within 30 days. If a decision of the County Board is
required to permit the establishment of a telecommunications facility, the county’s
review of the application shall be simultaneous with the process leading to the
County Board’s decision.
 
 
The County Board may grant variations affecting the location, height or setback of
a facility, after a public hearing on the proposed variations conducted before the
Zoning Board of Appeals, by a favorable vote of a majority of the members present
at a meeting held no later than 75 days after submission of an application. If the
County Board fails to act on the application within 75 days after submission, the
application shall be deemed to have been approved. In its consideration of an
application for variations, the County Board and Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider only those standards specified by Statute. It is Lake County's desire to
minimize the erection of new cellular communications towers. To that end, Lake
County encourages new antennas to be located on existing, permitted structures.
When this is not possible or practical, a lot located outside of a residential
zoning districts is the most desirable location. A lot within a residential zoning
district that is not used for residential purposes is the next most desirable
location. The least desirable allowed location is a residentially zoned lot of
more than two acres which is used for residential purposes.
It is also Lake County’s desire to minimize the impact of new cellular
communication towers on surrounding property. To that end, the County encourages
new towers to utilize “stealth technology”. For purposes of this commentary,
“stealth technology” means those features, materials, or equipment that are
designed to hide, disguise, or otherwise soften the appearance of towers.
 
   (AAA)   Utility installation and service, public or private. A conditional
use permit shall be required of all buildings and structures not specifically
exempted from zoning regulations by state statutes and not specifically
permitted by right within a zoning district, pertaining to water, sanitary
sewer, gas, telephone, and electric utilities. Any sewage treatment involving
surface discharge or land application not exempted by state statute shall
require a conditional use permit. Regardless of exempt or non-exempt status,
all public and private utility installations shall comply with the site
development regulations of §§
151.145 through
151.154.

prevent vehicles from encroaching on required setbacks. In lieu of providing
side and rear setbacks, landowners of adjoining properties shall be entitled to
enter into an agreement that provides for a waiver or partial waiver of the
requirements. The agreement shall be in the form of a covenant or deed
restriction and shall require approval of the Planning, Building and
Development Director. Once approved, the agreement shall be recorded by the
County Recorder of Deeds and shall run with the land.
      (2)   Operational requirements. All vehicle repair uses shall comply with
the following operational requirements: no vehicles shall be parked outdoors on

Zoning District. For purposes of this provision, outdoor storage of vehicles
will be deemed to have occurred if a vehicle remains outdoors for over 14
consecutive days or if a vehicle does not have current license tags and remains
outdoors for any length of time. Regardless of the above, a vehicle repair use
may have 15% of the site area, excluding area in floodplain and wetland,
designated for long-term parking of vehicles that are either in the process of
repair or title acquisition. This area shall be fenced-in with an eight-foot
high solid fence. No vehicles shall be stored in this area for more than three

      (1)   General. Some types of work can be conducted at home with little or
no effect on the surrounding neighborhood. The home occupation regulations of
this subsection (E) are intended to permit residents to engage in customary
home occupations, while ensuring that the home occupations will not be a
detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding area. The
regulations require that home occupations (an accessory use) remain subordinate
to the allowed principal use (residential) and that the residential viability
of the dwelling unit is maintained. Approval of a zoning certificate shall be
required.
      (2)   Allowed uses. The home occupation regulations of this subsection
(E) establish performance standards rather than detailed lists of allowed home
occupations. Uses that comply with all of the standards of this subsection (E)
will be allowed as home occupations unless they are specifically prohibited.

not in detached buildings or garages.
      (10)   Exterior appearance. There shall be no visible evidence of the
conduct of a home occupation when viewed from the street right-of-way or from
an adjacent lot. There may be no change in the exterior appearance of the
dwelling unit that houses a home occupation or the site upon which it is
conducted that will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or
function. Examples of the prohibited alterations include construction of
parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior
lighting.

standards for the preparation and sale of food under a cottage food operation,
including compliance with applicable health regulations.
 
   (G)   Rural home occupation.
      (1)   General. The purpose of rural home occupations is to provide a
means to allow business activity of a greater intensity than that of a
customary home occupation, while still maintaining compatibility with the rural
character of the surrounding area. Residents on larger lots located in rural
areas may be able to conduct higher intensity uses with little or no effect on
surrounding properties. The business activity shall be conducted within the
dwelling or one accessory building. The use of the property for a rural home
occupation must be clearly incidental and subordinate to the residential use.
      (2)   Allowed Uses. The rural home occupation regulations of this
subsection (G) establish performance standards rather than detailed lists of
allowed rural home occupations. Uses that comply with all of the standards of
this subsection (G) will be allowed as rural home occupations unless they are
specifically prohibited. The rural home occupation must be clearly incidental
to the use of the dwelling as a residence.
      (3)   Where allowed. The minimum lot size for a rural home occupation is
80,000 square feet. For zoning lots less than 80,000 square feet, the
provisions of §
151.113(E) shall apply. The rural home occupation may occupy either a portion
of the principal residential dwelling or one accessory building. Detached
accessory structures, which are used in conjunction with a rural home
occupation, shall conform to all applicable principal setback and building
separation requirements.
      (4)   Size. Operations and storage associated with the rural home
occupation shall occupy less than 50% of the floor area of the principal
dwelling unit or in one accessory building. The portion of the accessory
building devoted to the rural home occupation shall not exceed 1,000 square
feet. Incidental office work occurring in the principal structure in
conjunction with the primary use of an accessory structure for the rural home
occupation shall not apply towards the allowable gross floor area.
      (5)   Prohibited uses. Prohibited uses include outdoor storage, repair of
large equipment, vehicle repair not incidental to the maintenance or repair of
vehicles associated with the home occupation, dispatch centers, and kennels.
Barber shops, beauty shops, and nail salons are allowed only when served by

structures shall be located a minimum of 30 feet from any existing structures
on any adjoining parcel, such as dwellings, nonresidential buildings, patios,
porches, gazebos, decks, but not including swimming pools or storage structures
such as garages or sheds. Given the unique impacts of non-customary

         (a)   Development projects necessitating the accessory importation of
fill material between 500 and 2,000 cubic yards per acre, provided total fill
volume is 60,000 cubic yards or less, shall require a delegated conditional use
permit in all zoning districts. In addition to seeking a delegated conditional
use permit, minor projects that meet the criteria of this subsection must
follow all site specifications, site plan review requirements, application
requirements, operating standards and other conditions listed in §
151.112(JJ) Major Fill/Grade Operations, with the exception of the fill area
setback requirements which shall be established by the conditional use permit.
         (b)   All projects consisting of the importation of fill as a
principal use at a scale less than a major fill/grade operation shall require a
delegated conditional use permit in all zoning districts.
 
COMMENTARY:
Development projects necessitating the accessory importation of fill material
up to 500 cubic yards per acre are allowed in all zoning districts, provided
total fill volume is 10,000 cubic yards or less (but see subsection (1)b above
for standards governing minor principal fill/grade operations).
 
 
COMMENTARY:
Any projects importing over 2,000 cubic yards per acre of fill or a total fill
volume of greater than 60,000 cubic yards are considered a major fill/grade
operation and are subject to the standards set forth in Section
151.112(JJ) Major Fill/Grade Operations.

DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
§ 151.125 DENSITY AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS TABLES.
   The following tables (
151.125(1) through
151.125(5)) establish standards for development in all base zoning districts.
 
COMMENTARY:
The residential and non-residential density and dimensional standards of this
section are not a “guarantee” of development intensities. Other factors such as
public facility availability, infrastructure capacity, building layout, and parking
configuration may have the effect of limiting development intensity more than the
stated standards. The inability to attain allowed development intensities shall not
serve as justification for adjusting other standards.

[1] Single-family dwellings  in the AG, RE, and E Zoning Districts may exceed the 40-foot building height limit by providing additional
setbacks, as follows: for each 1 foot of additional height above 40 feet, structures shall be set back from all front, side, and rear
property lines by two feet more than the otherwise required minimum setback. Structures in the AG, RE, or E Districts shall not exceed 50
feet in height.
[2] ISR shall be calculated by dividing the total area of all impervious surfaces on the site by the site’s base site area.
[3] A transition yard may also be required, which may increase the minimum setback shown in this table. See §
151.167(J).
[4] Any setback from a railroad right-of-way need not exceed 5 feet. A transition yard shall not be required in this instance.

(Ord., § 7.6, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.131 MEASUREMENTS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Lot size. Lot size refers to the amount of horizontal land area
contained within lot lines of a lot, excluding streets, easements for street
purposes, and street rights-of-way.
   (B)   Lot width. Lot width refers to the horizontal distance between side
lot lines. Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines at the minimum
required front setback line (see
Figure 151.131(B)). When a lot has more than one street lot line, lot width
shall be measured along the street lot line with the narrower width. In R-1 and
more restrictive zoning districts, the minimum average width of lots at the
terminus of a cul-de-sac and on curvilinear streets shall comply with the
minimum width requirements of the underlying zoning district, provided that the
width measured at the building setback line shall be at least 50% of the
specified lot width but not less than 45 feet.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3052.jpg]
      (1)   Panhandle lot exception. Panhandle lots may be allowed in
subdivisions established pursuant to the standards of this chapter.
         (a)   Permitted use of panhandle lots.
            1.   A panhandle lot exception may be used to facilitate creation
of a two-lot subdivision out of a parcel that has sufficient area but
insufficient width to be subdivided.
            2.   A panhandle lot may be used to eliminate access to collector
or arterial roads (see
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(a)2.).
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(a)2.: Panhandle Lot Used to Avoid Access to Collector or
Arterial Road
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3054.jpg]
            3.   A panhandle lot may be used when the buildable area of a
parcel is restricted due to the presence of a natural resource or irregular
property shape (see
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(a)3.).
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(a)3.: Panhandle Lot Used Due to Presence of Natural
Resource
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3056.jpg]
         (b)   Prohibited use of panhandle lots.
            1.   Panhandle lots shall not be used to avoid the development of
publicly dedicated streets otherwise required by this chapter when the effect
of their use would be to increase the number of access points (driveways) on a
publicly dedicated road right-of-way (see
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(b)1.).
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(b)1.: Panhandle Lots May Not Be Used to Avoid Public
Street Creation
    If Their Effect Would Be to Place Additional Driveways on Public Roads

IMAGES/0-0-0-3058.jpg]
            2.   A panhandle lot shall not be used when an adjoining parcel of
land also has sufficient area but insufficient width to otherwise be
subdivided. In these cases, in lieu of platting a panhandle lot, a half-width
road right-of-way shall be platted along the common property line to facilitate
the platting of a full-width road right-of-way if and when the adjoining
property is subdivided (see
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(b)2.).
Figure 151.131(B)(1)(b)2.: Half-width Right-of-way in Lieu of Panhandle Lot
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3060.jpg]
         (c)   Standards for panhandle lots.
            1.   The panhandle of a panhandle lot shall take direct access to a
publicly dedicated street right-of-way.
            2.   The panhandle of a panhandle lot shall not be less than 15
feet in width at its narrowest point.
            3.   The minimum street setback on a panhandle lot shall be
established at a distance equal to the required street setback from the
property line that is most parallel to the street lot line (road right-of-way
line). The lot width at this minimum required setback shall not be less than as
otherwise required by this chapter.
            4.   The area within the panhandle of a panhandle lot shall not be
counted as lot area for the purpose of meeting the minimum lot area
requirements of this chapter.
            5.   If required by the highway authority having jurisdiction over
the road on which the panhandle lot will take access, the panhandle of the lot,
or portion thereof, shall contain an access easement to allow the adjoining lot
to share access to the road. In no case shall the panhandle of a panhandle lot
serve as any access easement for more than two dwelling units.
      (2)   Parking court exception. Parking courts shall be allowed in
subdivisions established pursuant to the standards of this chapter. Parking
courts are easements that serve as parking areas and access driveways for
conservation residential structure types. Through the use of parking courts,
structures obtain their required lot width from a parking court rather than a
publicly dedicated street right-of-way. Parking courts shall be owned and
maintained by the adjoining unit or property owners’ association and are
distinct in form and function from publicly dedicated road rights-of-way.
Parking courts shall comply with the following standards (see
Figure 151.131(B)(2)).
Figure 151.131(B)(2): Parking Court
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3062.jpg]
         (a)   No fewer than three and no more than 16 dwelling units may
obtain their required lot width from a single parking court.
         (b)   Dwelling units and structures gaining access from parking courts
shall provide the same lot width along a parking court and the same street
yards from the parking court as otherwise required along and from a publicly
dedicated road right-of-way by this chapter.
         (c)   Parking courts may be used to satisfy part or all of the off-
street parking requirements of §
151.165. Regardless of the number of off-street parking spaces required by §
151.165(B), at least one off-street parking space per dwelling unit shall be
provided in the parking court.
         (d)   Parking courts shall be located outside of public right-of-way.
         (e)   The design of parking courts shall conform to the following
engineering and geometric standards.
            1.   Access to a parking court from the adjoining publicly
dedicated road right-of-way shall be limited to one entry drive unless
otherwise approved by the appropriate highway authority. The entry drive shall
be a minimum of 18 feet in width. One-way drives may be reduced to 14 feet in
width.
            2.   A depressed curb section shall be provided at the intersection
of the entry drive pavement and the publicly dedicated road right-of-way
pavement.
            3.   The minimum size of a parking space within the court shall be
nine feet by 18 feet.
            4.   The required landscaping adjacent to the publicly dedicated
road right-of-way shall be broken only by the entry drive. No parking shall be
permitted within the required landscaping.
            5.   Parking courts shall contain no more than 75% impervious
coverage.
            6.   Parking courts shall be paved in conformance with the
following standards:
 
1.5-inch bituminous surface course Class I
1.5-inch bituminous binder course  Class I
8-inch aggregate base course       Class A or B
 
            7.   Adequate pavement drainage and snow storage areas shall be
provide within parking courts.
         (f)   Street landscaping shall not be required between a parking court
and the adjoining dwelling units or structures. However, parking courts shall
be landscaped with two canopy trees, three understory trees and nine shrubs for
every three dwelling units taking access from the parking court. Care shall be
taken in the selection and siting of landscape plant materials so as not to
create any site distance or other traffic and pedestrian hazards.
   (C)   Setbacks.
      (1)   Defined. Setbacks refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area
between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the
lot on which the structure is located. Setbacks shall be unobstructed from the
ground to the sky except as expressly stated.

   (E)   Height.  
      (1)   Building height. Building height refers to the vertical distance
between the mean elevation at finished grade along the portion of a structure
to the highest point of the roof.
      (2)   General exceptions to height limits. The following structures or
parts thereof are exempt from zoning district height limits:
         (a)   Agricultural buildings, but not dwellings;
         (b)   Bulk storage silos and towers;
         (c)   Chimneys and cupolas on residential dwelling units, not to
exceed six feet above the height of the building, or the minimum height
required to meet applicable building, fire, or environmental regulations;
         (d)   Roof-mounted solar energy systems are exempt from zoning
district height limits. However, roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not
exceed six feet above the height of the building, or the minimum height
required to meet applicable building or fire regulations.
         (e)   Elevator penthouses and mechanical equipment, provided the
structures do not occupy more than 33% of the area of the roof;
         (f)   Gravity feed apparatus;
         (g)   Flagpoles, radio/television antennae and towers, not to exceed
15 feet above the maximum height allowed in the underlying zoning district
without approval of a variation (see §
151.056);
         (h)   Steeples, not to exceed 25 feet above the maximum height allowed
in the underlying zoning district without approval of a variation (see §
151.056);
         (i)   Towers, fire, mechanical and smokestacks, not to exceed 16 feet
above the maximum height allowed in the underlying zoning district without
approval of a variation (see §
151.056);
         (j)   Water tanks and standpipes; and
         (k)   Emergency warning devices, not to exceed 60 feet in height.
   (F)   Maximum density. Maximum density refers to the maximum number of
dwelling units allowed per acre of site area, after subtracting land area in
regulatory floodplains, wetlands, water bodies, and public rights-of-way from
the base site area. To calculate the number of dwelling units allowed on a
parcel, first subtract from the base site area the total area of all regulatory
flood-plains, wetlands, water bodies, and public rights-of-way, then multiply
the resulting figure by the maximum density standard of the zoning district.
When density calculations result in fractions, fractions of one-half or greater
shall be rounded to the next highest whole number; fractions of less than one-
half shall be rounded down (see
Figure 151.131(F)).

Gross site area: 20.00 acres
Subtract ROW:    0.10 acres
Base site area:  19.90 acres
Subtract
Wetland:         00.75 acres
Floodplain       1.00 acres
Net site area:   18.15 acres x R1 density
18.15 x 0.80 = 14.52 (15) dwelling units
 
   (G)   Open space ratio. The minimum open space ratio is one measure of the
amount of open space required in a conservation development.
   (H)   Floor area factor. Floor area refers to the sum total floor area of a
building, measured from the exterior limits or faces of the structure. Parking
structures providing spaces to meet minimum off-street parking standards of §
151.165 shall not be counted as floor area. The maximum floor area factor
refers to the amount of floor area allowed per acre of Net Site Area, as
calculated under §
151.070(D). The maximum floor area factor is one of the key determinants of a
site’s nonresidential development capacity.
   (I)   Number of dwelling units. The Planning, Building and Development
Director shall be authorized to allow exceptions to the minimum and maximum
number of dwelling units per building for townhouse, multiplex, and multi-
dwelling structures, provided that the average number of dwelling units per
building within a development is neither fewer than the minimum nor more than
the maximum number of dwelling units permitted for the structure type.
   (J)   Walls. The Planning, Building and Development Director shall be
authorized to reduce side and rear wall requirements for patio and atrium
houses if the Planning, Building and Development Director determines that the
walls are only providing a separation from common open space.

§ 151.132 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUDS).
   (A)   Description. The planned unit development (PUD) regulations of this
section are intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design that
achieve a high level of environmental protection, energy efficiency,
aesthetics, high-quality development, and other county goals by:
      (1)   Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results
from strict application of zoning standards that were designed primarily for
development on individual lots;
      (2)   Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access,
light, open space, and design amenities; and
      (3)   Promoting quality design and environmentally sensitive development
by allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics,
locations, and land use arrangements.
   (B)   Intent. By allowing more flexibility than base zoning districts, a PUD
is intended to result in:
      (1)   Greater choice in the type of environment and living units
available to the public;
      (2)   More open space through conservation development practices;
      (3)   Open space resources that are connected to one another and to
residential and nonresidential areas;
      (4)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development;
      (5)   An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities
and streets and thereby lower housing costs; and
      (6)   Promotion of mixed use development.
   (C)   Zoning districts. A PUD may be approved in any base zoning district,
except the AG, RE, and OS Districts.
   (D)   Minimum site area. There is no minimum site area requirement for a
PUD. The proposed PUD shall be consistent with the surrounding existing
development in the area.
   (E)   Compliance with other regulations. Unless expressly authorized by the
regulations of this chapter and specifically approved as part of a PUD, none of
the otherwise applicable standards of this chapter may be waived or reduced as
part of a PUD approval.
   (F)   Approval procedures. PUDs shall be reviewed and approved in accordance
with the procedures of §
151.051. If the proposed PUD involves subdivision of land, the preliminary
plat, preliminary engineering, final plat, and final engineering shall be
subject to the procedures, standards and requirements of §§
151.185 through
151.204 unless specifically modified or waived by the conditional use permit.
   (G)   Allowed uses.
      (1)   Residential zoning districts.
         (a)   PUD approval. Residential uses and only those nonresidential
uses allowed in the GO and LC Zoning Districts (by right or by conditional use
permit) shall be allowed in PUDs located in residential zoning districts.
Nonresidential uses allowed in the GO and LC Zoning Districts by conditional
use permit must be specifically approved within the PUD by the County Board.
         (b)   Change of use. Upon PUD approval, any change of use to a use
allowed by right in the underlying zoning district or the GO and LC Zoning
Districts shall be allowed provided all applicable use and development
standards are met. Any change of use to a use allowed by conditional use permit
in the GO and LC Zoning Districts shall require a conditional use permit.
      (2)   Nonresidential zoning districts.
         (a)   PUD approval. Any use or mix of uses may be allowed within a PUD
in a nonresidential zoning district provided that those uses not allowed by
right in the underlying zoning district shall be specifically approved within
the PUD by the County Board.
         (b)   Change of use. Upon PUD approval, any change of use to a use
allowed by right in the underlying zoning district shall be allowed provided
all applicable use and development standards are met. Any change of use to a
use not allowed by right in the underlying zoning district shall require a
conditional use permit.
   (H)   Standards. Development within PUDs shall not be subject to the
dimensional and bulk standards (i.e., lot size, lot width, setback, height
standards, and building area) of the underlying zoning district. Dimensional
and bulk standards shall be established at the time of PUD approval. Similarly,
landscaping, lighting, parking, architectural and open space standards may also
be established, at the time of PUD approval.
   (I)   Density and intensity.
      (1)   Residential PUDs (residential uses only). The maximum density
(number of dwelling units) within a residential PUD in a residential zoning
district may exceed the conventional development density allowed in the
underlying zoning district by up to 15% if approved by the County Board as part
of the PUD preliminary plan approval. The maximum density (number of dwelling
units) within a residential PUD located in a nonresidential zoning district may
exceed the conventional development density allowed in the R-6 Zoning District
by up to 15% if approved by the County Board as part of the PUD preliminary
plan approval. PUDs shall be subject to the natural resource protection
standards of §§
151.070 through
151.072. No other density bonus may be used in combination with the PUD.
      (2)   Nonresidential PUDs (nonresidential uses only).
         (a)   The maximum intensity (amount of floor area and/or amount of
impervious surface) within a nonresidential PUD may exceed that allowed in the
underlying nonresidential zoning district by up to 15% if approved by the
County Board as part of the PUD preliminary plan approval.
         (b)   The maximum intensity (amount of floor area and/or amount of
impervious surface) within a nonresidential PUD in a residential zoning
district may exceed the intensity standards of the LC Zoning District by up to
15% if approved by the County Board as part of the PUD preliminary plan
approval.
         (c)   PUDs shall be subject to the natural resource protection
standards of §§
151.070 through
151.072.
      (3)   Mixed use PUDs (residential and nonresidential uses).
         (a)   Residential density and nonresidential intensity (impervious
surface ratio, floor area ratio) within mixed use PUDs shall be established at
the time of PUD approval, provided that nonresidential uses shall occupy at
least 30% of the total floor area within the PUD (residential and
nonresidential uses included). Conditions shall be imposed by the County Board
relating to the phasing of the residential and nonresidential components of a
mixed use PUD.
         (b)   PUDs shall be subject to the natural resource protection
standards of §§
151.070 through
151.072.
 
COMMENTARY:
The County Board may condition any density bonuses for a PUD on the site and
buildings thereupon meeting various environmentally sustainable goals,
including sustainable site development, pedestrian-orientation and reduced
vehicle trips, water savings, energy efficiency, sustainable construction
materials selection, and indoor air quality consistent with the U.S. Green
Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building
and site certification program.
 
   (J)   Identification on zoning maps. Approved planned unit developments
shall be indicated on the Official Zoning Map.

SITE DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 151.145 SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMITS.
   (A)   Purpose. The regulations of this subchapter are intended to accomplish
the following purposes:
      (1)   Meet the requirements of The Rivers, Lakes and Streams Act, 615
ILCS 5/18g;
      (2)   Prevent additional harm due to periodic flooding including loss of
life and property and threats and inconveniences to public health, safety, and
welfare;
      (3)   Assure that new development does not increase flood and drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
      (4)   Create no new financial burden on the taxpayer for flood control
projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities and utilities, and for
flood rescue and relief operations;
      (5)   Protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources;
      (6)   Protect buildings and improvements to buildings from flood damage
to the greatest extent possible;
      (7)   Conserve the natural hydrologic, hydraulic, water quality and other
beneficial functions of flood-prone areas, regulatory floodplains;
      (8)   Prevent additional disruption of the economy and governmental
services due to stormwater and flood drainage;
      (9)   Maintain eligibility for the county in the National Flood Insurance
Program by meeting or exceeding its requirements and thus make federally
subsidized flood insurance available at reduced rates. Comply with the rules
and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R.
parts 59 through 79, as amended; and
      (10)   Conserve the natural hydrologic, hydraulic, water quality and
other beneficial functions of wetlands by having, at a minimum, no net loss of
wetlands in the county, and further these beneficial functions wetlands by
having an objective of a net gain of wetland functions as specified in the
Wetland Preservation and Restoration Plan component of the Lake County
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (B)   Applicability. A site development permit is required for any
development that meets any one of the following criteria:
 
COMMENTARY:
In order to prevent “phasing” of development to circumvent the intent of these
regulations, when a proposed development activity will occur on a lot or parcel of
land that has contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned in whole or in part by the
same property owner, then the criteria as defined in the “Applicability” section
will be applied to the total land area compiled from aggregate ownership parcels.
If this aggregate ownership land area is greater than the minimum area requirements
defined in the “Applicability” section, then a site development permit will be
required.
 
      (1)   Is located on a property containing a regulatory floodplain;
      (2)   Is located in a flood-prone area with 100 acres of tributary
drainage area or more;
      (3)   Is located in a depressional storage area with a surface area of
one-fourth acre or more, or with a storage volume of 0.75 acre-feet or more for
the base flood;
      (4)   Creates a wetland impact within an area defined as waters of the
United States or isolated waters of Lake County;
      (5)   Modifies the flood-prone area of a water body where the tributary
drainage area is 20 or more acres;
      (6)   Includes the total land area of an ownership parcel that results
in:
         (a)   More than one acre of new impervious area; or
         (b)   More than three acres of hydrologically disturbed area, unless
the total new impervious surface area is less than one-half acre; or
         (c)   An impervious surface area ratio of 50% or greater, unless the
total new impervious surface area is less than one-half acre. The term “new”,
as used in this subsection (B)(6), refers to impervious or hydrologically
disturbed area created after the original effective date of the Watershed
Development Ordinance (October 13, 1992). Redevelopment of previously developed
sites shall maintain existing storage volume and shall not increase the rate of
runoff from the site. The applicant shall provide supporting data and
calculations to the satisfaction of the Planning, Building and Development
Director to ensure the site design either provides a watershed benefit or meets
the requirements of §
151.146(C)(2). New development on partially developed sites shall meet the
release rate criteria in §
151.146(C) for the new development, if the new development exceeds the
thresholds in subsections (B)(6)(a), (B)(6)(b), or (B)(6)(c) above.
      (7)   Any site disturbance on any undeveloped parcel, or the undeveloped
portion of any parcel that consists of any of the following:
         (a)   Any excavation, filling, or combination of excavation or filling
that will exceed 500 cubic yards;
         (b)   Any excavation, filling, or combination of excavation or filling
that will exceed three feet in vertical depth or height at its deepest point
measured from the natural ground surface; any excavation, filling, or
combination of excavation or filling that will exceed an area of 1,000 square
feet;
         (c)   Removal of plant cover from an area exceeding 1,000 square feet;
or
         (d)   Any development within an area previously identified by the
county as posing a unique drainage concern. For proposed developments within
those areas, an inspection of the site shall be conducted and the Planning,
Building and Development Director shall determine whether a site development
permit is required based on the site conditions.
      (8)   For all nonresidential development, with the exception of interior
alterations, a site development permit shall be required unless, following an
inspection of the site, the Planning, Building and Development Director
determines that, based on the site conditions, no permit is warranted.
      (9)   Any activity to a building in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) as
described in FEMA publication 480 National Flood Insurance Program Flood
Management Requirements.
   (C)   Exempted development.
      (1)   All development shall comply with minimum federal, state, and local
regulations. No development is exempt from the floodplain, floodway, wetland,
and soil erosion and sediment control provisions of this chapter. An exemption
request under subsection (C)(2) below shall be submitted in writing by the
applicant to the Planning, Building and Development Director for an exemption
from specific performance standards of this chapter. The applicant’s exemption
request shall itemize each chapter provision that is requested for exemption.
After review and verification by the Planning, Building and Development
Director that subsection (C)(2) below is met, the specific chapter provision
exemptions may be granted.
         (a)   Final plats, site development permits, or current building
permits approved prior to October 18, 1992 if the stormwater management
facilities are installed and functioning and in compliance with all applicable
stormwater regulations then in effect. This item is applicable to §
151.146(H)(5) (buffer areas) only.
         (b)   Final plats, planned unit developments, site development permits
or current building permits approved between October 18, 1992 and April 13,
2021, if the approved plans and designs are in conformance with the pre-October
13, 2020, ordinance provisions. That portion of any final plat, planned unit
development, site development permit, or current building permit which is
amended after the effective date of this chapter and which affects the
stormwater management system is not exempt from the provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   Re-subdivision of commercial or industrial subdivisions
identified under subsection (C)(1)(a) above, provided that the stormwater
management facilities are installed and functioning and there is no increase in
impervious surface area permitted. Re-subdivision of commercial or industrial
subdivisions identified under subsection (C)(1)(b) above, provided there is no
increase in impervious surface area beyond that which was originally approved.
         (d)   Public road development on county highways and township roads,
provided that plans will be submitted to the Lake County Stormwater Management
Commission to ensure compliance with applicable stormwater management, soil
erosion and sediment control and floodplain and wetland requirements.
         (e)   The maintenance of existing buildings and facilities such as
resurfacing of roadways when the road elevation is not increased.
      (2)   If eligible under subsections (C)(1)(a), (C)(1)(b), or (C)(1)(c)
above, the applicant may submit a written request to the Planning, Building and
Development Director for an exemption from specific performance standards of
this chapter. The applicant’s exemption request shall itemize each ordinance
provision that is requested for exemption.
      (3)   A site development permit shall not be required for any of the
following:
         (a)   The maintenance of existing buildings and facilities such as
resurfacing of roadways when the road elevation is not increased;
         (b)   Practices associated with local food gardens that do not involve
filling or grading;
         (c)   Fence installation, pole placement, drilling, or other minor
auxiliary construction as long as the development activity is not located in a
regulatory floodway, wetland, or water body.
   (D)   Classification of development. All activities requiring a site
development permit shall be classified as “major” or “minor” developments, in
accordance with the following definitions.
      (1)   Major development. A “major” development is any development subject
to site development permit requirements that meets any one of the following
criteria:
         (a)   Is located in any portion of a regulatory floodway or
floodplain, with compensatory storage requirement, is located in any
depressional storage area that has a surface area of one-fourth acre or more,
or that has a volume larger than 0.75 acre-feet;
         (b)   Creates a wetland impact to waters of the United States or
isolated waters of Lake County exceeding the isolated wetland impact mitigation
thresholds in §
151.146(M)(4);
         (c)   Modifies a water body where the tributary drainage area is
greater than 100 acres, with compensatory storage requirement; or
         (d)   Requires detention per §
151.146(C).
      (2)   Minor development. A “minor” development is any development subject
to site development permit requirements that is not a “major” development,
provided that the Planning, Building and Development Director may classify any
development as a “major” development if that the Planning, Building and
Development Director determines that the nature of the proposed work warrants
the “major” development classification.
   (E)   Review and approval procedure.
      (1)   Relationship to development review procedures of §§
151.045 through
151.058. The “general” procedural requirements and standards of §
151.045 shall apply to the review and approval procedures of this section.
      (2)   Application. Applications for site development permits shall be
made in person in the Planning, Building and Development Department.
      (3)   Staff review and action. Planning, Building and Development
Department staff shall review each site development permit application and,
within 30 days of receipt of a complete application, act to approve, approve
with conditions, or deny the application. Failure of the Planning, Building and
Development Director to act within the 30-day period shall constitute a denial
of the application, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time. If the
applicant fails to provide information requested by the Planning, Building and
Development Director within three months of the request, the application shall
be void, unless the time is extended by the Planning, Building and Development
Director.
      (4)   Other approvals required; permit issuance before final approval.
         (a)   No site development permit shall be issued by the Planning,
Building and Development Director unless the development, including but not
limited to subdivisions and planned unit developments, has been approved by all
applicable county agencies. However, in the following instances, a site
development permit may be issued prior to final approval provided that:
            1.   The final engineering plans are approved by the appropriate
county agencies, and the development demonstrates compliance with applicable
application requirements and performance standards; and
            2.   All applicable application requirements and performance
standards have been met, except for obtaining any required state and federal
approvals.
         (b)   A request for commencement of grading activities may be made for
a development site prior to the issuance of a site development permit. The
proposed grading activity may commence with written approval from the Planning,
Building and Development Director of the earth change approval plan that
delineates the activities specifically allowed including appropriate soil
erosion and sediment control measures. The written approval will be in the form
of a permit. The permit application will state the conditions and limitations
of the proposed grading activities. No permit may be issued and no development
activity may occur in a regulatory floodplain, except for excavations outside
of the regulatory floodway and which do not require an Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources permit, wetland, or in those
portions of the site for which this chapter requires that state and federal
permits be issued, except for Illinois Environmental Protection Agency sewer
and water extension permits. (See
Appendix G for a partial list of agencies from which permits may be required.)
      (5)   Financial assurances.  
         (a)   For nonresidential development that meets the criteria of §
151.145(B)(6) and for any development where the Planning, Building and
Development Director requires, the applicant shall file with the county a
performance assurance satisfactory to the Lake County State’s Attorney for an
amount equal to one 130% of the total cost of improvements including the cost
of landscaping, soil erosion and sediment control measures, and all engineering
costs and inspection fees, based upon the consulting engineer’s estimate of
cost. Government entities such as townships, schools, park districts, and the
like are exempt from this requirement.
         (b)   A maintenance assurance if required by the county, shall be
deposited with the county prior to the release of any performance assurance
held by the county for the time period and in the amount specified by the
Planning, Building and Development Director to cover the cost of failure or
repair of improvements installed on the site, including landscaping, wetland
restoration/mitigation, and soil erosion and sediment control measures.
         (c)   A letter certifying the as-built conditions shall be submitted
by the consulting engineer prior to the release of any performance assurance.
In addition, the Planning, Building and Development Director may require deed
restrictions, covenants, easements, or any other documents to ensure proper
enforcement of the site development regulations.
         (d)   The assurance may be drawn at any time the permittee fails to
comply with the requirements of this or any other county ordinance or with the
approved site development plans or with the approved timeframe for site
development activities.
      (6)   As-built drawings. As-built drawings, signed and sealed by a
Licensed Professional Engineer, shall be required for all major developments,
public road developments, and other types of development as determined by the
Planning. Building and Development Director (such as those developments that
affect stormwater runoff rates or volume, impact wetlands or wetland buffers,
or are adjacent to floodplains). As-built drawings and supporting information
shall clearly show all as-built conditions, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Topographic spot elevations and contours for overland flow
paths, detention ponds, storage facilities, and building pads;
         (b)   Detention pond restrictor size, invert elevation, emergency
overflow size, and elevation;
         (c)   Verification of required native vegetation planted (seed tags,
invoices);
         (d)   Storm sewer sizes, inverts;
         (e)   Drain tile information provided from the Subsurface Drainage
Inventory, or identified during construction as follows: location, connection,
size, material, and inverts for those drain tiles that are part of the
stormwater management system;
         (f)   Other information required under this chapter;
         (g)   Applicable calculations or other information verifying
conformance with the permitted plan set;
         (h)   Low floor and low opening elevations of structures. Low opening
sizes where vents are required; and
         (i)   Benchmark information.
         (j)   Elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member of a lowest floor, and whether the structure has a basement, for
structures located in a coastal high hazard area.
      (7)   Inspections. The Planning, Building and Development Director may
inspect site development at any stage in the construction process. For major
developments, the Planning, Building and Development Director shall conduct
site inspections, at a minimum, at the end of the construction stages (E)(7)
(a)1. through 7. listed below. Construction plans approved by the Planning,
Building and Development Director shall be maintained at the site during
progress of the work. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the
following schedule, the permittee shall notify the Planning, Building and
Development Director at least two full working days before the inspection is to
be made. The Designated Erosion Control Inspector shall conduct inspections and
document as described below, at a minimum, at the intervals in subsections (E)
(7)(a)1. and (E)(7)(a)6. listed below, for those developments that require a
Designated Erosion Control Inspector, until permanent stabilization and
Planning, Building and Development Director approval of appropriate as-built
documentation and drawings.
         (a)   Recommended inspection intervals are listed below:
            1.   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding
with any other earth disturbance or grading;

than one-half inch of rainfall or liquid equivalent precipitation;
            3.   After final stabilization and landscaping, prior to removal of
sediment and erosion controls;
            4.   After removal of erosion and sediment controls;
            5.   Designated Erosion Control Inspector inspections may be
performed at a reduced frequency, at the discretion of the Planning, Building
and Development Director, for projects with a valid Site Development Permit,
that are permanently stabilized, and are entering a prolonged period of
inactivity. Designated Erosion Control inspections shall only be required after
storm events with greater than 0.5 inch of rainfall or liquid equivalent
precipitation.
            6.   If a wetland mitigation area is constructed as part of the
site development permit, the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission or
Isolated Water of Lake County-Certified Community’s Certified Wetland
Specialist shall, at a minimum, perform the following inspections:
               a.    Inspection by a certified wetland specialist after
mitigation areas have been final graded and before seeding or plant
installation;
               b.    Inspection by a certified wetland specialist after seeding
or plant installation; and
               c.   At a minimum, annual inspections by a certified wetland
specialist during the five-year monitoring and maintenance period for wetland
mitigation areas.
         (b)   Minimum inspection documentation shall include: site
observations and a sufficient number of photos depicting the conditions of the
entire site, inspector’s name, date and time of the inspection, status of
perimeter control, and site outlet observations.
      (8)   Special precautions.
         (a)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the
Planning, Building and Development Director determines that the nature of the
site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to
imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure,
the Planning, Building and Development Director may require, as a condition of
allowing the work to be done, that reasonable special precautions be taken as
is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of the peril. “Special
precautions” may include but shall not be limited to a more level exposed
slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing,
compaction, cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and
recommendations of a Licensed Geotechnical Engineer and/or Licensed
Professional Geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
         (b)   Where the Planning, Building and Development Director determines
that storm damage may result or has resulted because the grading on any
development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take any other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Planning, Building
and Development Director may require that the operations be conducted in
specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices
prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
         (c)   In the event that a stormwater detention or conveyance facility
fails to function as designed because of improper or inadequate maintenance,
the Planning, Building and Development Director shall inspect the facility and
compel corrective action. To compel corrective action, the Planning, Building
and Development Director shall provide written notification to the property
owner indicating: (1) corrective actions required to return the facility to
functional order; or (2) additional engineering plans, reports or calculations
required to identify the problem or engineer a solution, and that the plans,
reports, or calculations shall be submitted for review and approval.
      (9)   Permit expiration.
         (a)   A site development permit shall be issued for a time period of
not more than two years and shall expire by limitation. The Planning, Building
and Development Director may grant an extension of time, not to exceed one
year, if the Planning, Building and Development Director determines, based on
information provided by the permit holder, that unusual difficulties have
prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits. A
written extension request and permit extension fee (revised May 9, 2006) must
be filed by a permit holder before expiration of the permit. If the work
authorized by such permit has not been commenced within six months of permit
issuance, the permit shall lapse and be of no further effect unless a start
work extension request has been filed within six months of permit issuance
(revised May 9, 2006). If the permit expires, a new permit application review
and fees shall be required for the completion of the project and the applicant
shall comply with the current ordinance requirements.
         (b)   A permit that includes a structure located within the regulatory
floodplain, or will be located within the regulatory floodplain, shall be
terminated without the possibility of an extension, if the start of
construction is not commenced within 180 days of the permit issuance date
unless the structure is compliant with the following:
            1.   Any modification to National Flood Insurance Program
regulations after permit issuance; or
            2.   Any modification to a Federal Emergency Management Agency
Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study after permit issuance.
         (c)   For the purposes of this subsection, “start of construction”
means the commencement of any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or improvement of a structure; or the first placement of permanent construction
of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
walkways: nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
      (10)   Revocation of permit. In the event any person holding a site
development permit violates the terms of the permit, or conducts or carries on
the site development in a manner that adversely affects the health, welfare, or
safety of persons residing or working in the vicinity of the subject property,
or conducts or carries on the site development in a manner that is materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the vicinity, the Planning, Building and Development Director shall revoke or
suspend the site development permit in accordance with the provisions of §
151.253.
      (11)   Refunds. Refunds of site development application and permit fees
are granted in accordance with the Planning, Building and Development
Department fee refund policy. (County Board approved.)

any stormwater detention facility to be constructed in the subdivision for the
future availability of the highway authority for meeting stormwater detention
requirements of any future public construction on the highway.
   (B)   Runoff calculations.
      (1)   For tributary drainage areas of 100 acres or more in area and for
the determination of detention and depressional storage requirements, a Lake
County Stormwater Management Commission-approved hydrograph-producing runoff
calculation method shall be used.
Appendix J also may be used, when appropriate and upon approval of the
Planning, Building and Development Director, for determination of detention
storage volumes.
      (2)   The Rational Method may be used to calculate discharges for areas
of less than 100 acres. The Rational Method shall not be used to determine
detention or depressional storage requirements.
      (3)   Rainfall data obtained from the Lake County Stormwater Management
Commission (presented in
Appendix K) shall be used for rainfall volume, storm distribution, return
frequency, and event duration.
      (4)   Runoff calculations for all off-site drainage areas shall be based
on anticipated future land use conditions or existing land use conditions,
whichever yields the greater runoff. Anticipated future land use conditions
will be based on future land use and existing storage facilities. Future
detention facilities may be used for anticipated future land use conditions if
approved by the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission Chief Engineer or,
for tributary drainage areas less than 100 acres if approved by the Planning,
Building and Development Director. Existing land use conditions will be based
on existing land use and existing storage facilities. For each frequency storm
event, runoff calculations will be based on the critical duration, for all
durations presented in
Appendix K.
      (5)   Existing depressional storage volume shall be maintained and the
volume of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this chapter
shall be in addition to the existing storage.
      (6)   For determination of soil runoff characteristics, areas of the
development that are hydrologically disturbed and compacted shall be changed to
the next higher hydrologic soil classification e.g., B to C, C to D, or as
approved by the Planning, Building and Development Director. Soil groups that
are not hydrologically disturbed will retain their current runoff
characteristics.
      (7)   Areas that are deed or plat restricted for native planting areas
may be determined to have lower runoff characteristics, and may be taken into
account when meeting the runoff volume reduction requirements of this chapter.
The Planning, Building and Development Director may determine these areas can
be excluded from the required detention volume calculation.
   (C)   Release rates and discharges.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified in a county-adopted basin plan,
floodplain study, or
Appendix L, the detention volume required shall be calculated using a rating
curve based on maximum release rates of 0.04 cubic feet per second, per acre
for the two-year, 24-hour storm event, nor 0.15 cubic feet per second, per acre
for the 100-year, 24-hour storm event. The release rate requirements shall
apply to the hydrologically disturbed area of the ownership parcel unless the
Planning, Building and Development Director determines that specific locations
of the ownership parcel have unique circumstances such that the release rate
shall apply to a broader or smaller area. The release rate requirements shall
only apply to the developments listed in §
151.145(B)(6).
      (2)   All concentrated stormwater discharges must be conveyed into a
maintainable outlet with adequate downstream stormwater capacity (as defined in
§
151.271) and will not result in increased flood and drainage hazard. An
existing channel, storm sewer or overland flow path is said to have adequate
downstream capacity when it can be shown to accommodate up to and including the
100-year stormwater runoff without increasing property damage to the adjacent
property or to a point downstream known to be a restriction causing significant
backwater.
      (3)   The design of stormwater drainage systems shall not result in the
interbasin transfer of drainage, unless no reasonably feasible alternative
exists. The Planning, Building and Development Director may also allow
interbasin transfer if the transfer relieves a known drainage hazard and there
is adequate downstream stormwater capacity.
      (4)   There shall be a minimum of one foot of freeboard above the base
flood elevation on all detention/retention basins.
      (5)   Watershed-specific release rates are tabulated in
Appendix L.
      (6)   The combined release from the detention facility outlet and the
outlet designed to meet wetland hydrology requirements of subsection (M)(7)
shall not exceed either the two- or 100-year allowable release rates,
respectively. The wetland hydrology requirement or minimum outlet restrictor
size may take precedence over the allowed release rate, provided there is
adequate downstream capacity as determined by the Planning, Building and
Development Director.
      (7)   The applicant shall prohibit illicit discharges generated during
the development process from entering into the stormwater management system.
Discharges of stormwater from a development site shall be in conformance with
the soil erosion and sediment control practices contained in §§
151.145 through
151.154 of this chapter.
   (D)   Runoff volume reduction (RVR).
      (1)   Applicants shall choose a strategies that minimize stormwater
runoff volumes and addresses water quality impairments. The site development
plan shall incorporate stormwater infiltration, evapotranspiration, reuse, or
other methods, into the project. The applicant shall use appropriate green
infrastructure techniques and best management practices to reduce runoff
volume, according to the following hierarchy, in order of preference, in
preparing a stormwater management plan:
         (a)   Preservation and enforcement of the stormwater management
benefits of the natural resource features of the development site (e.g., areas
of Hydrologic Soil Groups A and B, floodplains, waters of the United States,

woodlands);
         (b)   Minimization or disconnection of impervious surfaces;
         (c)   Enhancement of the infiltration and storage characteristics of
the development site using appropriate best management practices;
         (d)   The use of open channels with native vegetation to convey

rainwater harvesting practices;
         (g)   Measures that provide water quality and quantity control; and
         (h)   Measures that provide only quantity control.
      (2)   (a)   Runoff volume reduction (RVR), Quantitative Standard. The
minimum RVR quantitative standard shall be the volume achieved utilizing
applicable RVR Credits, as determined by the applicant and approved by the
Planning, Building and Development Director, based on the maximum extent
practicable, for the following development. The term “new” for the RVR
Quantitative Standard refers to impervious surface created after April 1, 2009.
         (b)   Minor and Major Development that result in at least one acre
hydrologic disturbance and more than 0.5 acre of new impervious surface area;

shall be determined by using the appropriate release rates specified in
subsection (C) regardless of a minimum outlet restrictor size;
      (4)   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall operate automatically. They will be designed to limit discharges into
existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed
predetermined safe capacities and not in excess of flows which would have
occurred with the land in its natural, undeveloped condition.
      (5)   The approach slopes of the basin shall conform as closely as
possible to natural land contours. Regrading is preferable if necessary to keep

COMMENTARY:
Best management practices are presented in the Lake County Stormwater
Management Commission’s Technical Reference Manual.
 
      (9)   For basins designed without permanent pools (dry bottom type),
provisions must be incorporated to facilitate interior drainage, to include
positive grades to outlet structures (bottom of basins must be a minimum of 2%
grade), longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage facilities, or
the installation of sub-surface drains. Wherever practical the interior
drainage shall be provided over non-erosive vegetative surfaces. When
vegetation cannot be established, a rip-rap or concrete swale or underdrain
shall be provided from the inlet structure to the outlet structure. Multi-
purpose features may be designed as part of dry bottom detention facilities;
however, the features must be designed to serve only secondary purposes for
recreation, open space, or other uses which will not be adversely affected by
occasional or intermittent flooding;
      (10)   For basins designed with permanent pools (wet bottom type):
         (a)   The minimum normal depth of water before the introduction of
excess stormwater shall be four feet;
         (b)   If fish are stocked, at least one-fourth of the area of the
permanent pool must have a minimum depth of 12 feet;
         (c)   For emergency purposes, cleaning or shoreline/buffer
maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for the use of
auxiliary equipment to permit emptying and drainage;
         (d)   Approach slopes shall be at least 6:1 but not more than 3:1 and
shall be at least four feet wide and shall slope towards the basin. A minimum
eight-foot wide safety shelf with a maximum depth of three feet below normal
water level sloped back towards the shoreline. The side slopes shall be of non-
eroding material with a slope of 1:1 or less. Alternate designs for side slopes
may be considered under special circumstances and when approved by the
Planning, Building and Development Director; and
         (e)   Sediment storage shall be provided in all detention/retention
basins. The amount of sediment storage capacity shall be determined by the
Planning, Building and Development Director based on size of the development,
soil types, construction methods, basin design, and other relevant factors.
      (11)   For basins designed as a wetland type basin, provisions must be
incorporated to facilitate interior drainage, to include positive grades to
outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage
facilities, or the installation of sub-surface drains. A basin plan shall be
prepared for the establishment and maintenance of the wetland vegetation.
Multi-purpose features may be designed as part of dry bottom detention
facilities; however, the features must be designed to serve only secondary
purposes for recreation, open space, or other uses which will not be adversely
affected by occasional or intermittent flooding;
      (12)   Detention storage may be met in total or in part by detention on
flat roofs. Details of designs to be included in the building permit
application shall include the depth and volume of storage, details of outlet
devices and downdrains, elevation of overflow scuppers, design loadings for the
roof structure and emergency overflow provisions. Direct connection of roof
drains to sanitary sewers is prohibited;
      (13)   Paved parking lots may be designed to provide temporary detention
storage of stormwater on all or a portion of their surfaces. Outlets will be
designed so as to slowly empty the stored waters, and the depth of storage must
be limited to not greater than six inches so as to prevent damage to parked
vehicles;
      (14)   All or a portion of the required detention storage may be provided
in underground facilities with the approval of the Planning, Building and
Development Director. No detention storage may be provided in or under the
ultimate right-of-way of any public road;
      (15)   On-stream detention.
         (a)   All on-stream detention shall provide a Detention Volume Safety
Factor as follows:
            1.   The Detention Volume Safety Factor is applied to the volume of
on-stream detention necessary to meet the Watershed Development Ordinance site
requirements.
            2.   The Detention Volume Safety Factor is equal to one plus 0.05
times the ratio of off-site tributary area to on-site tributary area.
            3.   The maximum Detention Volume Safety Factor shall be 1.5.
         (b)   No on-stream detention shall be allowed with an off-site to on-
site tributary area greater than 10:1 except for development providing a
watershed benefit.
         (c)   On-stream detention shall not be permissible if the tributary
drainage area is greater than 640 acres except for detention that provides a
watershed benefit.
         (d)   The release rate shall be 0.04 cubic feet per second per acre of
the total tributary (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by
impoundment of the on-site two-year storm volume plus the Detention Volume
Safety Factor, and 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary
area (on-site and off-site) at the elevation created by impoundment of the on-
site 100-year storm volume plus the Detention Volume Safety Factor. The release
rate shall be calculated using the 24-hour storm event. This release rate
calculation shall be used unless other site conditions warrant further analysis
and modification from this standard or unless watershed specific release rates
have been adopted as listed in
Appendix L.
         (e)   On-stream detention shall provide water quality treatment. One
of the following two methods shall be used:
            1.   A wet detention facility with a minimum permanent pool volume
equal to the calculated sediment volume accumulated over a one-year period for
the entire upstream watershed and an average normal water depth of at least
four feet. The facility shall also have a live storage volume that, at a
minimum, equals the water quality treatment standards of subsection (H)(4) for
the development site; or
            2.   A separate off-line siltation basin with a volume meeting the
water quality treatment standards of subsection (H)(4) for the tributary
drainage area to the sediment basin.
         (f)   Impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention shall
be designed to allow the migration and movement of present or potentially
present indigenous species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle. The impoundment shall not cause or contribute to the
degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat.
         (g)   Compensatory storage require-ments shall be satisfied.
         (h)   No on-stream detention shall be allowed in areas designated as
an exceptional functional value wetland.

the Planning, Building and Development Director.
            3.   Fee-in-lieu of on-site stormwater storage shall be the lesser
of:
               A.   The fee computed for each acre-foot or cubic yard or part
thereof of stormwater storage; or
               B.   The estimated construction cost of the applicant’s proposed

for maintenance and emergency ingress and egress capability.
   (F)   Existing stormwater facilities.
      (1)   Existing lakes, ponds or stormwater basins may be utilized to
provide for the stormwater detention required by this section, provided that
the storage capacity of the existing basin and its ability to function to
provide for the intent of the regulations of this section shall be verified to
the satisfaction of the Planning, Building and Development Director. In these
cases, the existing basin shall comply with all of the design and engineering
standards for new stormwater basins, as established in subsection (E), except
when the Planning, Building and Development Director finds that the
modification of the existing basin to comply with the standards of this section
would not be practical nor desirable, and provided that the deviation from the
standards of this section will not serve to compromise the overall intent of
this section.
      (2)   Wetlands may be utilized to provide for the stormwater detention
required by this section, provided that the existing depressional storage
volume of the wetland is maintained and that the volume of detention storage
provided to meet the requirements of this section is in addition to the
existing storage volume. The use of wetlands for stormwater detention purposes
is subject to the following standards.
         (a)   If the wetland will be excavated or if the proposed outlet
structure elevation is set above the existing normal water elevation of the
wetland, the proposed basin shall comply with all of the design and engineering
standards for new stormwater basins established in subsection (E) (except when
the Planning, Building and Development Director finds that the modification of
the wetland to comply with the standards of this section would not be practical
nor desirable, and provided that the deviation from the standards of this
section will not serve to compromise the overall intent of this section). The
use of wetlands for stormwater detention purposes may require U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers approval (see subsection (M)(1) below).
         (b)   If the wetland will not be excavated and if the proposed outlet
structure elevation is set at the existing normal water elevation of the
wetland, the proposed basin shall not be required to comply with the design and
engineering standards for new stormwater basins, as established in subsection
(E) above. The use of wetlands in this manner may require U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers approval.
         (c)   A management plan for maintaining the existing storage volume
shall be prepared.
   (G)   Joint development/use of stormwater management facilities.
      (1)   Stormwater management facilities may be planned in coordination by
two or more developments or land owners as long as flood and/or stormwater
hazards are not increased at intervening locations, and shall be encouraged by
the county wherever feasible. In these cases, a maintenance agreement, approved
by the Planning, Building and Development Director, shall be established
between the developments or land owners and recorded with the Lake County
Recorder (see subsection (I) below).
      (2)   In the event that an existing stormwater management facility is, in
whole or in part, under the sole and exclusive control of a separate individual
or governmental agency, the Planning, Building and Development Director shall
not permit the use of the existing facility unless the individual or
governmental agency having the sole and exclusive control grants its permission
for the use of the existing facility. Permission granting the use of the
stormwater management facility shall be in writing and must be presented to the
Planning, Building and Development Director.
   (H)   Stormwater conveyance systems.
      (1)   Storm sewers and swales.
         (a)   The ten-year design storm shall be used as a minimum for the
design of storm sewers, swales, and appurtenances. Storm sewers shall have a
minimum diameter of 12 inches, with the exception that storm sewers servicing a
single parcel may be excused from this requirement upon approval of the
Planning, Building and Development Director. Storm sewer design analysis shall
be calculated under full flow conditions, unless prior approval from the
Planning, Building and Development Director is received for an alternate flow
condition (e.g., pressure flow).
         (b)   The development shall not connect to sanitary sewers or to
existing agricultural stormwater management systems (tiles) as an outflow for
the stormwater management system. Field tile systems disturbed during the
process of land development must be reconnected by those responsible for their
disturbance unless the approved drainage plan includes provisions for their
relocation.
         (c)   All storm sewers shall be located in a public road right-of-way
or drainage easement of sufficient size to maintain or reconstruct the sewer. A
covenant, running with the land, shall be recorded with the easements
describing the maintenance responsibilities in the easements (see subsection
(I) below). Prior to the construction of any storm sewer within an existing
public road right-of-way, written permission must be obtained from the highway
authority having jurisdiction over the right-of-way.
         (d)   All on-site stormwater management systems shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from all events up to
the base flood without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion shall
be provided at the inlets and outlets of all pipe transitions and paved
channels.
         (e)   All swales utilized as part of the stormwater management system
for a development shall be located within a deed-restricted or plat-restricted
area of sufficient size to maintain or reconstruct the swale.
         (f)   All swales must be a minimum 2% grade unless the Planning,
Building and Development Director determines that the existing site conditions
will prohibit that grade.
         (g)   Surface outflows onto adjoining properties shall be designed to
release as sheet flow using level spreader trenches unless alternative designs
are approved by the Planning, Building and Development Director.
         (h)   For agricultural drain tiles (tiles) the following provisions
shall apply.
            1.   Field tile systems disturbed during the process of development
shall be reconnected by those responsible for their disturbance unless the
approved drainage plan includes provisions for these.
            2.   Observation structures, or similar maintenance and inspection
access structures, shall be installed within the development at the suitable
points of ingress and egress.
            3.   The applicant shall notify adjoining downstream property
owners in writing of any proposed stormwater facility outlet location and
design. The development design shall utilize, where practical and approved by
the Planning, Building and Development Director, outflow locations that have an
existing tile leaving the development site. A subsurface connection to the tile
shall be constructed as a low flow outlet. A surface outlet shall be designed
for the development site outflows based on the assumption the downstream tile
will cease to function.
            4.   Drain tiles within the disturbed portions of the ownership
parcel shall be replaced or intercepted and connected into the proposed
stormwater management system or a bypass. The system or bypass shall be of an
equivalent size.
            5.   Drain tiles located within an ownership parcel may be removed
or disabled provided that a maintainable outlet exists or is installed to
prevent flood damages to off-site properties.
            6.   If the development stormwater management system depends on
existing drain tiles for stormwater conveyance or water surface elevation
control, a maintainable outlet is required.
            7.   The locations for existing drain tiles within the ownership
parcel shall be defined using the Subsurface Drainage Inventory. Recorded deed
or plat restrictions shall be provided for all existing and replaced drain
tiles within the ownership parcel which are part of the stormwater management
system. Drain tiles that service a single parcel of property may be excused
from this requirement upon approval of the Planning. Building and Development
Director.
            8.   The maintenance plan per §
151.145(F)(2)(f)3. shall include the type and frequency of maintenance for all
existing and replaced drain tiles within the ownership parcel which are part of
the stormwater management system.
      (2)   Sump pump and drain tile discharges.
         (a)   The connection of sump pumps, roof drain tile systems or any
other new drain tile line, or the discharge of groundwater or stormwater into
sanitary sewers shall not be permitted.
         (b)   Sump pumps, roof drain tile systems or any other new drain tile
line shall discharge into any channel that has adequate downstream capacity,
other than the open drainage system (e.g., a roadside ditch) of a public road
right-of-way. When there exists no channel with adequate downstream capacity,
other than the open drainage system of a public road right-of-way, sump pumps,
roof drain tile systems, or any other new drain tile line may discharge into
the open drainage system of a public road right-of-way. When existing
conditions permit, however, the discharge point shall be no closer than 20 feet
from the road right-of-way and water from the discharge point shall flow to the
right-of-way via a non-channelized, non-erosive, non-impervious surface (i.e.,
sheet flow over grass). The discharge from a sump pump, roof drain tile system,
or any other new drain tile line shall be conveyed in a manner which does not
impact adjoining property owners.
         (c)   The direct connection of sump pumps, roof drain tile systems, or
any other new drain tile line into a closed drainage system (e.g., a storm
sewer), designed to accommodate the stormwater or groundwater discharges, is
encouraged within new developments. The connection of sump pumps, roof drain
tile systems, or any other new drain tile line into an existing closed drainage
system shall only be permitted when the ability of the existing drainage system
to accommodate the stormwater or groundwater discharges is verified by the
applicant.
      (3)   Overland flow paths.
         (a)   Generally. All areas of development must provide an overland
flow path that will pass the base flood flow without damage to structures or
property. If the upstream drainage area is less than 20 acres, a storm sewer
pipe and inlet systems sized for the base flood can be constructed in lieu of
providing an overland flow path.
         (b)   Flow rate. The flow rate for the base flood shall establish
overland flow path limits, and it shall include all on-site and off-site
tributary areas in accordance with subsection (B) above.
         (c)   Deed of plat - restricted area. All proposed overland flow paths
shall be located within a deed-restricted or plat-restricted area of sufficient
size to maintain or reconstruct the overland flow path. The overland flow path
shall be protected from any activity, such as fencing, landscaping, or storage
shed placement, which could impair its function. This protection shall be
established through a properly recorded deed or plat restriction.
         (d)   Less than 20 acres. For overland flow paths with less than 20
acres tributary area, all structures on a parcel containing or adjoining to an
overland flow path or other high water level designation shall have a lowest
adjacent grade a minimum of one-half foot above the design high water.
         (e)   Over 20 acres.  For overland flow paths with greater than or
equal to 20 acres tributary drainage area but less than 100 acres, all
structures on parcels containing or adjoining to an overland flow path or other
high water level designation shall have a lowest adjacent grade a minimum of
one foot above the design high water elevation.
         (f)   Public health protection.
            1.   No development in or adjacent to an overland flow path shall
include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal
wastes, fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic
materials below one foot above the design high water elevation of the overland
flow path.
            2.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, and sanitary
sewer lines may be permitted providing all manholes or other above-ground
openings located below the design high water elevation of the overland flow
path are watertight.
            3.   On-site individual sewage disposal systems in or adjacent to
an overland flow path shall be designed to avoid inundation by the base flood.
      (4)   Water quality treatment. Water quality treatment standards can be
achieved by combining the Runoff Volume Reduction requirements in subsection
(D) above and the following requirements. The following water quality
requirements apply to developments that result in at least 0.5 acre of new
impervious surface area, where “new” is defined in §
151.145(B)(6). The volume of runoff kept on-site to meet the Runoff Volume
Reduction requirements of this chapter (subsection (D)(1) above) may be
deducted from the required water quality treatment volume.
 
COMMENTARY:
Best management practices are presented in the Lake County Stormwater
Management Commission’s Technical Reference Manual.
 
         (a)   Prior to discharging to waters of the United States, isolated
waters of Lake County or adjoining property, development shall divert and
detain at least the first 0.01 inch of runoff for every 1% of impervious
surface for the “development with a minimum volume equal to 0.2 inches of
runoff (e.g., 20% or less impervious = 0.2, 50% impervious = 0.5, 90%
impervious = 0.9); or provide a similar level of treatment of runoff as
approved by the Planning, Building and Development Director and consistent with
best management practices.
         (b)   Where practical, stormwater shall discharge into the buffer area
of a wetland, or water body rather than directly into the wetland, lake, or
pond. The discharges shall enter the buffer as unconcentrated flow with
appropriate energy dissipation measures to prevent erosion.
         (c)   A buffer shall be established between design normal and high
water levels around stormwater management facilities constructed for water
quality treatment to enhance treatment effectiveness. The buffer area planting
plan shall use the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in
Northeastern Illinois, NRCS, et al., (as amended) as a minimum standard.
         (d)   Hydrocarbon (e.g., oil and grease) removal technology shall be
required using a volume of one-half inch of runoff for the new impervious
surface tributary area to each treatment device and meeting a minimum 70%
removal rate for all development classified as follows:
            1.   Vehicle fueling and servicing facilities; and
            2.   Parking lots with more than 25 new stalls.
      (5)   Buffer areas.
         (a)   Buffer areas shall be required for all areas defined as either
“waters of the United States” or “isolated waters of Lake County”. Buffer areas
are divided into two types, linear buffers and water body buffers.
            1.   Linear buffers shall be designated along both sides of all
linear water bodies meeting the definition of “waters of the United States”.
               a.   When the linear water body has a watershed greater than 20
acres but less than one square mile, the minimum buffer width shall be 50 feet
on each side of the linear water body.
               b.   When the linear water body has a watershed greater than one
square mile, the minimum buffer width shall be 30 feet on each side of the
linear water body.
               c.   Linear exceptional functional value wetlands and streams
with an Index of Biotic Integrity greater than 40 shall have a minimum buffer
width of 100 feet on each side of the linear water body. (Initial IBI based on
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency’s Illinois Water Quality Report,
biannual. A site specific IBI assessment may override this report.)
            2.   Water body buffers shall encompass all nonlinear bodies of
water meeting the definition of either waters of the United States or isolated
waters of Lake County. The buffer width shall be determined as follows:
               a.   For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area
greater than one-third acre but less than one acre, a minimum buffer width of
30 feet shall be established;
               b.   For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area
greater than or equal to one acre but less than two and one–half acres, a
minimum buffer width of 40 feet shall be established; and
               c.   For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area
greater than or equal to two and one-half acres, a minimum buffer width of 50
feet shall be established.
            3.   A buffer shall be established between design normal and high
water levels around stormwater management facilities constructed for water
quality treatment to enhance treatment effectiveness. The buffer area planting
plan shall use the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in
Northeastern Illinois, NRCS, et al. (as amended) as a minimum standard.
         (b)   Nonlinear high-quality aquatic resources shall have a minimum
buffer width of 100 feet.
         (c)   Areas having state or federal threatened and endangered species
present or for Illinois Natural Area Inventory Sites, buffer widths may be
modified upon approval of the Planning, Building and Development Director, to
meet the terms and conditions specified during consultation with the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources or United States Fish and Wildlife Service
pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations.
         (d)   The buffer area for all water bodies meeting the definition of
waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County shall extend from
the ordinary high water mark. The buffer area for wetlands shall extend from
the edge of the delineated wetland. A property may contain a buffer area that
originates from waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County
on another property.
         (e)   Features of the stormwater management system approved by the
Planning, Building and Development Director may be within the buffer area of a
development.
         (f)   Access through buffer areas shall be provided, when necessary,
for maintenance purposes.
         (g)   All roadside drainage ditches, and excavated detention
facilities in existence on August 10, 1999, borrow pits, quarries, and
improvements to existing public road developments or alignments are exempt from
buffer requirements.
         (h)   Stormwater discharges that enter a buffer shall have appropriate
energy dissipation measure to prevent erosion and scour.
         (i)   All buffer areas shall be maintained free from development
including disturbance of the soil, dumping or filling, erection of structures
and placement of impervious surfaces except as follows.
            1.   A buffer area may be used for passive recreation (e.g.,
birdwatching, walking, jogging, bicycling, horseback riding and picnicking) and
it may contain pedestrian, bicycle, or equestrian trails.
            2.   Structures and impervious surfaces (including trails, paths)
may occupy a maximum of 20% of the buffer area, provided the runoff from the
facilities is diverted away from the waters of the United States or Isolated
Waters of Lake county or the runoff is directed to enter the buffer area as
unconcentrated flow.
            3.   Utility maintenance, construction of stormwater facilities,
and maintenance of stormwater facilities shall be allowed.
            4.   Boat docks, boathouses, and piers may be allowed and the
provisions of subsection (H)(5)(i)2. above shall not apply.
            5.   Buffer areas hydrologically disturbed by allowed construction
or as part of a re-vegetation plan shall be re-vegetated using the Native Plant
Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern Illinois, NRCS et
al. (as amended), as a minimum standard.
         (j)   A minimum of a one-foot temporary construction buffer from the
limits of the waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County
shall be required unless the adjacent wetland is considered impacted or
enhanced. The one-foot temporary construction buffer shall be marked by
construction fencing (Illinois Department of Transportation Standard) and
installed prior to the start of all other construction activities. All other
construction activities, including soil erosion and sediment control features,
shall take place on the non-wetland side of the construction fencing.
         (k)   Buffer averaging: the buffer width for a development site may be
varied to a minimum of one-half of the buffer width required, upon approval of
the Planning, Building and Development Director, provided that the total buffer
area required is achieved adjacent to the waters of the United States or
isolated waters of Lake County being buffered. The consultation process of the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may
override the ability to average buffer areas upon approval of the Planning,
Building and Development Director.
         (l)   Preservation of buffer areas shall be provided by deed or plat
restriction.
         (m)   The buffer area of a development site may be subtracted from the
water quality volume required.
      (6)   Linear water bodies.
         (a)   Linear water bodies are to be conserved (see §
151.071(G)).
         (b)   Appropriate uses:
            1.   For linear water bodies with a tributary drainage area of less
than 20 acres, the establishment of any use permitted by the underlying zoning
district is permitted in the linear water body, provided that provisions are
made to pass the base flood flow without damage to structures or property.
            2.   For linear water bodies with a tributary drainage area of 20
acres or more, only the construction, modification, repair, or replacement of
the uses listed below will be allowed in the linear water body, and provided
that the uses will not cause an increase in flood heights for all flood events
up to and including the base flood. The placement of any new structures, fill,
building additions, fencing (including landscaping or plantings designed to act
as a fence), and storage of materials is not permitted in the linear water body
except as specifically permitted for the following uses:
               a.   Public flood control structures and private improvements
relating to the control of drainage and flooding of existing buildings,
erosion, water quality, or habitat for fish and wildlife;
               b.   Structures or facilities relating to functionally water
dependent uses such as facilities and improvements relating to recreational
boating, and as modifications or additions to existing wastewater treatment
facilities;
               c.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
               d.   Underground and overhead utilities if sufficiently flood-
proofed;
               e.   Bridges, culverts, and associated roadways, sidewalks, and
railways, necessary for crossing over the linear water body; and
               f.   Linear water body regrading, without fill, to create a
positive non-erosive slope toward a linear water body.
         (c)   Linear water body modification:
            1.   All development or modification of a linear water body with a
tributary drainage area of 640 acres or more is subject to compliance with the
standards for regulatory floodway development contained in §
151.147. All development or modification of a linear water body with a
tributary drainage area of 100 acres or more is subject to compliance with the
standards for flood-prone area development contained in §
151.147.
            2.   All linear water body modification is subject to compliance
with the following standards.
               a.   Stormwater velocities at the discharge point of a modified
linear water body shall not exceed those of the existing linear water body at
the same point.
               b.   If a stream or linear water body meeting the definition of
waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County is modified, a
stream or linear water body mitigation plan shall be submitted for review and
approval to the Planning, Building and Development Director. The plan shall
show how the physical characteristics of the modified linear water body shall,
at a minimum, meet the existing linear water body in length, cross-section,
slope, sinuosity, and carrying capacity of the original linear water body. The
plan shall also reestablish vegetation within the stream and overbanks using
the Native Plant Guide for Streams and Stormwater Facilities in Northeastern
Illinois, NRCS, et al. (as amended), as a minimum standard for the re-
vegetation plan.
               c.   All disturbed areas associated with a linear water body
modification, including the buffer or setback area, shall be seeded or
otherwise stabilized in accordance with subsection (J) below.
               d.   Prior to the commence-ment of linear water body
modification, an approved and effective means to reduce sedimentation and
degradation of downstream water quality shall be installed. The measures and
practices utilized to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality shall be maintained throughout the construction period.
               e.   New or relocated linear water bodies shall be built in the
dry. All items of construction, including vegetation, shall be completed prior
to diversion of water into the new linear water body.
               f.   New or relocated linear water bodies with a tributary
drainage area of 20 acres or more shall be built no closer than 30 feet to the
ultimate rights-of-way of any public collectors, arterials, or freeways;
buildings; structures or other impervious surface areas (e.g., driveways and
parking areas) except when the Planning, Building and Development Director
finds that existing conditions, such as the exceptional narrowness of a platted
lot, will prohibit the reasonable use of a property if the 30-foot setback is
imposed. The buffer requirements of subsection (H)(5) above shall also be met.
In no event shall relocated water bodies be located closer than ten feet to the
ultimate right-of-way of public roads.
               g.   Linear water bodies shall be expected to withstand all
flood events up to the base flood without increased erosion. The use of
armoring of banks using bulkheads, rip-rap and other materials shall be
avoided. Armoring shall only be used where erosion cannot be prevented in any
other way such as use of vegetation or gradual slopes. The armoring shall have
minimal impact on other properties, linear water bodies, and the existing land
configuration.
               h.   All new or relocated linear water bodies shall be located
within a drainage easement. For new or relocated linear water bodies draining
20 or more acres, the drainage easement shall extend at least 12 feet from top
of bank along at least one side of the linear water body. All drainage
easements shall be accessible to vehicular equipment. No drainage easement
shall be on or within the ultimate right-of-way of any public road.
               i.   Construction vehicles shall cross linear water bodies by
means of existing bridges or culverts. Where an existing crossing is not
available, a temporary crossing shall be constructed that complies with all of
the following standards:
                  (i)   The approach roads will be six inches or less above
natural grade;
                  (ii)   The crossing will allow linear water body flow to pass
without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any
drainage tile or outfall;
                  (iii)   The top of the roadway fill in the linear water body
will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the
linear water body shall be non-erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel;
                  (iv)   All disturbed linear water body banks will be seeded
or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible, in accordance with subsection (J),
upon installation and again upon removal of construction; and
                  (v)   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed
within one year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by
the Planning, Building and Development Director.
         (d)   1.   All proposed public road rights-of-way, buildings,
structures, driveways, and parking areas shall be set back at least 30 feet
from the ordinary high water mark with a tributary drainage area of 20 acres or
more except for the following:
               a.   Fences that are a maximum of four feet in height and that
are at least 50% open (e.g., chain link, split rail, picket, and the like) in
subdivisions approved prior to October 12, 1992, are exempt from setback
requirements. (Note: fences may begin at the shoreline.);
               b.   The setback for decks shall not be less than 20 feet in
subdivisions approved prior to October 12, 1992; and
               c.   The Planning, Building and Development Director shall be
authorized to reduce these required setbacks when it is determined that
existing conditions, such as the exceptional narrowness of a platted lot, will
prohibit the reasonable use of the property if the setback is imposed. The
determinations shall be reported to the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
in accordance with the provisions of §
151.032(A)(16).
            2.   The buffer requirements of subsection (H)(5) above shall also
be met for all subdivisions approved after August 1999.
         (e)   Public health protection standards:
            1.   No development in a linear water body shall include locating
or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes,
fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic
materials below the flood protection elevation.
            2.   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, and sanitary
sewer lines may be permitted, providing all manholes or other above-ground
openings located below the flood protection elevation are watertight.
            3.   On-site individual sewage disposal systems shall be designed
to avoid inundation by the base flood.
   (I)   Maintenance of stormwater management systems. All improvements
required by this section shall be maintained in perpetuity and cannot be
developed for any other use which would limit or cause to limit the intended
function and/or use of the improvements. To ensure continued maintenance of all
stormwater management systems all development shall comply with the following
standards.
      (1)   For new developments not involving a plat of subdivision or plat of
condominium, but for which the provisions of this section are applicable,
maintenance responsibilities assigned by this section shall be those of the
property owner. In these cases, a covenant approved by the Planning, Building
and Development Director providing for perpetual maintenance of required
facilities shall be recorded with the Lake County Recorder prior to issuance of
any certificate of occupancy for the development.
      (2)   For new developments that involve a plat of subdivision or plat of
condominium, a property owners’ association or condominium association shall be
formed in perpetuity for the maintenance of the improvements required by this
section. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for all owners.
Articles of agreement of and providing for the association must be approved by
the Planning, Building and Development Director before recording of a plat.
Furthermore, the association shall be chartered by this state prior to the
release of any final maintenance guarantee held by the county for the relevant
development.
      (3)   Improvements required by this section shall be maintained by the
association of the development and each owner shall bear his or her
proportionate responsibility for continued maintenance. A special note shall
appear on any final plat of subdivision or any plat of condominium and their
declarations.
      (4)   However, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of
all improvements until the time that 80% of the lots or units in the
development have been sold. The developer shall not transfer these improvements
for the purpose of maintenance until all maintenance assurances held for
required improvements have been released by the county.
      (5)   In new residential developments consisting of five or fewer
dwelling units, the provision of an association may be waived, provided that
other parts of this section have been met, and that covenants providing for
shared maintenance responsibilities have been approved by the Planning,
Building and Development Director and recorded with the Lake County Recorder.
   (J)   Soil erosion and sediment control. Soil erosion and sediment control
related measures are required to be constructed and maintained for any
regulated land disturbance activity, in accordance with the standards of this
section. All temporary measures and permanent erosion and sediment control
shall be maintained continuously in an effective, working condition.
      (1)   Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize
erosion. Areas of the development site that are not to be graded shall be
protected from construction traffic or other disturbance until final seeding is
performed. Soil stabilization shall consider the time of year, site conditions,
and the use of temporary or permanent measures.
      (2)   Properties and linear and nonlinear water bodies adjoining
development sites shall be protected from erosion and sedimentation. At points
where concentrated flow leaves a development site, energy dissipation devices
shall be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall
channel as necessary to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow from the
structure to the watercourse so that the natural physical and biological
characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
      (3)   Sediment control measures shall be constructed prior to the
commencement of hydrologic disturbance of upland areas.
      (4)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within seven calendar days following the end of active hydrologic
disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria or using
an appropriate measure as approved by the Planning, Building and Development
Director:
         (a)   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or non-vegetative measures.
         (b)   Disturbance to areas or embankments having slopes equal to or
steeper than 3H:1V shall be minimized; disturbed slopes shall be stabilized
with staked-in-place sod, appropriately specified mat, or blanket, or other
appropriate measure(s) in combination with seeding.
         (c)   Erosion control blanket shall be required on all interior
detention basin side slopes between normal water level and high water level.
The seven calendar day stabilization requirement may be precluded by snow cover
or where land disturbing activities will resume within 14 calendar days from
when the active hydrologic disturbance ceased, provided that the disturbed
portion of the development site has appropriate erosion and sediment controls.
      (5)   Land disturbance activities in streams shall be avoided, where
possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following requirements
shall be met:
         (a)   Where stream construction crossings are necessary, temporary
crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive material; and
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of a stream shall be kept to a
minimum. The stream, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within 48
hours after channel disturbance is completed or interrupted.
      (6)   Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be appropriate
with regard to the amount of tributary area to the measure as follows.
         (a)   Disturbed areas draining greater than 1,000 square feet but less
than one acre shall, at
a minimum, be protected by a filter barrier (including filter fences, which at
a minimum, meet the applicable sections of the AASHTO Standard Specification to
288-00, or equivalent control measures) to control all off-site runoff.
Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, in the direction of
flow, may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
         (b)   Disturbed areas draining more than one but fewer than five acres
shall, at a minimum, be protected by a sediment trap or equivalent control
measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (c)   Disturbed areas draining more than five acres, shall, at a
minimum, be protected by a sediment basin with a perforated filtered riser pipe
or equivalent control measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
         (d)   Sediment basins shall have both a permanent pool (dead storage)
and additional volume (active storage) with each volume equal to the runoff
amount of a two-year, 24-hour event over the on-site hydrologically disturbed
tributary area to the sediment basin. Two-year storm runoff volumes vs. site
runoff curve numbers are shown in
Appendix J. The available sediment volume below normal water level, in addition
to the dead storage, shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load
generated from the site over the duration of the construction period. For
construction periods exceeding one year, the one-year sediment load and a
sediment removal schedule may be substituted. If the detention basin for the
proposed developed condition of the site is used for sediment basin, the above
volume requirements will be explicitly met. Until the site is finally
stabilized, the basin permanent pool of water shall meet the above volume
requirements and have a filtered perforated riser protecting the outflow pipe.
      (7)   All storm sewers that are or will be functioning during
construction shall be protected by an appropriate sediment control measure.
      (8)   If dewatering services are used, adjoining properties and discharge
locations shall be protected from erosion and sedimentation. Discharges shall
be routed through an approved anionic polymer dewatering system or similar
measure as approved by the Planning, Building and Development Director. The
Planning, Building and Development Director, or approved representative, must
be present at the commencement of dewatering activities.
      (9)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved or after the
temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soil areas shall be permanently stabilized with a uniform (e.g., evenly
distributed, without large bare areas) perennial vegetative cover with a
minimum density of 70% or higher, at the discretion of the Planning, Building
and Development Director, on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by
permanent structures or equivalent permanent stabilization measures.
      (10)   A stabilized mat of crushed stone meeting Illinois Department of
Transportation gradation CA-1 underlain with filter fabric and in accordance
with the Illinois Urban Manual, or other measure(s) as approved by the
Planning, Building and Development Director shall be located at any point where
traffic will be entering or leaving a development site to or from a public
right-of-way, street, alley, or parking area. Pollutants from equipment and
vehicle washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters shall be treated in a
sediment basin or other appropriate measure(s) designed to minimize the
discharge of pollutants, as approved by the Planning, Building and Development
Director. Any sediment or soil reaching an improved public right-of-way,
street, alley, or parking area shall be removed by scraping or street cleaning
as accumulations warrant and transported to a controlled sediment disposal
area. The Planning, Building and Development Director may require additional
stabilized construction entrance methods.
      (11)   The applicant shall minimize the discharge of pollutants from the
exposure of building materials, building products, landscape materials (e.g.
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides), detergents, sanitary waste, and other on-
site materials to precipitation and stormwater runoff.
      (12)   If the installed soil erosion and sediment controls do not
minimize sediment leaving the development site, additional measures such as
anionic polymers or filtration systems may be required by the Planning,
Building and Development Director.

Current Federal Emergency Management Agency maps can be obtained from the
Planning, Building and Development Department or online (http://
maps.lakecountyil.gov/mapsonline).
 
         (a)   The regulatory floodplain is delineated within a development by
projecting the base flood elevation onto the site topography, unless the area
is shown to be within a coastal high hazard area.
         (b)   The base flood elevation shall be obtained from the 100-year
flood profiles, as indicated in the floodplain studies listed below:
            1.   Lake County Stormwater Management Commission regulatory
floodplain profiles;
            2.   Should no Lake County Stormwater Management Commission-
approved regulatory floodplain profile exist for the subject site, the “Flood
Insurance Study, County of Lake, Illinois, Unincorporated Areas”, including all
flood profiles and elevations contained therein, published by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, including the Federal Insurance Rate Map (see
Appendix M, as may be amended by FEMA);
            3.   In the case of Federal Emergency Management Agency-delineated
“AH Zones”, the elevation noted on the map shall be the base flood elevation.
In the case of Federal Emergency Management Agency-delineated “AO Zones”, the
base flood elevation shall be the depth number shown on the map added to the
highest adjacent grade, or at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade
if no depth number is provided; or
            4.   When no base flood elevation information exists, the base
flood elevation shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using
an appropriate model or technique as approved by the Lake County Stormwater
Management Commission or Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of
Water Resources. For riverine flood-prone areas with greater than 100 acres of
tributary drainage area, non-riverine flood-prone areas with greater than 20
acres of tributary drainage area, and all mapped Special Flood Hazard Areas
regardless of drainage area, the base flood elevation determination shall be
submitted to the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission for approval
prior to issuance of a watershed development permit. The base flood elevation
determination for non-riverine depressional floodplains with less than 20 acres
of tributary drainage area shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning,
Building and Development Director. Base flood elevation determinations shall be
based on the critical duration event.
               a.   Where a linear water body has a tributary drainage area of
640 acres or more, the above analyses shall be submitted to the Lake County
Stormwater Management Commission for approval by the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources.
               b.   For a non-riverine regulatory floodplain, the historic
flood of record (as determined by the Planning, Building and Development
Director according to subsection (B)(1)(b)4. above plus three feet), may be
used for the base flood elevation instead of performing a detailed hydrologic
and hydraulic study. However, a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic study may
result in a lower base flood elevation. This Base Flood Elevation option cannot
be used within a FEMA mapped SFHA for proposed development greater than 50 lots
or 5 acres.
               c.    Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the application of
these regulations to land that can be demonstrated by engineering survey to lie
within any regulatory floodplain. Conversely, any lands (except for those
located in a regulatory floodway) that can be demonstrated by a topographic
survey certified by a licensed professional engineer or licensed land surveyor
to lie beyond the regulatory floodplain, and to the satisfaction of the
Planning, Building and Development Director, to have been higher than the base
flood elevation as of the date of the first floodplain mapping denoting the
site to be in a Special Flood Hazard Area and as of the date of the current
effective map shall not be considered to be located in the SFHA.
            5.   The base flood elevation for a Regulatory Floodplain subject
to flooding effects from Lake Michigan shall be the elevation (or in zone AO,
the depth) identified on the FIRM for the site, or the 1% annual chance still
water elevation of Lake Michigan identified in the Flood Insurance Study,
whichever elevation is higher.
      (2)   Permitted uses.
         (a)   Only those uses listed in §
151.148 are permitted by right within a regulatory floodplain regardless of the
regulations of any zoning district. All uses permitted by §
151.148 are permitted subject to compliance with the all applicable performance
standards of §
151.149.
         (b)   All other structures and uses that are permitted by the
underlying zoning district but are not listed in §
151.148 may be permitted in the regulatory floodplain only pursuant to §
151.148(B).
         (c)   Nothing herein shall prevent the rebuilding or extension of any
existing structures permitted by the underlying zoning district, provided that
the rebuilding or extension complies with all applicable performance standards
of §
151.149.
      (3)   Additional application requirements. In addition to other submittal
requirements, all of the following additional information shall be provided for
all development in the regulatory floodplain:
         (a)   Site location of the property, drawn to scale on the regulatory
floodplain map;
         (b)   Plans, cross-sections and profiles of the project showing all of
the following:

navigation channels for work in public bodies of water as defined by the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources;
            2.   Cross-section views of the project for the impacted reach
showing existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water
elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood
elevation and graphic or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical);
            3.   A copy of the regulatory floodplain map with the project site
delineated and marked to reflect any proposed change in the regulatory
floodplain location; and
            4.   All changes in grade resulting from any proposed excavation or
filling; the location and dimension of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   Engineering calculations and supporting data showing that the
proposed work will meet the performance standards outlined in §
151.149;
         (d)   Elevation certificates of the lowest floor (elevation including
basements) for all existing buildings in the regulatory floodplain;
         (e)   Flood-proofing certificates for all existing buildings, or
portions thereof, located below the flood protection elevation; and
         (f)   Evidence that all required federal, state, and local permits
have been obtained. (See
Appendix G for a partial list of permits that may be required.)
   (C)   Regulatory floodways. 
      (1)   Determination and delineation. The location of the regulatory
floodway and the location of the Coastal High Hazard Area shall be as
delineated on the maps listed in
Appendix M, as may be amended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory
floodway boundary, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of
Water Resources shall be contacted. A site located in the regulatory floodway
that is higher than the base flood elevation is subject to the regulations of §
151.150 until such time as a Letter of Map Amendment or Letter of Map Revision
is received from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water
Resources and Federal Emergency Management Agency.

§ 151.149 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT.
   The standards of this section apply to all regulatory floodplain development
except when superseded by more stringent requirements.
   (A)   Modification and disturbance. Modification and disturbance of natural
riverine regulatory floodplains shall be avoided to protect existing hydrologic
and environmental functions. The disturbances shall be minimized and all
negative impacts mitigated as described in a mitigation plan.
   (B)   Prohibited development. No development shall be allowed in the
regulatory floodplain that, singularly or cumulatively, creates a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity, or threat to public
health, safety, and welfare, or impairs the natural hydrologic functions of the
regulatory floodplain and linear/nonlinear water bodies.
   (C)   Maintenance of flood carrying capacity. For all projects involving
linear water body modification or maintenance, fill, or levees, the flood-
carrying capacity of the regulatory floodplain shall be maintained.
   (D)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the
permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant
can demonstrate to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of
Water Resources through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed
project will not, singularly or cumulatively, result in increased flood heights
outside the project right-of-way or in easements for all flood events up to and
including the base flood event.
   (E)   Compensatory storage capacity. When compensatory storage is required
for storage lost or displaced in a regulatory floodplain the following
standards shall apply.
      (1)   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage requirements for
development activity in a riverine regulatory floodplain shall be at least
equal to 1.2 times the volume of regulatory floodplain storage lost or
displaced. The compensation areas shall be designed to drain freely and openly
to the channel and located opposite or adjacent to fill areas. A restrictive
covenant or deed or plat restriction running with the land shall be recorded to
prohibit any future modification to the compensation area.
      (2)   (a)   Hydraulically equivalent com-pensatory storage requirements
for development activity in a non-riverine regulatory floodplain shall be at
least equal to one times the volume of regulatory floodplain storage lost or
displaced. Compensation areas shall be designed to access the required volume.
A restrictive covenant or deed or plat restriction is required to prohibit any
modification to the compensation area. Upon approval of the Planning, Building
and Development Director, hydraulic equivalency for non-riverine compensatory
storage may be altered, provided that the storage is replaced at or below the
existing elevation at which storage is lost or displaced but not below the
proposed normal water level.
         (b)   Hydraulically equivalent com-pensatory storage requirements for
development activity in a non-riverine regulatory floodplain, that is located
partially on-site, with more than 10% of the BFE surface located on-site, shall
be at least equal to 1.2 times the volume of regulatory floodplain storage lost
or displaced. Such compensation areas shall be designed to access the required
volume. A restrictive covenant or deed or plat restriction is required to
prohibit any modification to the compensation area. Upon approval of the
Planning. Building and Development Director, hydraulic equivalency for non-
riverine compensatory storage may be altered, provided that the storage is
replaced at or below the existing elevation at which storage is lost or
displaced but not below the proposed normal water level.
      (3)   Upon approval of the Planning, Building and Development Director,
shorelines or streambanks that have experienced erosion may be restored to
their condition as of the current effective date of the first Flood Insurance
Rate Map in that community without the need to provide compensatory storage or
pay fee-in-lieu-of for the fill used to restore the eroded area according to
the following criteria.
         (a)   The restoration fill shall meet existing grades and within
riverine areas the current effective regulatory floodplain base flood elevation
shall not be increased and the regulatory floodway conveyance shall be
maintained.
         (b)   The amount of eroded property being restored shall be documented
and submitted by the applicant as part of the permit process. Proper
documentation shall be either field survey information or photo documentation
of the erosion that has occurred for the property being restored.
         (c)   For rivers, lakes, and streams where no floodway has been
designated, no documentation of past shoreline erosion is required if the
applicant does not exceed one cubic yard of fill per lineal foot for a maximum
of 200 feet. In this case the placing of the fill shall not significantly alter
the alignment of the shoreline with adjoining properties as determined by the
Enforcement Officer. Non-documentable fills are a one-time allowance on a per
property basis and all fills exceeding 200 cubic yards shall be regulated as
specified in subsection (E).
         (d)   Shoreline protection measures (e.g., sea wall, rip-rap, deep-
rooted vegetation) shall be implemented in conjunction with all shoreline
filling conducted under this provision.
      (4)   An above-ground swimming pool shall not be required to provide
compensatory storage for the volume displaced within the regulatory floodplain.
The pool shall be anchored to resist flotation. No backfilling of the pool
walls will be allowed and any material excavated for the installation shall be
removed from floodplain limits.
      (5)   Compensatory storage is not required in Coastal High Hazard Areas.
   (F)   Public health protection standards.
      (1)   For property located within the regulatory floodplain, no
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal waste, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic materials shall be placed or
stored below the flood protection elevation.
      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, and sanitary sewer
lines may be permitted, providing all manholes or other above-ground openings
located below the flood protection elevation are watertight.
      (3)   On-site individual sewage disposal systems shall be designed to
avoid inundation by the base flood.
      (4)   If required to repair an existing individual sewage disposal system
serving an existing
structure, either shallow or deep filling shall be permitted as a matter of
right to the minimum extent necessary to comply with Lake County Health
Department requirements for the repair. Compensatory storage shall be provided
to the greatest extent possible.
   (G)   Filling.
      (1)   Four types of filling of the regulatory floodplain are regulated by
this section: shallow filling, deep filling, topdressing erosion, and
topdressing subsidence.
         (a)   Shallow filling is filling to realign contours, protect
seawalls, or make yards or lands more useful which does not raise the land
surface elevation above the base flood elevation. The placement of fill
material so as to constitute shallow filling is permitted by right.
         (b)   Deep filling is filling which raises the land surface elevation
above that of the base flood elevation. The placement of fill material within
any regulatory floodplain so as to constitute deep filling shall be permitted
only pursuant to §
151.148(B). For the following deep filling activities, all other standards of §
151.149 shall apply.
            1.   Deep filling required for the construction of a stormwater
basin is subject to the standards contained §
151.146(E).
            2.   Driveway construction to allow access to an attached or
detached garage. Maximum allowable are to be deep-filled shall not exceed 1,000
square feet.
            3.   Fill placed in the floodplain to elevate existing floodtable
land where a new structure is being built. Compensatory storage shall be
provided. The fill shall not be placed more than ten feet from the foundation
of the building.
         (c)   Topdressing is the placement of not more than four inches of
topsoil within the regulatory floodplain for the purposes of stabilizing an
existing erosion control problem and establishing vegetative cover. Topdressing
shall be allowed by permit on a per-parcel, one-time only allowance, and not
damage or alter adjoining property drainage patterns. Upon approval of the
Planning, Building and Development Director, floodplain compensatory storage
shall not be required. Topdressing fill shall comply with the soil erosion and
sediment control standards and wetlands provisions of this chapter (§§
151.145 through
151.154). This provision shall not be applicable to the design process for new
development.
         (d)   Topdressing is the placement of not more than four inches of
topsoil within the regulatory floodplain. For the purposes of restoring pre-
subsidence grade to an area that primarily experiences subsidence due to a
documented flood event, topdressing shall be allowed by permit on a per-parcel
basis and not damage or alter adjoining property drainage patterns. Upon
approval of the Planning, Building and Development Director, floodplain
compensatory storage shall not be required. Topdressing fill shall comply with
the soil erosion and sediment control standards and wetlands provisions of this
chapter (§§
151.145 through
151.154). This provision shall not be applicable to the design process for new
development. A one time allowance of this provision shall be in accordance with
(1) through (3) of the following criteria and repeat allowances shall be in
accordance with (1) through (4) of the following criteria.
            1.   The restoration fill shall meet pre-subsidence elevations, and
within riverine areas, the pre-subsidence effective Regulatory Floodplain and
Regulatory Floodway conveyance shall be maintained.
            2.   The property being considered for top dressing shall be
documented and submitted by the applicant as part of the permit process. Proper
documentation shall be either topographic information or photographic
documentation of the flooding and subsidence that has occurred on the property.
            3.   Upon completion of top dressing, the applicant shall provide
topographic or photographic documentation of completed work.
            4.   Repeat top dressing applications are limited to documented
flood events with topographic or photographic evidence of subsidence.
         (e)   Impervious surface rehabilitative maintenance is the placement
of not more than four inches of pavement or any other impervious material
within the regulatory floodplain. For the purposes of restoring pre-subsidence
grades to an area that has experienced subsidence, rehabilitative maintenance
of such areas shall be allowed by permit on a per-project basis and not damage
or alter adjoining property drainage patterns. Upon approval of the Planning,
Building and Development Director, floodplain compensatory storage shall not be
required. Rehabilitative maintenance fill shall comply with the Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control standards and Wetlands Provisions of this chapter (§
151.146(J) and (M)). This provision shall not be applicable to the design
process for new development. A one-time allowance of this provision shall be in
accordance with subsections (G)(1)(e)1. through (G)(1)(e)3. of the following
criteria and repeat allowances shall be in accordance with subsections (G)(1)
(e)1. through (G)(1)(e)4. of the following criteria:
            1.   The restoration fill shall meet pre-subsidence elevations, and
within riverine areas, the pre-subsidence effective regulatory floodplain and
regulatory floodway conveyance shall be maintained,
            2.   The project being considered for rehabilitative maintenance
shall be documented and submitted by the applicant as part of the permit
process. Proper documentation shall be either topographic information or
photographic documentation of the subsidence that has occurred on the project.
            3.   Upon completion of rehabilitative maintenance, the applicant
shall provide topographic or photographic documentation of completed work.
            4.   Repeat rehabilitative main-tenance applications are limited to
documented topographic or photographic evidence of subsidence.
      (2)   The placement of fill material within any regulatory floodplain so
as to constitute either shallow or deep filling shall be subject to the
following standards.
         (a)   Compensatory storage is required for all storage volume lost or
displaced due to either shallow or deep filling.
         (b)   Fill shall be of a material deemed stable enough to remain firm
and in place during periods of flooding. Fill shall consist only of soil, rock,
or concrete without rebar. Further, all fill areas shall be stabilized with
material which will ensure and protect against erosion hazards, undercutting,
and undermining. Asphalt shall not be used as a stabilizing material. Runoff
and drainage protection shall be provided to adjacent property owners.
         (c)   All changes in velocity, depth of flood elevation, or storage
shall be limited to the property of the owner doing the filling or those
property owners who have granted flood or flow easements, provided that in no
event shall an increase in flood elevation be permitted if it would affect any
existing building or bring any building to within two vertical feet of the
flood elevation.
   (H)   Building protection requirements for Regulatory Floodplains not within
Coastal High Hazard Area. No principal or accessory structure shall be located
in the regulatory floodplain, below the base flood elevation, with the
exception of a road, detached garage, storage shed, swimming pool, boathouse,
pump station, lift station, boat launching ramps, boat docks, piers, bridge and
bridge approaches, picnic shelters having no permanent walls, and stormwater
detention basins. All buildings and structures established in the regulatory
floodplain shall conform to the following standards.
      (1)   Compensatory storage is required for all storage volume lost or
displaced due to the placement of any building or structure in the regulatory
floodplain.
      (2)   Building protection requirements for residential structures shall
follow applicable FEMA regulations and include the following:
         (a)   The lowest floor including basements of all new residential
structures, including additions, shall be elevated up to at least the Flood
Protection Elevation (FPE). The floor of an attached garage for a new structure
must be elevated up to at least one-half of one foot above the base flood
elevation (BFE).
            1.   If placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill for a
residential structure shall be above the FPE. The top of fill for an attached
garage shall be one-half of one foot above the BFE. The fill pad shall be
placed at the appropriate elevation and designed to extend a minimum of ten
feet out from the building’s designed footprint unless the building is
certified by a Licensed Structural Engineer to be protected from damages due to
hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill pad shall meet 95% of Standard
Proctor Density in order to be demonstrated not to settle below the FPE for the
residential structure and not below one-half of one foot above the BFE for an
attached garage, and to be adequately protected against erosion, scour, and
differential settlement. Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five
feet beyond the foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does
not need to meet the compaction requirements.
            2.   If elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation,
the building’s supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters
and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The
bottom of the permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above the
lowest adjacent grade. The total net area shall be provided below the BFE and
consist of a minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each opening
of an enclosed area on a different exterior wall. The openings must have a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding below the BFE. Any louvers, screens, or other
opening covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into
and out of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting members shall be
anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as
to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice,
and floating debris, All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) for
the residential structure and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing,
air conditioning equipment, and utility meters shall be located at or above the
FPE. Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited to, water and
sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible pumps, may be
located below the FPE. No area less than one foot above the BFE shall be used
for storage of items or materials.
         (b)   The lowest floor, including basements, of an existing
residential structure with a substantial improvement shall be elevated to at
least one foot above the BFE.
            1.   If placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill for a
substantially improved residential structure shall be at least one foot above
the BFE. The fill pad shall be placed at the appropriate elevation and designed
to extend a minimum of 10 feet out from the building’s designed footprint
unless the building is certified by a Licensed Structural Engineer to be
protected from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill pad
shall meet 95% of Standard Proctor Density in order to be demonstrated not to
settle below one foot above the BFE for the substantially improved residential
structure, and to be adequately protected against erosion, scour, and
differential settlement. Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five
feet beyond the foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does
not need to meet the compaction requirements.
            2.   If elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation,
the building’s supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters
and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The
bottom of the permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above the
lowest adjacent grade. The total net area shall be provided below the BFE, and
consist of a minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each opening
of an enclosed area on a different exterior wall. The openings must have a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding below the BFE. Any louvers, screens, or other
opening covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into
and out of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting members shall be
anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as
to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice,
and floating debris. All areas lower than one foot above the BFE shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor
(including basement) for the substantially improved residential structure and
all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and
utility meters shall be elevated to at least one foot above the BFE.
Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited to, water and sewer
pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible pumps, may be located
below the BFE-plus-one-foot elevation.
      (3)   Building protection requirements for non-residential structures
shall follow applicable Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations and
include the following:
         (a)   The lowest floor, including basements, of all new non-
residential buildings, including additions, shall be elevated at least to the
FPE or be structurally dry flood-proofed to at least the FPE. A non-residential
building may be structurally dry flood-proofed (in lieu of elevation) provided
that a Licensed Professional Engineer, Licensed Structural Engineer, or
Licensed Architect shall certify that the building has been structurally dry
flood-proofed up to the FPE and the structure and attendant utility facilities
are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The
building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of
rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts
from debris or ice. Flood-proofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms,
floodwalls, and similar works are not considered flood-proofing for the purpose
of this subsection.)
            1.   If a non-residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill shall be above the FPE. The fill
pad shall be placed at the appropriate elevation and designed to extend a
minimum of ten feet out from the building’s designed footprint unless the
building is certified by a Licensed Structural Engineer to be protected from
damages due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill pad shall meet 95%
of Standard Proctor Density in order to be demonstrated not to settle below the
FPE and to be adequately protected against erosion, scour, and differential
settlement. Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five feet beyond
the foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does not need to
meet the compaction requirements.
            2.   If a non-residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation, the building’s
supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters and not subject
to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The bottom of the
permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent
grade. The total net area shall be provided below the BFE, and consist of a
minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each opening of an enclosed
area on a different exterior wall. The openings must have a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the BFE. Any louvers, screens, or other opening
covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into and out
of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored
and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to
minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice, and
floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) for the non-
residential structure and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and utility meters shall be located at or above the
FPE. Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited to, water and
sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible pumps, may be
located below the FPE. No area less than one foot above the BFE shall be used
for storage of items or materials.
         (b)   The lowest floor including basements of all substantially
improved non-residential buildings and attendant utility facilities shall be
elevated or structurally dry floodproofed to a minimum of one foot above the
BFE. A substantially improved, nonresidential building may be structurally dry
flood-proofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a Licensed Professional
Engineer, Licensed Structural Engineer, or Licensed Architect shall certify
that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed up to a minimum of one
foot above the BFE and the structure and attendant utility facilities are
watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The building
design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise,
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from
debris or ice. Flood-proofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms,
floodwalls, and similar works are not considered flood-proofing for the purpose
of this subsection.)
            1.   If a substantially improved non-residential structure is not
dry floodproofed and is placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill for a
nonresidential structure substantial improvement shall be at least one foot
above the BFE. The fill pad shall be placed at the appropriate elevation and
designed to extend a minimum of ten feet out from the building’s designed
footprint unless the building is certified by a Licensed Structural Engineer to
be protected from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill
pad shall meet 95% of Standard Proctor Density in order to be demonstrated not
to settle below one foot above the BFE for the residential structure, and to be
adequately protected against erosion, scour, and differential settlement.
Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five feet beyond the
foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does not need to
meet the compaction requirements.
            2.   If a substantially improved non-residential structure is not
dry floodproofed and is elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other
foundation, the building’s supporting structure must be permanently open to
flood waters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base
flood. The bottom of the permanent openings shall be no more than one foot
above the lowest adjacent grade. The total net area shall be provided below the
BFE, and consist of a minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each
opening of an enclosed area on a different exterior wall. The openings must
have a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the BFE. Any louvers, screens,
or other opening covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of
floodwaters into and out of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting
members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining
structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as
current, waves, ice, and floating debris. All areas lower than one foot above
the BFE shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. The
lowest floor (including basement) for the substantially improved non-
residential structure and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and utility meters shall be elevated to at least one
foot above the BFE. Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited
to, water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible
pumps, may be located below the BFE-plus-one-foot elevation.

   (I)   Building Protection Requirement for CHHA. The building protection
requirements of this section apply to development, including new construction
and substantial improvements in, or partly in, a Coastal High Hazard Area
according to the FIRM.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated
on pilings or columns so that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or
above the BFE-plus-one-foot elevation, and the pile or column foundation and
structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components.
         (a)   Water loading values used shall be those associated with the
base flood.
         (b)   Wind loading values shall be those required by the applicable
state or local building standards. If no state or local building standards
required the application of wind loading values to structural design, then wind
loading values shall be those defined according to American Society of Civil
Engineers 7-16 Minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and
other structures, or other equivalent standard.
      (2)   A licensed professional structural engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to
be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the
provisions of §
151.149(I)(2).
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
         (a)   For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall shall have a
design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds
per square foot.
         (b)   Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of 20 pounds per square foot (either by design or where so required
by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a licensed professional
structural engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all
of the following conditions:
            1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
            2.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values shall
be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those
required by the applicable state or local building standards. If no state or
local building standards required the application of wind loading values to
structural design, then wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-16 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or other equivalent standards.
         (c)   All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work,
or insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage.
      (4)   Placement or substantial improvement of manufactured homes must
comply with §§
151.149(I)(1) through
151.149(I)(3).

151.149(I)(1) through
151.149(I)(3).
      (6)   The use of fill for structural support of buildings within a
Coastal High Hazard Area is prohibited.
         (a)   Non-structural fill within a Coastal High Hazard Area shall be
permitted only if an engineering report demonstrates that the fill will not
cause wave runup, ramping, or deflection of floodwaters that cause damage to
buildings.
      (7)   Man-made alterations of sand dunes within a Coastal High Hazard
Area are prohibited unless an engineering report documents that the alterations
will not increase potential flood damage by reducing the wave and flow
dissipation characteristics of the sand dunes.
      (8)   Within a Coastal High Hazard Area, bulkheads, seawalls, revetments,
and other erosion control structures shall not be connected to the foundation
or superstructure of a building, and shall be designed and constructed so as
not to direct floodwaters or increase flood forces or erosion impacts on the
foundation or superstructure of any building.

§ 151.150 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR REGULATORY FLOODWAY DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Generally. This section establishes performance standards for
development within the regulatory floodway. The only development in a
regulatory floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses which will not
cause an increase in flood heights for all flood events up to and including the
base flood. Only those appropriate uses listed below will be allowed in the
regulatory floodway. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or
placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts,
piles, piers, or columns, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed
to act as a fence), and storage of materials except as specifically defined
above as an appropriate use. If the development is proposed for the regulatory
floodway portion of the regulatory floodplain, the standards of this section
apply in addition to the performance standards for regulatory floodplain
development.
   (B)   Appropriate uses. Only the construction, modification, repair, or
replacement of the following appropriate uses will be allowed in the regulatory
floodway:
      (1)   Public flood control projects and private improvements relating to
the control of drainage, flooding of existing buildings, erosion, water
quality, or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to functionally water dependent
uses such as facilities and improvements relating to recreational boating, and
as modifications or additions to existing wastewater treatment facilities;
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities if sufficiently flood-proofed;
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems
including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any one
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions;
      (6)   Bridges, culverts, and associated roadways, sidewalks, and railways
necessary for crossing over the regulatory floodway or for providing access to
other appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway and any modification thereto;
      (7)   Parking lots and any modifications thereto, where the existing
depth of flooding for the base flood elevation is less than six inches and
aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation (the depth of
flooding can be greater than six inches for parking lots used for short term
outdoor recreational use facilities where the applicant agrees to restrict
parking during overbank flooding events and agrees to accept liability for all
damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events);
      (8)   Regulatory floodway re-grading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a channel;
      (9)   Flood-proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or the construction of flood walls around residential, commercial,
or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall
be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure,
and which are not considered to be substantial improvements to the structure;
      (10)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions of the building are not increased, and
that the activity is not a substantial improvement. An activity that is a
substantial improvement shall conform to §
151.149(H)(2)(b) for residential structures or §
151.149(H)(3)(b) for non-residential structures;
      (11)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the base flood elevation, and which
will not block flood flows including but not limited to fireplaces, bay
windows, decks, patios and second story additions. No enclosed floor areas may
be built on stilts; and
      (12)   Substantial improvements, provided that the outside dimensions of
the building are not increased; the building shall conform to §
151.149(H)(2)(b) for residential structures or §
151.149(H)(3)(b) for non-residential structures.
   (C)   Mitigation. Construction of allowed uses will be considered
permissible, provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering
and mitigation criteria and the standards of §
151.149 are so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations, and data
prepared by a licensed professional engineer.
      (1)   All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the
development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on-
stream structures or dams, shall be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the base flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration.
         (a)   Regulatory floodway conveyance:
            K = 1.4886 AR2/3
                n
      where “n” is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective area of the
cross-section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
         (b)   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
      (2)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of
effective regulatory floodway conveyance, in the design of excavations in the
regulatory floodway, between cross-sections with rapid expansions and
contractions, and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjoining
properties. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used.
         (a)   Water will expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flooded channel’s length.
         (b)   Water will contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded channel’s length.
         (c)   Water will not expand or contract faster than one foot vertical
for every ten feet of flooded channel’s length.
         (d)   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
         (e)   In the design of excavations in the regulatory floodway, erosion
protection shall be provided on land upstream and downstream of proposed
transition sections.
      (3)   The development of all appropriate uses shall not result in an
increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage, for
all flood events up to and including the base flood event. However, in the case
of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be
increased at the structure site if erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by
the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   In the case of on-stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water, an increase in upstream stage when compared to existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood event shall
be contained within recorded easements. A dam safety permit or letter
indicating that a permit is not required must be obtained from the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources for any structure
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flow.
      (5)   If flood-proof construction is required beyond the outside
dimensions of an existing habitable, residential, or commercial building, the
outside perimeter of the flood-proofing construction shall be placed no further
than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage
and conveyance will not be required for flood-proofing activities.
      (6)   For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of
this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources, or Lake
County Stormwater Management Commission in areas outside of Illinois Department
of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources jurisdiction, through hydraulic
and hydrologic calculation that the proposed project will not singularly or
cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way
or easements for all flood events up to and including the base flood event.
(See §
151.149.)
      (7)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows, and regulatory floodway data in the
regulatory floodway study referenced in §
151.147 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appear to be in error or conditions have changed, the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources shall be contacted for approval
and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
         (b)   If the base flood elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving channel with
a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the
requirements of this section for the base flood elevation of the regulatory
floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving channel stream at normal
water elevations. Additional receiving stream elevations may be considered for
design if appropriate and approved by the Lake County Stormwater Management
Commission or Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water
Resources.
         (c)   If the applicant is informed, in writing, by the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources, the Lake County
Stormwater Management Commission or other jurisdictional authority that a
downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be
removed, constructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed, or modified within the next five
years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert, or flood control project is
built.
      (8)   If the appropriate use will result in a change in the regulatory
floodway location or base flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to the
Lake County Stormwater Management Commission the information required to be
issued a Conditional Letter of Map Revision from the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The application will not be considered complete until the
Conditional Letter of Map Revision is received. No filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued by the
Planning, Building and Development Director. The construction or placement of
structures within the currently effective floodway boundary shall not take
place until a final Letter of Map Revision is issued by the Illinois Department
of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency which revises the floodway boundary.
 
COMMENTARY:
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources has
retained permit authority for any Illinois Department of Natural Resources,
Office of Water Resources project, dams, and the like and all other state,
federal, or Lake County Stormwater Management Commission projects. The Lake
County Stormwater Management Commission will issue permits to local units of
government for regulatory floodway development.
 
      (9)   For those circumstances listed below and located in a regulatory
floodway, the following information shall be submitted to the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources or the Lake County
Stormwater Management Commission:
         (a)   Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge, culvert
crossings, and roadway approaches;
         (b)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile; and
         (c)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage.

§ 151.151 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR BRIDGES, CULVERT CROSSINGS AND ROADWAY
APPROACHES.
   This section details special considerations and performance standards for
the construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches, or
the reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culvert crossings, or
roadway approaches.
   (A)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood event unless
contained within the channel banks, project right-of-way, or recorded
easements. The evaluation shall be submitted to the Lake County Stormwater
Management Commission for review and concurrence before a site development
permit is issued.
   (B)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages
greater than one-tenth foot, the developer must contact the Illinois Department
of Natural Resources, Office of Resources for a dam safety permit or waiver.
   (C)   Lost regulatory floodway and regulatory floodplain storage must be
compensated in accordance with all regulatory floodplain performance standards
of this chapter, except that artificially created storage that is lost or
displaced due to a reduction in upstream head loss caused by a bridge, culvert,
storm sewer, or constructed embankment shall not be required to be replaced,
provided no damage will be incurred downstream (see §
151.150).
   (D)   Velocity increases must be mitigated in accordance with all regulatory
floodway performance standards of this chapter except that in the case of
bridges, culverts, or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased
at the structure site if erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use
of appropriate measures (see §
151.150).
   (E)   For modification or replacement of existing structures, the existing
structure must first be evaluated in accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part
3708 to determine if the existing structure is a source of flood damage. If the
structure is a source of flood damage, the applicant’s engineer must evaluate
the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater,
taking into consideration the effects of flood damage to upstream and
downstream properties. Modifications or replacement structures shall not
increase flood stages compared to the existing or regulatory condition,
whichever is greater, for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event. The evaluation shall be submitted to the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources, Office of Water Resources or its designee for review and concurrence
before a site development permit is issued.
   (F)   If the crossing is proposed over a public body of water, an Illinois
Department of Transportation, Office of Water Resources permit shall be
received. (See
Appendix I for a list of public bodies of water.)
   (G)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing
the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile shall be submitted to
the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Water Resources for
concurrence that Conditional Letter of Map Revision is not required.

FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   The applicant, through the Lake County Stormwater Management
Commission, shall obtain approval from the Illinois Department of Natural
Resources, Office of Water Resources for all development with a tributary
drainage area of 640 acres or more located within the regulatory floodplain
without a delineated regulatory floodway. The development shall not, singularly
or cumulatively, result in an obstruction of flood flows or potential flood
damages outside the development due to increased flood heights, velocities or
loss of floodplain storage.
   (B)   The applicant shall meet the requirements of §
151.147 in accordance with following criteria and shall submit to the Lake
County Stormwater Management Commission:
      (1)   An engineering study performed by a licensed professional engineer
which will determine a floodway which meets the definition of the regulatory
floodway and show the proposed development will meet all applicable
requirements of §
151.147;
      (2)   An engineering study performed by a licensed professional engineer
which will determine a base flood elevation and demonstrate that the proposed
development will maintain the existing conditions conveyance, will not increase
flood velocities, will not increase flood profiles and will compensate for all
lost flood storage at a ratio of 1.2 to one in a manner that is hydraulically
equivalent; or
      (3)   An engineering study performed by a licensed professional engineer
which will demonstrate, for a range of flood elevations (which would exceed the
expected 100-year flood elevation), the proposed development will maintain the
existing condition’s conveyance, will not increase flood velocities, will not
increase flood profiles, and will compensate for all lost flood storage at a
ratio of 1.2 to one in a manner that is hydraulically equivalent.

§ 151.153 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR FLOOD TABLE LAND DEVELOPMENT.
   The following flood table land requirements apply to new construction only
and not to additions or substantial improvements to structures within flood
table lands built before August 10, 1999:
   (A)   Public health protection standards.
      (1)   No chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal waste,
fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants, or other hazardous or toxic
materials shall be placed or stored below the flood protection elevation.
      (2)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, and sanitary sewer
lines may be permitted providing all manholes or other above-ground openings
located below the FPE are watertight.
      (3)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be designed to avoid
inundation by the base flood.
   (B)   Building protection requirements.
      (1)   The lowest floor, including basements, of all new residential
structures, including additions, shall be elevated or structurally dry flood-
proofed up to at least the flood protection elevation (FPE). The floor of an
attached garage for a new structure must be elevated up to at least one-half of
one foot above the base flood elevation (BFE). If structurally dry flood-
proofed, a Licensed Professional Engineer, Licensed Structural Engineer, or
Licensed Architect shall certify that the building has been structurally dry
flood-proofed up to the FPE and the structure and attendant utility facilities
are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The
building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of
rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts
from debris or ice. Flood-proofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms,
floodwalls. and similar works are not considered flood-proofing for the purpose
of this subsection.)
         (a)   If the residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill for a residential structure shall
be above the FPE. The top of fill for an attached garage shall be one-half of
one foot above the BFE. The fill pad shall be placed at the appropriate
elevation and designed to extend a minimum of ten feet out from the building’s
designed footprint unless the building is certified by a Registered Structural
Engineer to be protected from damages due to hydrostatic pressures.
Additionally, the fill pad shall meet 95% of Standard Proctor Density in order
to be demonstrated not to settle below the FPE for the residential structure
and not below one-half of one foot above the BFE for an attached garage, and to
be adequately protected against erosion, scour, and differential settlement.
Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five feet beyond the
foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does not need to
meet the compaction requirements.
         (b)   If the residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation, the building’s
supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters and not subject
to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The bottom of the
permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent
grade. The total net area shall be provided below the FPE, and consist of a
minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each opening of an enclosed
area on a different exterior wall. The openings must have a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the FPE. Any louvers, screens, or other opening
covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into and out
of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored
and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to
minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice, and
floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) for the
residential structure and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and utility meters shall be located at or above the
FPE. Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited to, water and
sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible pumps, may be
located below the FPE. No area less than one foot above the BFE shall be used
for storage of items or materials.
      (2)   The lowest floor including basements of all new non-residential
buildings, including additions, shall be elevated at least to the FPE or be
structurally dry flood-proofed to at least the FPE. A nonresidential building
may be structurally dry flood-proofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that a
Licensed Professional Engineer, Licensed Structural Engineer, or Licensed
Architect shall certify that the building has been structurally dry flood-
proofed up to the FPE and the structure and attendant utility facilities are
watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The building
design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise,
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from
debris or ice. Flood-proofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms,
floodwalls, and similar works are not considered flood-proofing for the purpose
of this subsection.)
         (a)   If a non-residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
placed on compacted fill, the top of the fill shall be above the FPE. The fill
pad shall be placed at the appropriate elevation and designed to extend a
minimum of ten feet out from the building’s designed footprint unless the
building is certified by a Licensed Structural Engineer to be protected from
damages due to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill pad shall meet 95%
of Standard Proctor Density in order to be demonstrated not to settle below the
FPE and to be adequately protected against erosion, scour and differential
settlement. Foundation excavations shall not extend more than five feet beyond
the foundation footprint. Backfill for the over excavated area does not need to
meet the compaction requirements.
         (b)   If a non-residential structure is not dry flood-proofed and is
elevated by means of walls, pilings, or other foundation, the building’s
supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters and not subject
to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The bottom of the
permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent
grade. The total net area shall be provided below the FPE, and consist of a
minimum of two openings for each enclosed area with each opening of an enclosed
area on a different exterior wall. The openings must have a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding below the FPE. Any louvers, screens, or other opening
covers must not block or impede the automatic flow of floodwaters into and out
of the enclosed area. The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored
and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to
minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as current, waves, ice, and
floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) for the non-
residential structure and all electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and utility meters shall be located at or above the
FPE. Waterproofed service facilities, including, but not limited to, water and
sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, and submersible pumps, may be
located below the FPE. No area less than one foot above the BFE shall be used
for storage of items or materials.
      (3)   Mobile homes and recreational vehicles to be installed on-site more
than 180 days shall be elevated to or above the FPE and shall be anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement by being tied down in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down
Act issued pursuant to 77 III. Adm. Code 870.
      (4)   Accessory structures and attached garages may be constructed with
the lowest floor below the FPE in accordance with the following:
         (a)   The building shall not be used for human habitation.
         (b)   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation.
         (c)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or flood-proofed to the FPE.
         (d)   All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with materials
resistant to flood damage.
         (e)   The floor must be elevated up to at least one-half (0.5) foot
above the base flood elevation (BFE) unless it meets all the requirements of §
151.149(H)(6).

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
§ 151.165 OFF-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   New development. The off-street parking standards of this section
apply to any new building constructed and to any new use established.
      (2)   Expansions and alterations. The off-street parking standards of
this section apply to all principal and accessory uses when an existing
structure or use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking spaces
will be required only to serve the enlarged or expanded area, not the entire
building or use, provided that in all cases the number of off-street parking
spaces provided for the entire use (preexisting + expansion) must equal at
least 75% of minimum ratio established in the off-street parking schedule of
subsection (B) below.
      (3)   Change of use. Off-street parking must be provided for any change
of use or manner of operation that would, based on the off-street parking
schedule of subsection (B) below, result in a requirement for more parking
spaces than the existing use.
   (B)   Off-street parking schedule. Off-street parking spaces shall be
provided in accordance with the following schedule of requirements. (See rules

   (C)   Rules for computing requirements. The following rules apply when
computing off-street parking requirements.
      (1)   Multiple uses. Unless otherwise approved, lots containing more than
one use must provide parking in an amount equal to the total of the
requirements for all uses.
      (2)   Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces
result in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less shall be
rounded down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-
half shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
      (3)   Area measurements. Unless otherwise specifically noted, all square
footage-based parking standards must be computed on the basis of floor area
used or intended to be used for office space (as a principal use), service
areas accessible to customers, patrons, clients, patients or tenants, including
areas occupied by fixtures or equipment used for display or sale of
merchandise. Floor area for the purposes of this section shall not include any
area used for:
         (a)   Storage accessory to the principal use of the building;
         (b)   Window displays;
         (c)   Offices or spaces incidental to the management or maintenance of
a store or building;
         (d)   Restrooms;
         (e)   Utilities, including HVAC systems; or
         (f)   Dressing, fitting, or alteration rooms.
      (4)   Occupancy- or capacity-based standards. For the purpose of
computing parking requirements based on employees, students, residents, or
occupants, calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working
on any single shift, the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity,
whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
      (5)   Fleet parking. For the purpose of computing parking requirements,
any vehicle owned or leased by a business, government agency, or other
organization, rather than by an individual, shall be provided one space on the
same zoning lot as the principal use. Spaces shall be sized appropriately for
fleet vehicles.
      (6)   Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use
not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Planning,
Building and Development Director shall apply the off-street parking standard
specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or
establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking
study prepared by the applicant. A parking study must include estimates of
parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Planning,
Building and Development Director, and should include other reliable data
collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable
with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale,
bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study must document the source
of data used to develop the recommendations.
      (7)   Consideration of operational standards. The provisions of this
section represent the minimum required parking. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to consider their unique operational needs, which may require
additional parking. The Planning, Building and Development Director may require
additional analysis of business operational needs.
   (D)   Off-street parking reductions for large developments. In order to
prevent the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than actually
needed to meet the particular needs of large developments of over 500,000
square feet of gross floor area, a reduction in the number of required off-
street parking spaces may be permitted by the Planning, Building and
Development Director. Reduction shall be permitted subject to the following
conditions.
      (1)   Maximum reduction. A maximum reduction of one parking space per
every 1,000 square feet of gross floor area or 20% of the total spaces required
(whichever is less) may be permitted. The site plan shall indicate the location
and dimensions of the parking area provided.
      (2)   Reservation. Sufficient area shall be reserved to accommodate the
total number of off-street parking spaces otherwise required by this section.
The purpose of this reservation is to ensure adequate area to meet any future
need for additional parking spaces. The reserved area shall be located on the
same site and noted on the site plan. The reserved parking area shall not
include areas for required landscaping, setbacks, or areas that would otherwise
be unusable for parking due to the physical characteristics of the land or the
requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Installation of additional spaces.  The Planning, Building and
Development Director shall be authorized to require that the developer install
additional parking spaces, up to the total number otherwise required by this
section, if the Planning, Building and Development Director determines that
additional parking spaces are necessary to satisfy the off-street parking needs
of the use.
   (E)   Off-street parking alternatives.
      (1)   Off-site parking. The Planning, Building and Development Director
may approve the location of required off-street parking spaces on a separate
lot from the lot on which the principal use is located, subject to all of
following standards.
         (a)   Limitation on amount of off-site parking. No more than 50% of a
use’s required off-street parking may be located off-site unless the off-site
parking is located on a lot that is contiguous to the lot containing the
subject use. There shall be no limit on the amount of off-site parking located
on a contiguous lot.
         (b)   Ineligible activities. Off-site parking may not be used to
satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses, restaurants,
bars, resorts, convenience stores, or other convenience-oriented uses. Required
parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities may not be located off-
site.
         (c)   Location. No off-site parking space may be located more than 600
feet from the primary entrance of the use served.
         (d)   Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas require the same
or a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served.
         (e)   Covenant for off-site parking. If the off-site parking area is
under separate ownership from the use to be served by the parking area, an
irrevocable written covenant among all owners of record shall be required prior
to approval of the off-site parking. An attested copy of the irrevocable
covenant between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning,
Building and Development Director for recordation on forms made available in
the Planning, Building and Development Department. The covenant must be
recorded in the Lake County Recorder’s office before any building permits may
be issued for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared
parking covenant may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces
will be provided, in accordance with subsection (B) above.
      (2)   Shared parking. The Planning, Building and Development Director may
approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different
operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking
complies with the all of following standards.
         (a)   Location. Shared parking spaces must be located within 600 feet
of the primary entrance of all uses served.
         (b)   Zoning classification. Shared parking areas require the same or
a more intensive zoning classification than required for the use served.
         (c)   Shared parking study. Applicants wishing to use shared parking
as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared
parking analysis to the Planning, Building and Development Director that
clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study must be
provided in a form established by the Planning, Building and Development
Director and made available to the public. It must address, at a minimum, the
size and type of the proposed development, the composition of tenants, the
anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak parking and
traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces.
         (d)   Covenant for shared parking. A shared parking plan will be
enforced through an irrevocable, written covenant among all owners of record.
An attested copy of the irrevocable covenant between the owners of record must
be submitted to the Planning, Building and Development Director for recordation
on forms made available in the Planning, Building and Development Department.
The covenant must be recorded in the Lake County Recorder’s office before any
building permits may be issued for any use to be served by the shared parking
area. A shared parking covenant may be revoked only if all required off-street
parking spaces will be provided, in accordance with subsection (B) above.
 
COMMENTARY:
Certain large uses, such as regional shopping centers, may need fewer parking
spaces than otherwise required by this section, since they typically have a
lower trip generation rate than smaller uses. This provision allows a 20%
maximum reduction in required parking spaces for the uses, while requiring that
land be reserved to accommodate future parking should the need arise.
 
   (F)   Location.  
      (1)   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, required
off-street parking spaces shall be located on the same zoning lot as the
principal use. Except as otherwise provided in this section, off-street parking
and stacking spaces may be located within required setbacks but not within
required landscaping and not within five feet of any property line. In lieu of
providing side and rear setbacks, landowners of adjoining properties shall be
entitled to enter into an agreement that provides for a waiver or partial
waiver of the requirements. The agreement shall be in the form of a covenant or
deed restriction and shall require approval of the Planning, Building and
Development Director. Once approved, the agreement shall be recorded in the
Lake County Recorder’s office and shall run with the land.
 
COMMENTARY:
When ultimate right-of-way is reserved but not dedicated to the highway
authority, required off-street parking spaces are permitted to be located up to
the edge of the ultimate right-of-way.
 
      (2)   However, the parking of any car, van, or truck may occur between
the principal structure and an improved street in residential zoning districts
only on an improved pad not to exceed 400 square feet or on an improved
driveway (in both cases either gravel, paved, or otherwise improved with
hardscape). In no event shall these personal vehicles be allowed to park on
grass or other unimproved surface between the principal structure and an
improved street. This provision shall not apply to nonresidential uses
permitted in residential zones.
 
COMMENTARY:
This provision is not intended to prohibit occasional or “short-term” parking on
grass in front yards for special events (such as family functions, parties, and
the like).
 
   (G)   Use of off-street parking areas. Required off-street parking areas are
to be used solely for the parking of licensed motor vehicles in operating
condition. Required spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or
lease or for long-term storage of vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, mobile
homes, or building materials.
   (H)   Design.
      (1)   Design standards. The minimum size of each required off-street
parking space shall be consistent with the chart below.
 
              Stall Width Stall Length Aisle Width

   60 degre9'          18'          18'/24'
   90 degre9'          18'          24'/24'
 
      (2)   Markings. Each required off-street parking space shall be
designated by lines or parking blocks.
      (3)   Surfacing and maintenance. All off-street parking areas shall be
kept in a dust-free condition at all times. Parking areas for nonresidential
uses that are located between an improved street and the principal building on
the parcel shall be paved.
      (4)   Consideration of operational standards. The provisions of this
section represent the minimum traffic circulation standards. It is the
responsibility of the applicant to consider their unique operational needs,
which may require unique parking stall sizes, aisle widths, and circulation
radii. The Planning, Building and Development Director may require additional
analysis of business operational needs, such as modeling of vehicle
maneuverability.
   (I)   Vehicle stacking areas. Vehicle stacking shall be prohibited within
public rights-of-way.
 
COMMENTARY:
The following guidelines will be used in evaluating the adequacy of vehicle
stacking areas. Vehicle stacking shall be prohibited within public rights-of-
way.

      Stacking spaces must be a minimum of 8 feet by 20 feet in size.
      2.   Location
      Stacking spaces may not impede on- or off-site traffic movements or
movements into or out of off-street parking spaces.
      3.   Design
      Stacking spaces must be separated from other internal driveways by raised
medians if deemed necessary for traffic movement and safety.
   (J)   Accessible parking for physically handicapped persons. A portion of
the total number of required off-street parking spaces in each off-street
parking area shall be specifically designated, located, and reserved for use by
persons with physical disabilities, in accordance with all applicable county,
state, and federal standards.

§ 151.166 OFF-STREET LOADING.
   (A)   No use of public right-of-way.
      (1)   At no time shall goods be loaded or unloaded from the right-of-way
of a collector or arterial street.
      (2)   No part of any vehicle shall be allowed to extend into the ultimate
right-of-way of a collector or arterial street while being loaded or unloaded.
   (B)   Location. Plans for location, design, and layout of all loading spaces
shall be indicated on required site plans.
   (C)   Design.
      (1)   Space size. Off-street loading spaces, excluding maneuvering areas,
shall be at least ten feet wide and 25 feet long unless off-street loading will
involve the use of semi-tractor trailer combinations or other vehicles in
excess of 25 feet in length, in which case the minimum size of a space shall be
12 feet by 65 feet.
      (2)   Surfacing and maintenance.
         (a)   All off-street loading areas shall be kept in a dust-free
condition at all times.
         (b)   Loading areas located between an improved street and the
principal building on the parcel shall be paved.
(Ord., § 9.2, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.167 LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Intent. This landscape section is intended to accomplish the
following:
      (1)   Preserve or enhance the appearance and character of the property
and its surroundings;
      (2)   Reduce noise and air pollution, light glare, soil erosion, and
solar heating of the environment;
      (3)   Provide buffering between land uses and zoning districts of
differing intensity;
      (4)   Promote the preservation of existing significant vegetation;
      (5)   Improve the appearance of parking areas and property abutting
public rights-of-way; and
      (6)   Promote the implementation of best management practices, low impact
development features, and sustainable design elements. (See
Appendix A.)
      (7)   Support ecological sustainability, stormwater management, and
climate resilience.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The standards of this section shall apply to the following
development types (see also §
151.167(J) Landscape standards for transition areas):
         (a)   All development subject to the site capacity calculations/site
plan review procedures of §
151.070(A); and
         (b)   All nonresidential development adding at least 1,000 square feet
of floor area or 2,000 square feet of impervious surface (on any size parcel)
when adjacent to a residential use or zoning district.
         (c)   Any new nonresidential development or use on any size parcel
consisting of at least 1,000 square feet of floor area or 2,000 square feet of
impervious surface.
   (C)   Modification of landscape standards. So long as the intended purpose
of the landscaping is not compromised, landscape requirements may be modified
by the Planning, Building and Development Director in instances such as:
      (1)   When installing the plant material would compromise the health,
vitality, or ecology of existing vegetation, or those natural resources
requiring protection under §
151.070; or
      (2)   Where unique limitations of the site preclude the installation of
the required plant units; or
      (3)   When the principal use of the site is changed to a principal use of
the same or lesser intensity.
   (D)   Previously approved development. A development that was legally
established in accordance with all landscaping regulations in effect at the
time of establishment shall not be deemed nonconforming solely due to the fact
that it does not comply with the landscaping regulations of this section.
   (E)   Plant unit and material standards. Plant material used to satisfy the
standards of this section shall comply with the following standards:
      (1)   Plant units. A plant unit is a measurement used to determine the
quantity of plant material required.
         (a)    One plant unit is comprised of all of the following elements,
of which at least six elements shall be native:
            1.   One canopy tree;
            2.   Two understory trees;
            3.   Two evergreen trees; and

Needleleaf/evergreen shrub      2 feet height
Columnar evergreen shrub        3 feet height
 
         (b)   Types of species. Species of plant material that satisfy the
requirements of this section are contained in
Appendix A. That Appendix categorizes plant species as either “canopy
trees,”“evergreen trees,” “understory trees,” or “shrubs”. With the exception
of native species requirement, varieties and cultivars of the plant species
listed in
Appendix A may be used to satisfy the other requirements of this section,
provided that the variety or cultivar used complies with all applicable size
and form standards.
         (c)   Quality. Plants installed to satisfy the requirements of this
section shall meet or exceed the plant quality standards of the most recent
edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the American
Horticulture Industry Association. Plants shall be nursery-grown and balled
with burlapping or other suitable material that is biodegradable.
         (d)   Additional landscape treatment. All required landscape areas not
dedicated to trees, shrubs or preservation of existing vegetation shall be
landscaped with grass, groundcover, or other landscape treatment, not including
sand, rock, or pavement.
         (e)   Species mix. No single plant species shall represent more than
15% of the total plantings.
         (f)   Berms not required in perimeter landscape transition areas. Any
berm not required by this section but otherwise required by a county condition
of development approval, containing at least five feet in height whose toe is
within 25 feet of any right-of-way or other property line shall be improved
with a minimum of one plant unit per 100 linear feet for every five feet of
height up to a maximum height of 20 feet. The Planning, Building and
Development Director may modify the planting requirements for berms proposed in
locations that will be buffered by existing natural features or are proposed in
locations that will not impact drainage patterns or neighboring land owners.
   (F)   Landscape standards for parking lots.
      (1)   Applicability. The parking lot landscaping standards of this
subsection (F) shall apply to all off-street parking areas containing more than
five off-street parking spaces with the exception of interior landscaping
associated with multi-level parking structures. The standards of this
subsection (F) shall not apply to storage of new or used motor vehicles or
boats or to trucking or motor freight terminals that are not normally open to
the public.
      (2)   Area and planting standards.
         (a)   Parking lots that are greater than 4,000 square feet shall
contain landscaped areas to break up the expanse of pavement. The landscaped
areas shall be located entirely within the lot in either internal or corner
islands and conform to the following area ratios:
 
Parking Lot Area                Required Landscape Area
4,000 sq. ft. to 10,000 sq. ft. 5% of paved surface
Greater than 10,000 sq. ft.     10% of paved surface
 
         (b)   Each 325 square feet of required landscape area shall contain
the following plant material:
 
2 Canopy trees:
   Oaks (Quercus sp), Hickories (Carya sp), Hornbeams (Carpinus 1.25-inch
sp)                                                                caliper
   All other species                                            1.5-inch
                                                                   caliper
5 Shrubs (low growing, not to exceed 3 ft. ht.)                    2 ft. ht.
 
         (c)   Existing vegetation located within the interior or the corner
portions of the parking lot may be counted towards required landscape plantings
upon approval by the Planning, Building and Development Director.
         (d)   Native perennials and grasses may be planted in lieu of shrubs,
up to 20% of the total number of required shrubs. Three native perennial plants
or native grasses shall equal one shrub.
         (e)   The minimum width of all parking lot landscaped areas shall be
ten feet and shall be protected by raised curbs with a minimum height of four
inches with the exception of low impact development features (see
Appendix A) as appropriate.
         (f)   The minimum area for a corner island shall be 200 square feet.
         (g)   The finished grade (crown) of interior planting areas shall not
be less than three inches above curb or pavement with the exception of low
impact development features as appropriate.
         (h)   The parking lot perimeter shall be landscaped with a minimum of
one plant unit per 100 lineal feet (not to include ingress/egress dimensions).
In situations where the perimeter of the parking lot overlaps with the required
transition area, whichever requirement is greater shall apply.
         (i)   Prior to planting, all interior areas shall be excavated to a
depth of three feet and amended with a soil mixture consisting of one part
screened topsoil, one part existing topsoil and two parts of organic compost,
or an approved equivalent, with the exception of other soil mixtures as
necessary to accommodate low impact development features. This requirement may
be waived upon confirmation by the Planning, Building and Development Director
that the pre-existing soil is suitable for planting and drainage, and that no
amendments are necessary.
         (j)   All landscaped areas that are not planted in grass shall be
mulched with a three-inch layer of shredded hardwood bark mulch or stone.
         (k)   A maintenance schedule shall be provided for review prior to
approval of the landscape plan.
   (G)   Best management practices. With the incorporation of best management
practices (BMPs), low impact development practices (LIDs), or other sustainable
practices into the project, the Planning, Building and Development Director may
allow the required landscaping to be reduced or arranged in a manner that will
enhance the design concept. Refer to Appendix A for examples of BMP, LID, and
sustainability features.
      (1)   Considerations shall include the following.
         (a)   To qualify for consideration, sustainability features such as
swales or bio-filters shall be placed in islands or at the perimeter of the
parking areas and shall be designed to improve the filtration and quality of
stormwater runoff.
         (b)   Proposals to modify the type or quantity of landscape material
may be allowed in exchange for the installation of plant species such as native
trees, shrubs, grass, or perennials that will enhance the filtering capacity of
the site and promote the use of diverse native species.
         (c)   Proposed swales or filters using a structural pervious surface
may be used for parking or drive aisles provided the features are designed to
withstand vehicular loads.
         (d)   At the discretion of the Planning, Building and Development
Director, an increase in the on-site impervious surface ratio of up to 10% may
be allowed on the site in exchange for the addition of BMP or LID features,
provided that the total impervious surface ratio shall not exceed 80%.
      (2)   The following BMP/LID incentives are available subject to the above
considerations:
 
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE                INCENTIVES

         (a)   Where a parcel extends to the centerline of an existing street
or where the existing street adjacent to the development site contains less
than the right-of-way width specified in §
151.169, the landscape material shall be located no closer than the ultimate
right-of-way line of local streets and no closer than one foot outside the
ultimate right-of-way of collector streets, arterial streets, and freeways,
unless the roadway authority provides written notice there is no immediate or
foreseen future need to widen the right-of-way.
         (b)   No landscaping shall be located within the existing right-of-way
of any public road without written consent of the highway authority having
jurisdiction over the public road.
   (I)   Landscape standards for common open space.
      (1)   Applicability and standards. Residential subdivisions or
residential developments containing common open space shall provide one-half
plant unit of landscaping for each residential dwelling unit within the common
open space.
      (2)   Location.
         (a)   Plant material shall be installed so it relates to the natural
environment and habitat in which it is placed.

provided that no parking lot, active recreational area, or other structure is
currently located within 30 feet of the adjoining property line on the OS-
Zoned parcel.
 
      (3)   Location.
         (a)   All plant material within transition areas shall be installed
within the required setback line of the proposed development site as close to
the property line as practical.
         (b)   In instances where a drainage or utility easement are
conterminous with the transition easement, the width of the transition area
shall be increased so it does not compromise the function of the transition
area plantings nor the utility or drainage easement.

      (4)    Calculation of plant units. In calculating the number of plant
units required, measurements shall be measured along the external dimensions of
the property.
   (K)    Telecommunication and co-locate facilities. All new telecommunication
towers and co-locate facilities shall require landscaping to be determined by
amount, location and species on a site-specific basis.
   (L)   Exceptions.
      (1)    Plant material existing within a transition area of a proposed
development site or on an adjacent parcel that has comparable composition and
density to the minimum landscape standards of this section may be used to
satisfy landscape requirements, provided that the plant material is designated
and protected as permanent open space and further provided that, if the plant
material is located on the adjacent property, a written agreement between both
adjoining property owners is reached and recorded against both properties. In
this instance, the existing plant material need not comply with the “species
mix” standards of this section.
      (2)   A protected natural resource that exists on a proposed development
site within the transition area or on an adjacent parcel may be counted toward
meeting the transition landscape requirements of §
151.167(J), provided that the following minimum width is provided.
 
Mature Woodland Young Woodland or Grove Other Resources
30 feet         40 feet                 100 feet
 
      (3)   If a development is proposed on a tract of land that exceeds the
minimum lot area standard of the zoning district in which it is located, the
landowner may designate a smaller area of parcel as the development site and
provide landscaping in accordance with this section within the smaller
development site area. In order to use this provision, the size of the
designated development site and the remaining land area of the tract must both
equal or exceed the minimum lot size and width standard of the underlying
zoning district.
      (4)   Landscaping shall not be required for accessory uses or additions
to principal uses, provided that:
         (a)   The accessory use or addition does not exceed 1,000 square feet
of gross floor area or 2,000 square feet of impervious surface area; and
         (b)   The Planning, Building and Development Director determines that
no adverse land use impacts will result.
   (M)   Transition agreements. In lieu of providing transition landscaping
that complies with the minimum standards of this section, landowners of
adjoining properties shall be entitled to enter into an agreement that provides
for a waiver or partial waiver of the requirements. The agreement shall
consider the relationship of the existing uses of each property and their
ultimate development potential. The agreement shall state each owner’s
obligation for preserving and maintaining the transition easements. The
agreement shall be in the form of a covenant or deed restriction and shall
require approval by the Planning, Building and Development Director. Once
approved, the agreement shall be recorded with the Lake County Recorder and
shall run with the land.
   (N)   Use of transition and common open space landscape areas.
      (1)   Passive recreation. Landscape areas may be used for passive
recreation and may contain pedestrian, bicycle, or equestrian trails, provided
that:
         (a)   No required plant material is eliminated and the survival
potential of the plant materials is not compromised; and
         (b)   For the purpose of this provision, passive recreation includes
activities associated with extremely low noise levels and individual
activities, such as birdwatching, walking, jogging, bicycling, horseback
riding, and picnicking. Motorized activities of any kind are not included, nor
are activities that involve competition, large groups or special facilities
such as tennis courts, ski hills, skating rinks, or swimming pools. Lighting,
if provided, shall be extremely low level and associated with pedestrian
walkways in a “campus-like” setting.
      (2)   Drainage and utility easements. Drainage and utility easements may
be allowed within transition and common open space landscape areas, provided
that the easement and landscape requirements are compatible and the function of
the easement is not adversely affected.
      (3)   Structures. No structures, other than those allowed by the
Planning, Building and Development Director pursuant to this subsection (N)(3),
shall be permitted within transition and common open space landscape areas. The
Planning, Building and Development Director shall be authorized to allow signs,
decorative fences, and other accessory structures within transition and common
open space landscape areas, provided that the structures will not detract from
the intended purpose and function of the landscape easement and no plant
material is eliminated.
   (O)   Installation, maintenance, and replacement.
      (1)   Installation.  
         (a)   All landscaping shall be installed according to sound nursery
practices in a manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. Where possible,
best management practices should be incorporated (see Appendix A). Properly
amended soil shall be provided in all planting areas, and subsurface drainage
shall be provided where berms, elevated areas, or other suitable means for
providing proper drainage do not exist.
            1.   All lawn and planting areas shall be cultivated to a minimum
depth of six inches and amended with a mixture consisting of one part existing
topsoil and two parts organic compost, or an approved equivalent.
            2.   When not specifically waived pursuant to subsection (F)(2)(j)
above, planting islands shall be excavated of compacted soil to a depth of
three feet and be backfilled with a soil mix consisting of one part screened
topsoil, one part existing topsoil and two parts of organic compost or an
approved equivalent with the exception of other soil mixtures as necessary to
accommodate low impact development features.
            3.   Individual planting pits shall be a minimum two times the
width of the root ball of the plants.
         (b)   Installation inspections shall be conducted at the time the
planting areas area prepared so that verification of planting pit size and soil
amendments can be completed. The office of the Planning, Building and
Development Director should be contacted to arrange for inspections and
associated inspection fees.
      (2)   Maintenance and replacement. Required trees, shrubs, structures,
and other landscape features shall be considered as elements of the project in
the same manner as parking, building materials, and other details are elements
of the plan. The property owner, or successors in interest, shall be jointly
and severally responsible for the following:
         (a)   All landscaping shall be maintained in good condition and in a
manner that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping
shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds, and litter. Maintenance
shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing, edging,
mulching, or other care, as needed. All maintenance shall be performed in
accordance with acceptable horticultural practices;
         (b)   The repair or replacement of required landscape structures
(e.g., fences) to a structurally sound condition;
         (c)   The regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where
necessary, of any landscaping required by this section;
         (d)   Continuous maintenance of the site as a whole; and
         (e)   The Planning, Building and Development Director shall be
authorized to require documented assurance of continued landscape performance
and/or maintenance in the form of a condition, covenant, contract, development
agreement or performance/maintenance assurance to assure installation and, for
a minimum one-year period, the continued maintenance of landscape improvements
associated with a development. The amount of the performance assurance shall be
at least 130% of the estimated cost of the required landscape improvements. The
maintenance assurance shall be equal to at least 10% of the performance
assurance. Notwithstanding the above, the Planning, Building and Development
Director shall be authorized to reduce or waive the maintenance assurance,
provided the landscape features incorporate best management practices and/or
low impact development features contained in
Appendix A. Any performance and/or maintenance assurance required by the
Director shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of §
151.203 of this chapter.

§ 151.168 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   General. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the provisions of this
section shall apply to all outdoor lighting except lights on lots containing
single family detached houses, public street lights, and the exempt active
outdoor recreational uses specified in the following subsection (A)(2).
      (2)   Exempt active outdoor recreational uses. Because of their unique
requirements for nighttime visibility and their limited hours of operation,
active outdoor recreational facilities within a public park and schools shall
be exempt from the outdoor lighting standards of this section. Exempt active
outdoor recreational uses shall be subject to the following requirements in
addition to the general standards applicable to all outdoor lighting contained
in subsection (A)(3) below:
         (a)   Exempt outdoor recreational uses shall not exceed a maximum
permitted post height of 50 feet;
         (b)   Light sources or luminaires shall not be located within
landscape areas except on pedestrian walkways; and
         (c)   Lights shall not be illuminated after 11:00 p.m.
      (3)   General standards applicable to all outdoor lighting. Outdoor
lighting shall comply with the following standards:
         (a)   Outdoor lighting shall not exceed one-half footcandle at any
point on the adjoining property if the subject property abuts a residential
zoning district or a lot containing a residential use;
         (b)   Outdoor lighting shall not exceed one footcandle at any point on
the adjoining property if the subject property abuts a nonresidential zoning
district or lot containing a nonresidential use or at the right-of-way line;
         (c)   All luminaires shall be shielded to prevent light and glare
spillover to adjacent residential property and abutting rights-of-way;
         (d)   No flickering or flashing lights, search lights, laser source
lights or mercury vapor lamps shall be permitted; and
         (e)   Subject to the above standards, security lighting shall be
installed on the site of nonresidential development in accordance with industry
standards for security lighting.
   (B)   Measurements.
      (1)   Metering equipment. Lighting levels shall be measured in
footcandles with a direct-reading, portable light meter. The meter shall read
within an accuracy of plus or minus 5%. It shall have been tested, calibrated,
and certified by an independent commercial photometric laboratory or the
manufacturer within one year of the date of its use.
      (2)   Method of measurement. The meter sensor shall be mounted not more
than six inches above ground level in a horizontal position at the property
line. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been exposed long enough
to provide a constant reading. Measurements shall be made after dark with the
light sources in question on, then with the same sources off. The difference
between the two readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted
illumination. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight and other
ambient light.
(Ord., § 9.4, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. 19-1378, passed 9-10-2019)
§ 151.169 TRAFFIC AND ACCESS.
   (A)   Street classifications. Classification is the process by which streets
are grouped into categories or classes according to the character of service
provided. Factors that determine the classification of streets include the
width of the roadway, continuity of alignment, spacing of intersections,
frequency of the points of access, and traffic controls. Streets have two
functions: to provide mobility and to provide access to land. There are four
basic classifications: freeway, arterial, collector, and local.
      (1)   Local streets. Local streets provide access to adjacent land,
provide service to travel short distances, provide the lowest level of mobility
for through travel, and provide access service to other streets. Service to
through traffic is discouraged. The minimum ultimate right-of-way width of
local streets is 60 or 66 feet (depending on design), unless otherwise
established through the subdivision approval process of §
151.191.
      (2)   Collector streets. Collector streets serve as intracounty travel
corridors channelizing and distributing traffic to and from arterial and local
streets. Collector streets often provide service by connecting urban areas,
large developments, and other land uses of intracounty importance. The minimum
ultimate right-of-way width of collector streets is 100 feet.
      (3)   Arterial streets. Arterial streets serve or connect major urban
activity centers, are high volume travel corridors, provide for long trip
desires, and form an integrated network providing intercounty and interstate
service. Arterial streets channelize and distribute traffic to and from
collector streets and freeways. Access to abutting land uses is subordinate to
the provision of travel service for major traffic movements. The minimum
ultimate right-of-way width of arterial streets is 120 feet.
      (4)   Freeways. Freeways serve or connect metropolitan areas, carrying
the major portion of trips entering or leaving an urban area as well as the
majority of through trips bypassing these areas. Freeways are high volume
traffic corridors and carry a high proportion of the total area travel with a
minimum of total mileage. Access to freeways is fully or partially controlled.
The minimum ultimate right-of-way width of freeways is 200 feet.
      (5)   Designated freeways. Designated freeways are those streets so
designated as provided for in 605 ILCS 5/8. Collector streets, arterial streets
and freeways as classified by this chapter may all, in addition, be designated
as designated freeways. Access to designated freeways shall be determined by
the highway authority having jurisdiction over the designated freeway from
which access is being taken. The minimum ultimate right-of-way width of a
designated freeway shall be the same as for freeways.
   (B)   Street classifications map. See
Appendix B.
   (C)   Street access.
      (1)   An access permit shall be obtained from the highway authority with
jurisdiction over the street from which access is proposed to be taken. When
the highway authority has not established access standards, the standards of
the Lake County Division of Transportation shall apply.
      (2)   Each lot shall take access to an improved, approved street.
   (D)   Access easements.
      (1)   If a parcel is to be developed with any nonresidential land use, an
access easement shall be provided by the property owner to adjoining properties
which front on the same street and which may be developed or are developed with
nonresidential land uses. Access easements shall have a minimum width of 30
feet and shall be situated parallel to the street right-of-way line abutting
both parcels and at the ultimate right-of-way line unless otherwise established
through the subdivision approval process. Access easements shall be maintained
by the property owner.
      (2)   The Planning, Building and Development Director, after consultation
and written consent of the highway authority having jurisdiction, may waive the
requirement for an easement of access required above in those cases where
unusual topography or site conditions would render the easement of no useable
benefit to adjoining properties.
      (3)   The Planning, Building and Development Director, after consultation
and written consent of the applicable highway authority, may approve the
abandonment of an easement of access in those cases where adjoining parcels are
subsequently developed with a residential use.
   (E)   Fire and emergency vehicle access. Fire and emergency vehicle access
shall be provided in accordance with the Fire Code.
(Ord., § 9.5, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.170 SEWER AND WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   Residential; requirements for community systems.  Community sewer and
water supply systems shall be required for all residential uses in all
residential zoning districts, with the following exceptions.
      (1)   In all residential zoning districts, if community water facilities
are not available within 250 feet at the time of initial development (measured
from the lot line of the subject lot), another approved water source may be
employed.
      (2)   Residential development in the R-1, Estate, Rural Estate and
Agricultural Zoning Districts may utilize on-site sewage disposal systems
regardless of lot size and lot width.
      (3)   (a)   Detached houses may be constructed in the R-2, R-3, R-4, R-
4A, R-5, R-6, and RR Zoning Districts prior to the establishment of required
community sewer systems on parcels containing at least 40,000 square feet of
lot area and 130 feet of lot width.
         (b)   These width and area requirements shall not apply to legal
nonconforming parcels.
 
COMMENTARY:
Community water or sewage disposal facilities that would be available only from a
municipality are not considered “available” for the purposes of interpreting the
provisions of §
151.170. Individual sewage disposal systems may be used for detached houses if
they comply with Lake County Health Department standards. Additionally,
alternative water sources in lieu of community water systems may be employed if
they comply with Lake County Health Department standards.
   
   (B)   Nonresidential.
      (1)   Community water supply systems shall be required for all
nonresidential uses, provided that if community water facilities are not
available within 250 feet at the time of initial development (measured from the
lot line of the subject lot), another approved water source may be employed if
the systems comply with the requirements of the Lake County Health Department.
      (2)   Nonresidential uses that generate more than 1,500 gallons of
wastewater per day, as determined by the Lake County Health Department, shall
be allowed only when served by community sewer facilities.
(Ord., § 9.6, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.171 ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to promote attractive well-
designed development that is built to human-scale; to encourage creativity in
new development (as opposed to homogeneity or “look-alike” projects); and to
foster attractive streetscapes and pedestrian environments, while accommodating
vehicular movement and access.
   (B)   Applicability. These standards shall apply to all developments that
are subject to design review (see §
151.053).
   (C)   Prohibited building materials. The following materials shall not be
used as exterior building materials and shall be prohibited on all exterior
walls:
      (1)   Concrete finishes or precast concrete panels (tilt wall) that are
not exposed aggregate, hammered, sandblasted, or covered with a cement-based
acrylic coating shall be prohibited;
      (2)   Metal panels with a depth of less than one inch or a thickness less
than U.S. standard 26 gauge shall be prohibited; and
      (3)   Mirrored glass with a reflectance greater than 40% shall be
prohibited from covering more than 40% of the exterior walls of any building.
   (D)   Building orientation. To the maximum extent feasible, primary facades
and entries shall face an adjacent street. Except in industrial districts, a
main entrance shall face the adjacent street or a connecting walkway with a
direct pedestrian connection to the street without requiring pedestrians to
walk through parking lots or cross driveways.
   (E)   Massing. Single, large building masses shall be avoided. Structures
with walls of more than 1,500 square feet must incorporate fascias, canopies,
arcades, building setbacks of three feet or more, or other multidimensional
design features to break up large wall surfaces on their street facing
elevations. Wall surfaces must visually be divided by the features into areas
of 750 square feet or less.
(Ord., § 9.7, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.172 INTERSECTION VISIBILITY.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other standard of this chapter, nothing shall be
erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to impede or
obstruct vision between a height of three feet and ten feet above the road
crown within an imaginary area formed by a point on each street centerline
located:
      (1)   One hundred feet from the intersection of local street centerlines
and a third line connecting the two points; or
      (2)   One hundred thirty feet from the intersection of collector or
higher category street centerlines and a third line connecting the two points.
   (B)   This provision may be modified by the Planning, Building and
Development Director after consulting with the subject highway authority. (See
Figure 151.172(B).)

COMMENTARY:
The area described in §
151.172 shall be referred to as the “intersection visibility triangle”.
 
(Ord., § 9.8, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed 8-14-2012)
§ 151.173 SIGNS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Purposes. The purposes of these sign regulations are to:
         (a)   Permit the effective use of signs as a means of communication in
the county;
         (b)   Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the ability
of the county to attract sources of economic development and growth;
         (c)   Maintain pedestrian and traffic safety and minimize the
distractions, hazards, and obstructions caused by signs;
         (d)   Minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public
and private property; and
         (e)   Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign
regulations.
      (2)   Applicability. Signs may be erected, placed, established, painted,
created, or maintained only in conformance with the provisions of this section.
   (B)   Computations and measurements.
      (1)   Sign area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is
also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral section of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when the supporting device otherwise meets the regulations of this
chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
      (2)   Area of double-faced signs. Where the sign faces of a double-faced
sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 90 degrees or
less, only one display face shall be counted in computing sign area. If the two
faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be
the area of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the areas of all faces of
a multi-faced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign.
      (3)   Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance to
the highest point of the sign or sign structure, measured from the elevation of
the road to which it is oriented, or, if there is no road, from the natural
ground elevation beneath the sign.
      (4)   Wall area. In computing the area of a wall only the first 12 feet
of building height shall be used.
      (5)   Maximum total permitted sign area for a lot. The permitted sum of
the area of all individual signs on a lot shall be computed by applying the
formula set out in
Table 151.173(H), Maximum Total Sign Area, to the lot frontage, building
frontage, or wall area, as specified in the table. Lots fronting on two or more
streets shall be allowed the stated sign area for each street frontage.
However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may
not exceed the portion of the lot’s total sign area allocation that is derived
from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
   (C)   Location.
      (1)   Visibility triangles. All signs shall be located outside of
required visibility triangles in accordance with §
151.172.
      (2)   Landscaping. Signs may be located within required landscaping if
the Planning, Building and Development Director determines that the intent of
the landscaping regulations will not be adversely affected.
      (3)   Right-of-way. All signs shall be located outside the public right-
of-way.
   (D)   Signs exempt from regulation. The following signs shall be exempt from
regulation under this section:
      (1)   Any public notice or warning required by a valid and applicable
federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance;
      (2)   Any sign inside a building, not attached to a window or door that
is not legible from a distance of more than three feet beyond the lot line of
the lot or parcel on which the sign is located;
      (3)   Holiday lights and decorations with no commercial message, not to
exceed 60 days per year;
      (4)   Traffic control signs on private property, such as “stop”, “yield”,
and similar signs, the faces of which contain no commercial message of any
sort;
      (5)   Merchandise display signs not exceeding four square feet in area;
      (6)   Barber poles not exceeding 12 inches in diameter and six feet in
height;
      (7)   Vending machines;

allowed, subject to the following standards.
            1.   The electronic message board component of a freestanding sign
may comprise no more than 60% of the sign’s total allowed sign face area. The
electronic message board component of a building sign shall not exceed 48
square feet in a nonresidential zoning district class and 36 square feet in an
institutional zoning district class.
            2.   Freestanding electronic message boards must be mounted on a
base with a width that is at least 75% of the width of the sign’s face, based
on the greatest horizontal dimension of the sign face.
            3.   The maximum height of the electronic message board component
of a freestanding sign shall be 12 feet as measured from the ground elevation
to the highest point on the electronic message board component. This provision
shall not apply to the electronic message board component of a building sign.
            4.   a.   The message area of an electronic message board sign may
be illuminated by incandescent lamps, LED (light emitting diodes), or magnetic
discs. Whatever the light source, undue brightness is prohibited. For the
purpose of enforcing this provision, undue brightness will be construed to mean
illumination of a white portion of the sign in excess of the intensity levels
specified below:
 
Day:   5,000 nits
Night: 1,000 nits
 
               b.   To ensure compliance with this provision, the sign must
have an automatic phased proportional dimmer, which must be used to reduce
nighttime brightness levels (compared to daytime brightness levels). Further,
prior to the issuance of a permit for an electronic message board sign, the
applicant shall provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that
the light intensity has been factory pre-set not to exceed the levels specified
above, and the intensity level is protected from end-user manipulation by
password-protected software or other method as deemed appropriate by the
Planning, Building and Development Director.
            5.   Any individual letter scrolling or otherwise displayed on the
electronic message board shall remain illuminated and visible for at least two
seconds.
            6.   The message shall not flash. Any message that remains visible
for less than two seconds shall be considered as flashing.
            7.   A zoning lot shall be allowed one message board. A message
board sign shall be allowed along a collector or arterial street, but shall not
be allowed along a local street.
            8.   Electronic message board signs are prohibited within 100 feet
of a principal residential structure if any part of the sign face would be
visible from the principal residential structure.
 
COMMENTARY:
At the time of filing the application, the applicant will have to demonstrate
that standard (G)(5)(k)8. is met. This may be accomplished either by showing
that this standard is not applicable or by submitting a landscape plan or a
plan referencing other means of screening that would buffer the sign face from
the principal residential structure.

SUBDIVISIONS
§ 151.185 GENERAL.
   The layout, design and engineering of all subdivision improvements shall
comply with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable county,
state and federal requirements. Whenever a permit, certificate or approval is
established or required by this chapter for any use or structure, the permit,
certificate or approval shall not beissued to any lot or part of a lot which
the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/0.01 et seq.) requires to have been created by a
plat but which was created in violation of that Act.
(Ord., § 10.1, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.186 SUBDIVISION TYPES.
   This section sets out the review and approval procedures for subdividing
land (Subdivisions).
   (A)   General. The “general” procedural requirements and standards of §
151.045 shall apply to the subdivision procedures of this section.
   (B)   Subdivision types. 
      (1)   Major subdivision. Application that involves the creation of more
than five lots.
      (2)   Minor subdivision. Application that involves the creation of five
or fewer lots. (See §
151.187, panhandle lot subdivision, a type of minor subdivision.)
      (3)   Lot split.  Application that involves:
         (a)   The division of a single lot or parcel into no more than two
lots, provided that the division does not involve any new streets or easements
of access. In instances where a new street or easement of access is created,
the subdivision shall be processed as a minor subdivision;
         (b)   The adjustment or movement of a common boundary line between
conforming lots that does not create any additional lots, provided the lots are
under common ownership.
      (4)   Plat amendment. A modification of a portion of a recorded final
plat of subdivision that does not result in any additional lots. Examples
include: reconfiguring existing lots (also defined as a resubdivision),
changing lot or open space boundaries, combining conforming lots, adjusting or
the vacation of easements.
(Ord., § 10.2, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.187 PANHANDLE SUBDIVISION.
   (A)   Criteria for approval. A panhandle subdivision shall be permitted only
when the subdivision complies with the following standards.
      (1)   The parcel displays unusual topography or has sufficient area but
has insufficient width on a street and therefore is unable to be subdivided to
the extent provided for in this chapter;
      (2)   All lots to be created are to be used solely for detached house
(single family residential) purposes;
      (3)   No more than three lots will be created by the subdivision;
      (4)   Development of the subdivision, including the location, length, and
width of the access streets, shall not be detrimental to nor hinder the future
development of any adjoining parcels or the general area;
      (5)   The private street contained within the subdivision shall take
access to a public street which is or will be in the jurisdiction of a public
roadway authority.
   (B)   Access.
      (1)   Access to all lots shall be provided by a private street
constructed in accordance with §
151.194.
      (2)   The private street shall be for the benefit of all adjoining
property owners in the subdivision. All beneficiaries of the private street
shall consent to the future improvement and dedication of the private street
for future public road purposes.
      (3)   Where adjoining parcels are unsubdivided or of a similar character,
the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee may require the street to be
located along the common property line and may also require the street to
extend the full length of the property. The Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee may require the street to be dedicated and improved to standards
required for a publicly dedicated street.
      (4)   The Planning, Building and Development Director, hereafter referred
as the “Director”, shall notify the property owner(s) adjacent to the street of
the proposed subdivision. If Planning, Building and Zoning Committee finds that
the neighboring property will be detrimentally affected by the creation of new
zoning nonconformities, neighbors’ written consent shall be required prior to
acceptance of the final plat for review by the Multi-Disciplinary Team.
   (C)   Review and approval procedure. Panhandle lot subdivisions shall be
subject to the subdivision procedures of §
151.191.
(Ord., § 10.3, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.188 PHASED SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   When a developer has no immediate development plans for a portion of
the land to be subdivided, the portion may be excluded from the legally
described subdivision, provided the remnant parcel conforms to the lot width
and area requirements of the zoning classification in which it is located, and
has suitable area and shape to be separately subdivided or developed. To
subdivide such parcels, the developer shall be required to begin the
subdivision approval process at the Early Assistance meeting stage for each
excluded parcel.
   (B)   When a developer has development plans for the entire subdivision but
desires, for whatever reason, to seek approval and record the final plat in
phases, the subdivision may be platted in phases, subject to the following
standards:
      (1)   The approved preliminary plat shall show the proposed layout for
the entire area of the subdivision to be platted in phases;
      (2)   The limits of each phase shall be shown on the final engineering
plans and the review of final engineering plans shall be completed for the
entire subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat of the first phase
of the subdivision;
      (3)   The total platted area with the platting of each phase of the
subdivision shall function independently in terms of site capacity, natural
resource protection, recreation and open space standards, and engineered
improvements;
      (4)   The entire area to be subdivided, as shown on the preliminary plat,
may be platted with the first phase of the subdivision. Those areas to be
subdivided as future phases of the subdivision may be reserved as outlots for
future development. Such outlots shall reference the approved preliminary plat
and final engineering plans, and the resubdivision of such outlots shall be in
accordance with the approved preliminary plat and final engineering plans. The
final plat approval for the outlots shall be received within the 24-month
period during which the preliminary plat is valid. The Director may grant
extension requests, not to exceed 12 months, for each phase of the subdivision.
When determining whether an extension request shall be granted, the Director
shall consider the circumstances underlying the request and consistency of the
approved preliminary plat with current ordinances.
      (5)   If the proposed resubdivision of any outlot varies substantially
from that approved for the preliminary plat, the Multi-Disciplinary Team may
require submittal and review of revised preliminary plat and final engineering
plans for the outlot. The development of the outlot then may be subject to
regulations in effect at the time of approval of revised preliminary plat.
(Ord., § 10.4, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.189 LOTS AND OUTLOTS.
   (A)   Lots. Lots shall be laid out to promote functional circulation
patterns and compatible relationships among adjacent and nearby land uses, and
shall be designed in accordance with the following criteria.
      (1)   With the exception of planned unit developments, all lots shall
meet the lot width and area requirements of §
151.125 for the underlying zoning district.
      (2)   Subdivision lot layout shall relate to topography, soils, drainage,
natural resources, and planned open space areas. Lots adjoining common or
dedicated open space areas shall be encouraged. Unless otherwise provided by §
151.072(E)(3), the platting of deed-restricted open space shall be prohibited.
      (3)   The design of proposed lots which results in the formation of
irregularly shaped lot lines is prohibited unless the lines follow natural
features such as streams and wetlands, and the like. The Director may approve
irregularly shaped lot lines after evaluation of the issues that created the
irregularity.
      (4)   All lots shall front directly on and have direct access to a street
improved in accordance with the standards of this chapter, or improved and
accepted by the affected roadway authority.
      (5)   Residential lots adjoining freeways, arterials, collectors,
railroad tracks, or lands used for nonresidential purposes shall provide
separation adequate to ensure protection of the residential uses.
   (B)   Outlots. Outlots may be platted in subdivisions for a variety of
purposes including those described in this subsection (B). Outlots platted for
resource protection, open space or utility installation purposes are not
required to meet the lot size or lot width requirements of the underlying
zoning district. All structures located in the outlots shall be constructed in
accordance with the density and dimensional standards of §
151.125 for the zoning district in which they are located, provided the lot
meets or exceeds the minimum lot area requirement for its zoning
classification. If the lot is less than the minimum lot area for its zoning
classification, the structures shall be constructed in accordance with §
151.233.
      (1)   Resource protection and open space. Outlots may be platted for
those purposes designated in §
151.072. Open space areas shall be integrated into the overall subdivision
design to promote ease of maintenance, access, and enjoyment for all residents
of the subdivision. Within a subdivision, the platting of many small open space
outlots shall be discouraged, and the platting of fewer larger open space
outlots shall be encouraged. All outlots platted for open space purposes shall
be identified on the final plat by ownership and purpose (e.g., “Outlot A:
Common Open Space for Recreational Purposes”).
      (2)   Future development. Outlots may be platted for future development
in phased subdivisions or for alternate uses in mixed use subdivisions. (See §
151.188.)
      (3)   Dedications. Outlots may be platted for lands dedicated for school,
park or utility purposes (see §
151.190).
(Ord., § 10.5, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.190 DEDICATIONS, EASEMENTS, AND RESERVATIONS.
   (A)   Dedications.
      (1)   Street rights-of-way. All public street rights-of-way shall be
labeled on the final plat as follows: “Hereby Dedicated for Public Road
Purposes”. Public street rights-of-way shall be dedicated in accordance with
the following:
         (a)   Internal streets. With the exception of private streets (see
subsection (B)(1) below), all land contained within proposed streets shall be
dedicated to the public. Street right-of-way widths shall comply with the
standards of §
151.194.
         (b)   Perimeter streets. When a subdivision abuts an existing public
street, the developer shall dedicate additional right-of-way sufficient to
provide one-half the required right-of-way width for the subject street type.
The following half-width rights-of-way are minimums unless otherwise
established through the subdivision approval process. The highway authority
having jurisdiction may require additional right-of-way to be dedicated, or may
waive the dedication of right-of-way if traffic engineering studies,
transportation plans, or in the opinion of the authority, sufficient right-of-
way exists and additional right-of-way is unnecessary.
 
Perimeter Street Type   Minimum Half-Width ROW
Arterial                60 feet
Collector               50 feet
Freeway                 100 feet
Local (closed drainage) 30 feet
Local (open drainage)   33 feet
 
      (2)   School land. Land for schools shall be calculated and provided in
accordance with §
151.220. Land to be dedicated for school purposes shall be labeled on the final
plat as follows, “Hereby Dedicated to the (School District) for Public School
Purposes”.
      (3)   Park and recreation land. Land for park and recreation areas shall
be provided in accordance with the park contribution requirements of §
151.221. The lands may be dedicated to any public agency willing to accept the
dedication, as provided in §
151.221(H). Land to be dedicated to the public for park and recreational
purposes shall be labeled on the final plat as follows: “Hereby Dedicated to
the (Public Agency) for Recreational Purposes”. Park and recreational areas
created to satisfy the requirements of §
151.070(D), and intended to be owned and maintained by a homeowners’
association, shall be labeled as “Common Open Space for Park and Recreational
Purposes”.
      (4)   Public water supply and public sewage disposal. At the discretion
of the authorized public agency, all water supply and sewage disposal
facilities, including well houses, storage tanks and lift stations, shall be
dedicated to the public and shall be labeled on the final plat as follows,
“Hereby Dedicated to the (Public Agency) for Utility Purposes”.
   (B)   Easements.
      (1)   Access easements (private streets). Private streets shall not be
permitted, except that the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee may approve
the use of existing private streets or the creation of private streets on
parcels that satisfy §
151.187 provided the streets serve no more than three lots. If approved by the
Planning, Building and Zoning Committee, private streets shall comply with the
standards and specifications contained in §
151.194(M). Since private streets will not be publicly maintained, means shall
be established through covenants, conditions, and restrictions, or an agreement
that involves all lots accessing the street, to provide for perpetual
maintenance by the property owners. Private streets shall be labeled on the
final plat as follows: “This Subdivision Contains Private Streets Which Will
Not Be Maintained by the County or Any Other Public Agency. Property Owners
Within the Subdivision Are Responsible for All Maintenance.”
      (2)   Utility easements. Easements shall be provided for any overhead or
underground utility service, including but not limited to sanitary sewer,
water, gas, telephone, and electric. Utility easements shall have a minimum
total width of 15 feet unless otherwise adjusted by the utility provider. Where
multiple utilities share the same easement, additional width sufficient to
avoid conflict shall be provided. Easements shall be established to provide
continuity of alignment throughout the area to be served and to adjoining
unsubdivided areas. Utility easements shall be coterminous with all private
street easements. Utility easements shall not be located within any portion of
a publicly dedicated street right-of-way.
      (3)   Drainage easements. All components of the Lake County Stormwater
Management System, including detention basins, compensatory storage areas and
buffers, shall be included in an easement ordesignated as open space. Drainage
easements shall not be located within any portion of a publicly dedicated
street right-of-way.
         (a)   Storm sewers. Drainage easements shall be a minimum of 15 feet
in total width. Additional easement width may be required depending on pipe
size and depth of cover.
         (b)   Overland flow paths. Drainage easements shall be a minimum of 20
feet in total width. For 100-year overflow paths, calculations shall be
submitted and the drainage easements shall be sized accordingly, but shall not
be less than 15 feet.
      (4)   Alterations to platted easements. Alterations to platted access,
utility and drainage easements shall be processed as minor subdivision
modifications in accordance with §
151.192.
   (C)   Reservations.
      (1)   Areas to be reserved. Whenever all or part of the land to be
subdivided is shown on any officially adopted state, county, or local plan for
a street, school, forest preserve, park, or other public use, upon receipt of
written notification by the agency claiming the reservation, the developer
shall dedicate or reserve the lands for that proposed use. The reservation
shall remain valid for a period of two years from the date the agency is
notified of the proposed subdivision, during which time it shall be made
available for sale to the public agency concerned. The Director shall notify
the developer and all applicable public agencies of the date that the
reservation shall expire. If the public agency has not acquired the reserved
site before the reservation expires, the developer may use it for any purpose
allowed by the regulations in effect at that time.
      (2)   Exemptions. The Planning, Building and Zoning Committee shall be
authorized to exempt a proposed development from the Reservation requirement of
this section, provided the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee has received
a written statement from the applicable public agency that acquisition of the
subject property is not scheduled, intended, or feasible within the two-year
period.
(Ord., § 10.6, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed - -)
§ 151.191 SUBDIVISION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Subdivision review and approval process. Subdivision applications
shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with
Table 151.191(A) below. Unless otherwise authorized in this chapter, each stage
of the process shall be completed prior to initiating a subsequent stage. For
lot splits or plat amendments that proceed directly to the final plat stage,
the Director shall be authorized to require the submittal of information
otherwise required for any subdivision stage and shall be authorized to impose
any additional requirements of this chapter to address potential negative
impacts of the subdivision.

   (B)   Public information meeting.
      (1)   Following the initial review of the Early Assistance Meeting
application by the Multi-Disciplinary Team, a Public Informational Meeting that
includes a neighbor notice in accordance with §
151.045(G)(2)(a) shall be held for all minor and major subdivisions, subject to
the following.
         (a)   The Director shall be authorized to conduct the Public
Informational Meeting for minor subdivisions provided that, within 15 calendar
days of receipt of the neighbor notice of such meeting, no duly notified
property owner files a written request for the Public informational Meeting to
be held before the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee.
         (b)   The Planning, Building and Zoning Committee shall hold Public
Informational Meetings for all major subdivisions, or for those minor
subdivisions, lot splits or plat amendment applications referred to them by the
Director.
      (2)   In instances where the Multi-Disciplinary Team believes development
issues are substantive enough to potentially change the subdivision design, the
Planning, Building and Zoning Committee may choose to delay the information
meeting until the issues are resolved to its satisfaction.
      (3)   A public information meeting shall not be required when a
subdivision is part of a conditional use permit application for a planned unit
development.
   (C)   Concurrent processing of zoning map amendments and subdivision
applications. Unless a subdivision is part of a planned unit development
application, an application for a preliminary plat shall not be accepted until
the necessary zoning approvals are obtained. Applicants shall be authorized to
file an application for a preapplication conference while a zoning map
amendment is pending.
   (D)   Early Assistance meeting. A preapplication conference is intended to
familiarize the applicant with applicable procedures, submittal requirements,
development standards, and other pertinent matters before finalizing the
development proposal or otherwise spending large sums of money in laying out
the proposed subdivision. An Early Assistance meeting may be required for a lot
split or a plat amendment, if in the opinion of the Director the application
involves unique circumstances that warrant review by the Multi-Disciplinary
Team prior to proceeding to the final plat stage.
      (1)   Application filing. Early Assistance meeting applications shall be
submitted to the Planning, Building and Development Department on forms
available from that Department. The application shall be accepted only after a
check-in meeting.
      (2)   Distribution of application; scheduling of Multi-Disciplinary Team
meeting. Upon the completion of a check-in meeting with the Planning, Building
and Development Department and receipt of a complete application, the Director
shall distribute copies of the application to Multi-Disciplinary Team members
and other affected reviewing agencies.
      (3)   Review of application. Within ten days of the receipt of a complete
preapplication conference application, Multi-Disciplinary Team members shall
review the application and provide written comments to the Director. The
Director shall compile all comments received by the end of the review period
and shall make the comments available to the applicant and his or her
designated representative prior to the date of the Early Assistance meeting.
      (4)   Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting. Multi-Disciplinary Team comments
on the Early Assistance meeting application shall be discussed with the
applicant at the scheduled Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting. Following the
meeting, the Director shall provide a written report to the applicant
containing the written comments of the Multi-Disciplinary Team and instructions
for proceeding with the subdivision process.
      (5)   Time limits. Comments furnished to an applicant at an Early
Assistance meeting shall be valid for a period of 12 months from the date of
the preapplication conference. Within this period, the applicant shall file an
application for a preliminary plat, or in instances when a preliminary plat is
not required, an application for a final plat shall be filed with the Director.
If more than 12 months have elapsed, the applicant shall be required to
reinitiate the Early Assistance meeting. Upon receipt of a written request, the
Multi-Disciplinary Team may grant a time extension and may impose conditions as
necessary. In no instance shall an extension be granted for more than 12 months
following the date of the preapplication conference.
   (E)   Preliminary plat. During the preliminary plat stage of the subdivision
process, the general layout and design of the proposed subdivision is evaluated
for compliance with all applicable regulations of this chapter. Preliminary
plat review also allows an analysis of natural resource and other physical
constraints affecting the subject property.
      (1)   Preliminary plat review process.
         (a)   Application filing. Preliminary plat applications shall be
submitted to the Planning, Building and Development Department on forms
available from that Department. The application shall be accepted only after a
check-in meeting.
         (b)   Distribution of application; scheduling of Multi-Disciplinary
Team meeting. Upon receipt of a complete preliminary plat application, the
Director shall distribute copies of application to Multi-Disciplinary Team
members and other affected reviewing agencies and place the preliminary plat on
the agenda. The Director shall notify all preliminary plat reviewers and the
applicant of the date, time, and place of the scheduled Early Assistance
meeting.
         (c)   Review of application. Within 15 days of the receipt of a
complete preliminary plat application, Multi-Disciplinary Team members and
others to whom the application has been distributed shall review the
preliminary plat application and provide written comments to the Director. The
Director shall compile all comments received and make the comments available to
the applicant and his or her designated representative prior to the date of the
Early Assistance meeting.
         (d)   Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting. Multi-Disciplinary Team
comments on the preliminary plat application shall be discussed with the
applicant at the scheduled Early Assistance meeting. Following the Early
Assistance meeting, the Director shall provide a written report to the
applicant containing the written comments of the Multi-Disciplinary Team and
instructions for proceeding with the subdivision process.
         (e)   Resubmittals. In instances when plans are not approved and a
resubmittal is required, the applicant shall prepare the necessary plans and
reports using previous Multi-Disciplinary Team comments as a guide, and shall
contact the Director for a check-in meeting. At the check-in meeting, the
applicant shall include a copy of the plans and reports to be resubmitted and a
cover letter explaining how all comments have been addressed. Plans shall not
be accepted unless a check-in meeting has been conducted or approval has been
given by the Director to submit plans. The review procedure for resubmitted
plans shall be conducted in accordance with initial submittal of the original
preliminary plat application (see subsections (E)(1)(a) through (E)(1)(e)) of
this section. The Early Assistance meeting may be waived if the Committee finds
that the nature of the outstanding comments and concerns does not warrant
another meeting.
      (2)   Information meeting.
         (a)   Notice of Planning, Building and Zoning Committee information
meeting.  Neighbor notice of the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee’s
information meeting on a preliminary plat shall be provided in accordance with
§
151.045(G).
         (b)   Planning, Building and Zoning Committee information meeting.
When the Director has determined that the preliminary plat application is ready
for an information meeting before the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee,
the preliminary plat application shall be placed on the agenda for the purpose
of providing information and receiving public input on the application. The
Multi-Disciplinary Team may present its recommendation on the preliminary plat
at the information meeting, in which case the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee may take action on the preliminary plat at that time.
      (3)   Multi-Disciplinary Team Recommendation.
         (a)   Possible actions. After completing all required reviews and
receiving all departmental/agency comments, the Multi-Disciplinary Team shall
consider the preliminary plat application in light of the approval criteria of
this section and shall take one of the following actions:
            1.   Recommend that the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
approve the preliminary plat;
            2.   Recommend that the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
approve the preliminary plat subject to the applicant addressing all
outstanding Multi-Disciplinary Team and Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
comments, if any, during final plat review; or
            3.   Recommend that Planning, Building and Zoning Committee deny
the preliminary plat application.
         (b)   Approval criteria. In taking action on a preliminary plat
application, the Multi-Disciplinary Team and the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee shall determine that the design of the subdivision and its components
can comply with all county and state regulations.
      (4)   Scheduling of Planning, Building and Zoning Committee meeting.
         (a)   Time limits and extensions. The preliminary plat application
shall be approved by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee no less than
12 months following acceptance of the application by the Director (see §
151.193(A)(2)(a)). If more than 12 months have elapsed, the applicant shall be
required to reinitiate the subdivision process by submitting another
application for an Early Assistance meeting and shall pay the required
application fees unless a time extension is granted by the Multi-Disciplinary
Team. Upon receipt of a written request, the Multi-Disciplinary Team may grant
a time extension and may impose conditions as necessary. In no instance shall
an extension be granted for more than 12 months.
         (b)   Request for action. Once the Multi-Disciplinary Team has issued
a recommendation to approve a preliminary plat application or the applicant has
informed the Director that they are prepared to proceed with a recommendation
of denial, the Director shall place the subdivision on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled Planning, Building and Zoning Committee meeting and notify
the applicant of the date, time, and place of the meeting.
      (5)   Planning, Building and Zoning Committee review and action. The
Director shall present the proposed preliminary plat to the Planning, Building
and Zoning Committee. After considering the matter, the Committee shall act to
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed preliminary plat.
         (a)   Effect of action.
            1.   Approval or approval with conditions. Approval or conditional
approval of a preliminary plat constitutes acceptance of the overall general
planning concepts for the subdivision and is a prerequisite for the filing of a
final plat. An approval or conditional approval indicates that the Planning,
Building and Zoning Committee considers the preliminary plat to be in
compliance with subsection (E)(3)(b) above, and when applicable, what
conditions need to be met by the applicant prior to action on the final plat by
the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee. Approval or conditional approval
confers upon an applicant a right to have the final plat for the subject
subdivision reviewed in accordance with standards of this chapter that are no
more restrictive than those in effect on the date of preliminary plat approval.
Preliminary plat approval or conditional approval does not, however, guarantee
the number of dwelling units allowed; lot configuration; the extent of open
space and natural resource protection areas required; the amount of floor area
or impervious surface allowed; the adequacy of proposed stormwater management
facilities, sewage disposal facilities, and water supply systems; or the
location or configuration of vehicle access points. Neither does preliminary
plat approval or conditional approval limit nor restrict the rights and powers
of any other local, state, or federal agency to impose additional or more
restrictive standards that may affect the layout and design of the proposed
subdivision.
            2.   Denial. If the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee denies
or fails to approve a preliminary plat, the applicant may:
               a.   Amend the preliminary plat application or obtain the
additional information and documentation requested by the Planning, Building
and Zoning Committee and resubmit the subdivision for further review, provided
the resubmittal is within the time limit established in subsection (E)(4)(a);
or
               b.   Appeal the decision of the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee in accordance with §
151.192.
         (b)   Notification of Planning, Building and Zoning Committee action.
            1.   Approval or approval with conditions.  If the Planning,
Building and Zoning Committee approves or conditionally approves the
preliminary plat application, the Director shall provide the applicant with
written notification within five days of the date of the Planning, Building and
Zoning Committee’s decision. The notification shall include:
               a.   A statement indicating the effect of preliminary plat
approval;
               b.   The date of Unified Development Ordinance regulations to
which the subdivision will be subject throughout the remainder of the
subdivision process;
               c.   The date on which preliminary plat approval and all rights
arising from or created by the approval shall expire; and
               d.   Any conditions of preliminary plat approval established by
the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee.
            2.   Denial of preliminary plat. If the Planning, Building and
Zoning Committee denies the preliminary plat application, the Director shall
provide the applicant with written notification within five days of the date of
the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee’s decision. The notification shall
include:
               a.   A statement indicating the effect of preliminary plat
denial;
               b.   The reasons for the denial, as stated by the Planning,
Building and Zoning Committee; and
               c.   Directions for continuing the subdivision process.
      (6)   Lapse of approval. An approved preliminary plat shall lapse and be
of no further effect if a final plat for the subject subdivision is not
approved by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee within 24 months of the
date of preliminary plat approval by the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee. If final plat approval is not received within this 24-month period,
the applicant shall be required to reinitiate the subdivision process at the
preapplication conference stage. If the applicant does not receive final plat
approval within the required 24-month period, the applicant may file an
extension request with the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee. The request
must be received by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee before the
expiration date of the approved preliminary plat. The extension request shall
state reasons for the delay and the proposed length of the extension requested.
In reviewing the time extension request, the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee shall consider the circumstances behind the extension request and the
status of current regulations. There shall be no limit on the number of
extensions that may be granted (for good cause shown) by the Planning, Building
and Zoning Committee, provided that the total cumulative effect of all
extensions granted shall not extend the life of a preliminary plat by more than
12 months. (See also phased subdivision provisions of §
151.188.)
   (F)   Final plat. The final plat stage of the subdivision process requires
review and approval of final engineering plans and final plat documents, which
may be processed concurrently or separately, at the option of the applicant.
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   Final plat. Final plat documents are reviewed for the purpose of
ensuring that the final plat, together with the other documents that will be
recorded to legally create the proposed subdivision, are in full compliance
with the state statutory requirements and all and applicable county
regulations.
         (b)   Final engineering plans and engineering reports. The final
engineering plans and engineering reports are reviewed for the purpose of
ensuring that the layout, design, and engineering of a proposed subdivision
comply with all applicable standards of this chapter. The approved final
engineering plans represents an approved set of construction documents for the
proposed subdivision.
      (2)   Review process.
         (a)   Application filing. Final plat and final engineering
applications shall be submitted to the Planning, Building and Development
Department on forms available from that Department. The application shall be
submitted in person to the Director. A check-in of all documents required in
the final plat stage shall occur separately or at one time. If submitted
separately, a check-in of the final engineering plans and reports shall occur
first followed by a check-in of final plat, covenants, conditions and
restrictions, and agreements.
         (b)   Distribution and review of application. Upon receipt of a
complete final plat and/or final engineering application, the Director shall
distribute copies of the application to Multi-Disciplinary Team members and
other affected reviewing agencies and place the application on the agenda of
the Multi-Disciplinary Team following the review period. The Director shall
notify the Multi-Disciplinary Team and the applicant of the date, time, and
place of the scheduled Early Assistance meeting.
         (c)   Review of application. Within 15 days of the receipt of a
complete final plat application, Multi-Disciplinary Team member agencies shall
review the application and provide written comments to the Director. The
Director shall compile all comments received by the end of the review period
and make the comments available to the applicant and his or her consultant(s)
prior to the date of the Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting where the application
will be discussed.
         (d)   Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting. Multi-Disciplinary Team
comments on the application shall be discussed with the applicant at the
scheduled Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting. Following the Multi-Disciplinary
Team meeting, the Director shall provide a written report to the applicant
containing the written comments of the Multi-Disciplinary Team and instructions
for proceeding with the review process.
         (e)   Multi-Disciplinary Team recommendation. At the conclusion of the
Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting at which the final plat and/or the final
engineering plans and engineering reports are considered, the Multi-
Disciplinary Team shall act in accordance with the following:
            1.   Recommend approval. If the Multi-Disciplinary Team finds that
the final engineering plans and engineering reports demonstrate that the
layout, design, and engineering of the proposed subdivision and the final plat,
and associated documents are in full compliance with all applicable regulations
of this chapter, the Multi-Disciplinary Team shall act to approve the final
plat and/or the final engineering plans and engineering reports for the
proposed subdivision.

Standard Specifications. (See subsection (M)(3) above.)
   (R)   Development standards for unimproved existing rights-of-way.
      (1)   Intent. The intent of this section is to provide development
standards and review procedures for the evaluation and construction of
unimproved rights-of-way located in recorded subdivisions so they can be
incorporated into a township district road system. The applicant for a building
permit or site development permit is responsible to ensure that the street to
which access will be taken meets the minimum standards of this chapter. Due to
the variability of site conditions, right-of-way dimensions, and the extent of
street systems, alternate standards have been created to incorporate
flexibility in the design process.
      (2)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to
unimproved street rights-of-way that are contained within platted subdivisions
existing prior to January 1, 1959. Unimproved rights-of-way that are contained
in recorded subdivisions platted subsequent to January 1, 1959 and have not
been accepted in to a township road system, shall be constructed in accordance
with the standards for a new subdivision.
      (3)   Right-of-way and pavement width requirements.
         (a)   Minimum right-of-way requirements. A street that satisfies the
applicability standards of this section shall have a right-of-way width of no
less than 40 feet. Any unimproved street consisting of a right-of-way width
that is less than 40 feet shall be widened to the minimum standard through
means of a plat of dedication prior to approving the final engineering plans
for construction of the street.
         (b)   Minimum pavement width requirements. The minimum pavement width
standards for qualifying streets shall be no less than 22 feet for rights-of-
way 50 feet or less, and 24 feet for rights-of-way greater than 50 feet, unless
otherwise approved by the County Engineer and the Township Highway Commissioner
of the road district containing the right-of-way.
      (4)   Construction standards.
         (a)   Applicants proposing to develop existing lots adjacent to
existing unimproved rights-of-way shall be required to improve the road across
the full width of the lot(s) from which access will be taken using the
guidelines established in subsection (K)(1) unless modified by the County
Engineer and Director.
         (b)   Unimproved rights-of-way that satisfy the applicability
standards of this section shall be constructed in accordance with the street
design standards of subsection (L), the pavement structure requirements of
subsection (M) and typical cross-sections specified in
Appendix O of this chapter. Adjustments in the width of pavement, the required
end treatment for a stub street, and the need for curb and gutter or sidewalks
will be determined at the time of a preapplication conference described in this
section. Unless otherwise provided for in this section, all waivers from the
minimum street standards shall be approved by the County Engineer.
      (5)   Procedure to construct substandard rights-of-way. Applications for
the construction of unimproved rights-of-way that qualify for alternate street
standards shall be processed as follows.
         (a)   Early Assistance meeting.
            1.   When access to lots is proposed from an unimproved right-of-
way, the building permit or site development permit applicant shall contact the
Director to determine the application procedure. Unless otherwise approved by
the Director, review of permit applications for development on the lots
adjacent to the unimproved right-of-way shall be suspended until a decision on
the development standards for the substandard right-of-way has been made by the
Township Highway Commissioner and the County Engineer, and final engineering
plans have been approved by the Multi-Disciplinary Team.
            2.   Following this meeting with the applicant, the Director shall
contact the County Engineer to arrange a preapplication conference meeting with
the applicant and applicable review and permitting authorities. The purpose of
this conference is for all permitting authorities, the Township Highway
Commissioner, and the applicant to evaluate the condition of the right-of-way
and to determine the requirements for the road cross-section.

issuance of a site development permit, and approval by the County Engineer and
the affected Township Highway Commissioner of all traffic control devices and
construction activities associated with the street improvement plans.
            2.   Any modification or change in the approved plans shall be
evaluated in accordance with §
151.202 of this chapter. Unless an emergency exists, no field change shall
occur in constructing the improvements unless the change is approved by the
appropriate county representative. Any approved field change shall be reflected
on the record drawings submitted as a condition of releasing the performance
assurance for the street improvement plan.
            3.   Reductions, extensions, and releases of performance and
maintenance assurances shall follow the procedures contained in §
151.203 of this chapter.
   (S)   Seeding. All ground surfaces within the right-of-way disturbed by the
construction operations shall be fertilized, seeded, and mulched in accordance
with the Standard Specifications. (See subsection (M)(3).)
   (T)   Lighting. Lighting shall be provided at all intersections and at the
end of all cul-de-sacs and permanent T-turnarounds. The Township Highway
Commissioner may submit in writing to the County Engineer a request to waive or
revise these locations. The County Engineer shall make the final determination
regarding lighting locations. Lighting standards, including pole type,
brackets, luminaries, lamps, and underground wiring shall meet or exceed all

collector shall be of sufficient capacity to carry the maximum discharge for a
storm of ten-year frequency. Depending on the site characteristics, a greater
frequency design may be required.
            2.   The engineer shall select coefficients of runoff based on the
types of development anticipated in all parts of the watershed affecting the
drainage structure. Information regarding future development of the watershed
shall be obtained from the Multi-Disciplinary Team.
            3.   The system shall include all necessary appurtenances such as
inlets, catch basins, and manholes as may be required for proper operations and
maintenance.
            4.   In those cases where a subdivision is subject to stormwater
flow from adjoining land for a storm of 100-year frequency, the developer may
be permitted to substitute an open ditch for storm sewer. The ditch shall
comply with grading, seeding, sodding, and easement specifications of this
chapter. Ditch capacity calculations and typical ditch cross-sections shall be
required.
            5.   All storm sewers shall be at least 12 inches in diameter. All
storm sewers beneath the profile of the proposed street shall be load bearing

(Ord., § 10.18, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.203 ASSURANCES.
   Three types of subdivision assurances are established for the purpose of
assuring proper, safe, and timely installation and maintenance of required
subdivision improvements: restoration assurances; performance assurances; and
maintenance assurances. Assurances shall be required for all subdivisions. The
assurance requirement may be waived by the Director when no engineered
improvements are required or if other means are available to ensure compliance
with the standards of this chapter.
   (A)   General requirements. All restoration, performance, and maintenance
assurances shall be prepared in accordance with the approved formats provided
in
Appendix P of this chapter, and shall be submitted to the Director prior to
approving a final plat. The county shall not accept any assurance that fails to
meet the formats approved by the county, or a form acceptable to the State’s
Attorney’s Office. The County Treasurer shall be the beneficiary of all
assurances.
   (B)   Forms of assurances. The following forms of assurances may be used to
fulfill the assurance obligation of this section.
      (1)   Cash bond. A cash bond shall be made payable to “Treasurer, County
of Lake”. Cash bonds may be provided in the form of a cashier’s check, bank
draft, certified check, or bank money order. A certificate of deposit is not an
accepted form of assurance.
      (2)   Irrevocable letter of credit. An irrevocable letter of credit will
be accepted, provided that the bank securing the letter of credit and upon whom
presentation shall be made is located within the Chicago metropolitan area and
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
      (3)   Surety bonds. Surety bonds shall be provided by a surety or
insurance company that is authorized by the Illinois Department of Insurance to
sell and issue sureties in this state and the surety or insurance company must
have a claims office located in the Chicago metropolitan area. At the time the
principal offers the bond to the county, and prior to acceptance of the bond by
the county, the principal shall provide the name and contact information of the
attorney and bond agent associated with the surety for communication purposes
in the event of a default on the terms of the bond.
   (C)   Restoration assurances.
      (1)   Purpose. Restoration assurances are established for the following
purposes:
         (a)   In the event the developer has commenced construction of
subdivision improvements but has failed to obtain final plat approval within
the time period specified by this chapter, the county may draw on the assurance
and use the funds to stabilize the construction site;
         (b)   If at any time during the construction of subdivision
improvements a clear threat to the public’s health, safety, and/or general
welfare is identified by the county on the construction site, the county may,
after appropriate notice and demand requirements, draw on the assurance and use
the funds to correct the identified threat;
         (c)   In the event the developer fails to complete all subdivision
improvements within the term of the performance assurance and the county draws
on the performance assurance, the county shall also draw on the restoration
assurance and may use the funds to complete any subdivision improvements; and
         (d)   In the event the developer fails to provide a maintenance
assurance as required by this chapter, the county may draw on the restoration
assurance and may use the funds to establish a maintenance assurance.
      (2)   Amount. The amount of the restoration assurance shall be 30% of the
engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as
approved during the review of final engineering plans.
      (3)   Term. The restoration assurance shall be posted as a prerequisite
to commencement of construction activities or final plat approval, whichever
comes first. The assurance shall be posted for a minimum two-year period unless
reduced by the Director after assessing the size of the subdivision, the
complexity of the subdivision improvements, and consultation with the Multi-
Disciplinary Team. However, should the end of the restoration period fall
between December 1 and June 14, the assurance shall expire the first business
day after June 14. In accordance with subsection (F)(3) below, the Director,
for good cause and with the approval of the provider of the assurance, may
extend the term of the assurance.
   (D)   Performance assurances.
      (1)   Purpose. Performance assurances are established for the purpose of
assuring that the developer properly installs all proposed subdivision
improvements in accordance with the approved final engineering plans and
specifications for the subdivision. Should the developer fail to properly
install all improvements within the term of the assurance, the county may draw
on the assurance and use the funds to complete the improvements. The county
also may draw on the performance assurance if the developer fails to provide a
maintenance assurance to the county, if the maintenance assurance is required.
The county may use the funds to ensure proper maintenance of the subdivision
improvements.
      (2)   Amount. The amount of the performance assurance shall be 100% of
the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision improvements, as
approved during the review of final engineering plans. The amount of the
performance assurance is in addition to the amount of the restoration
assurance.
      (3)   Term. The performance assurance shall be posted as a prerequisite
to approval of the final plat of subdivision. The assurance for each phase of
the subdivision shall be posted for a minimum two-year period unless reduced by
the Director after assessing the size of the subdivision, the complexity of
subdivision improvements, and consultation with the Multi-Disciplinary Team.
However, should the end of the two-year period fall between December 1 and June
14, the assurance shall expire the first business day after June 14. In
accordance with subsection (F)(3) below, the Director, for good cause and with
the approval of the provider of the assurance, may extend the term of the
assurance.
   (E)   Maintenance assurances.
      (1)   Purpose.  
         (a)   Maintenance assurances are established for the purpose of
assuring that the developer maintains the structure, function and integrity of
all subdivision improvements in accordance with the approved final engineering
plans and specifications for the subdivision during the term of the assurance.
In the event the developer has failed to maintain subdivision improvements
within the term of the assurance, the county may draw on the assurance and use
the funds to correct the deficiencies.
         (b)   Furthermore, if at any time during the term of the maintenance
assurance the county identifies that the developer’s failure to maintain
subdivision improvements has created a clear threat to the public’s health,
safety, and/or general welfare, the county may, after delivering notice and
meeting demand requirements in accordance with the terms of the assurance
documents and this chapter, draw on the maintenance assurance and use the funds
to correct the identified threat.
      (2)   Amount. The amount of the maintenance assurance shall be determined
by the Multi-Disciplinary Team. Generally, the maintenance assurance shall be
15% of the engineer’s estimate of the probable cost of subdivision
improvements, as approved during the review of final engineering plans. The
Director may waive the requirement for a maintenance assurance when it finds
that the assurance is not necessary.
      (3)   Term. The maintenance assurance shall be posted as a prerequisite
to releasing the performance assurance, unless waived or simultaneously held
with a portion of the performance improvements upon approval by the Director.
The assurance shall be posted for a period of one to three years, and the term
may be reduced or extended based on the size, complexity, or phasing of the
subdivision, as deemed necessary by the Director. However, should the end of
the maintenance period fall between December 1 and June 14, the assurance shall
expire the first business day after June 14. In accordance with subsection (F)
(3) below, the Director, for good cause and with the approval of the provider
of the assurance, may extend the term of the assurance.
   (F)   Reduction, extension, and release of assurances.
      (1)   Procedure. 
         (a)   Initiation. Actions to reduce, extend, or release subdivision
assurances may be initiated by the developer or the county as follows:
            1.   The developer may initiate an action to reduce, extend, or
release a subdivision assurance by submitting the following information and
documentation to the Director:
               a.   A letter requesting the reduction, extension, or release;
               b.   All plans, cost estimates, test reports, certifications,
construction schedules, and/or other documentation necessary to justify the
request; and
               c.   A subdivision inspection fee shall be paid. A copy of the
current subdivision fee schedule is available in the office of the Director.
            2.   The Director shall initiate the process to call on the
assurance as established in subsection (G) below should the developer fail to
request the extension.
         (b)   Inspection notice. Upon receipt of a request for the reduction
or release of a subdivision assurance, or in the absence of a request, the
Director shall schedule an inspection of the subdivision. The Director shall
provide written notice to the developer and all affected reviewing agencies at
least seven days prior to a scheduled inspection. The notice shall contain the
name and location of the subdivision, the time and date of the inspection, the
type and status of the assurance, the purpose of the inspection, and the date
that inspection comments and recommendations are due.
         (c)   Inspection standards and procedures.
            1.   Scheduling limitations. Unless otherwise approved by the
Multi-Disciplinary Team, subdivision assurance inspections shall not be
performed prior to May 1 nor later than November 30 in any year.
            2.   Inspection attendance. The engineer of record shall be present
at all subdivision inspections. The developer’s failure to have the engineer of
record attend the inspection may provide just cause for the Director to
terminate the inspection and may serve as just cause to deny the request. All
agencies notified by the Director shall be present at the scheduled inspection
or shall provide written comments to the Director prior to the inspection.
            3.   Inspection protocol. During the inspection, each reviewing
agency shall be responsible for inspecting the improvements within their
jurisdiction. At the conclusion of their inspection, each agency shall be
prepared to discuss their concerns and note outstanding deficiencies with
developer and the engineer of record. In circumstances where additional
information is required by an agency in order to formulate a recommendation,
that agency shall request this information from the developer. The developer’s
failure to provide the requested information in the time period specified by
the agency may provide just cause to deny the request.
         (d)   Multi-Disciplinary Team comments and recommendation.
            1.   Inspection comments. Each agency shall forward a written
inspection report and recommendation to the Director within seven days
following the inspection. Comments shall identify all deficiencies noted during
the inspection or in the review of test reports and/or as-built plans. If no
deficiencies are noted, this shall so be stated in the report. For performance
assurance reduction requests, each agency also shall identify a dollar amount
reduction for each applicable line item of the cost estimate. Upon receipt of
all inspection comments, the Director shall forward the comments to the
developer.
            2.   Corrective actions. The developer shall be responsible for
correcting all deficiencies and/or addressing all comments identified by the
Multi-Disciplinary Team. In circumstances where additional engineering and/or
improvements are required in order to correct noted deficiencies, the developer

(Ord., § 10.20, passed 10-13-2009)
SCHOOL AND PARK CONTRIBUTIONS
§ 151.220 SCHOOLS.
   This section addresses school contributions related to school land needs to
accommodate additional student population generated by proposed residential
development. Nonresidential developments are exempt from the requirements of
this section.
   (A)   School contribution types. Whenever a school district is entitled to a
contribution pursuant to subsection (A)(2) below, the contributions shall be
limited to the two following options.
      (1)   Ordinance-based school contributions. The developer shall
contribute the requisite amount of land, cash, or a combination of land and
cash, in accordance with the procedures established under subsection (C)
herein.
      (2)   Private agreement-based school contributions.
         (a)   A school district may waive all rights to any ordinance-based
contribution.
         (b)   Notwithstanding any waiver, a school district may enter into a
private agreement with the developer.
         (c)   The administration and enforcement of private agreements shall
follow the procedure established under subsection (D) herein.
 
COMMENTARY:
To ensure timely and thorough consideration of all relevant issues, the
developer and affected school district(s) are urged to discuss the available
school contribution options as early as possible in the county’s development
review process.

Upon receipt of the preliminary plat or, when a preliminary plat is not
applicable, a preapplication conference submission, a copy of which submission
is forwarded by the Planning, Building and Development Director to the Regional
Superintendent of Schools and to the affected school district(s). This
information is used, in part, to assist in the calculation of school
contributions, as provided below.
 
   (B)   Applicability. No school land dedication or cash contribution in lieu
of land dedication shall be required unless the Lake County Regional
Superintendent of Schools has determined that there is an existing or projected
need for school lands to accommodate the additional student population within
the district. The Regional Superintendent of Schools shall make the decision in
accordance with the procedures of subsection (B)(1), below.
      (1)   School land needs determination.
         (a)   The school land needs determination shall be based upon the
existing or future school land needs within the affected school district(s).
The determination shall be based upon a review of available data studies and
literature on the subject, including but not limited to information provided by
the State Superintendent of Education and the unique characteristics of this
county. Projected enrollments shall be based upon current tables of estimated
ultimate population per dwelling unit type, as prepared by Associated Municipal
Consultants, Inc. or comparable data recognized by the Plat Officer. The
affected school district(s) may provide data to the Lake County Regional
Superintendent of Schools to assist in this determination.
         (b)   Following receipt of the school district’s assessment, the
Regional Superintendent of Schools shall submit a final determination to the
Planning, Building and Development Director prior to preliminary plat approval
whether the affected school district(s) in fact faces an existing or projected
need for school lands to accommodate additional student population, and
therefore would be eligible to receive school contributions pursuant to this
subsection (B). The Regional Superintendent of School’s final determination
shall also indicate whether a contribution of land, cash, or a combination of
land and cash shall be required of the developer, in accordance with the
following considerations:
            1.   Land contribution. The contribution may consist of land that
is suitable for intended school purposes, in accordance with subsection (C)(2)
(a)2., below.
            2.   Cash contribution. Where the residential development is small
and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land
is inappropriate for a school site, the developer may be required to pay a cash
contribution for the use in acquisition of land for school sites, or for the
improvement to any existing school site, or for the construction of school
buildings or additions thereto in accordance with Public Act 93-0330.
            3.   Combined land and cash contribution. A combination of land
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land may both be necessary when
only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a
school site; or a major part of the local school site has already been acquired
by the particular district and only a small portion of land is needed from the
developer to complete the site. In these cases, the remaining portion shall be
required as a cash contribution in lieu of land.
      (2)   Notice to parties. Following receipt of the Regional Superintendent
of Schools’ school land needs determination, the Planning, Building and
Development Director shall notify the developer and the affected school
district(s) of the decision in writing.
   (C)   Ordinance-based school contribution procedure. The following
procedures govern ordinance-based school contributions.
      (1)   Calculation of required contribution. The following procedure
governs the calculation of required contributions.
         (a)   Calculation by contribution type.
            1.   Land contribution calculation. The amount of land required to
be contributed shall be determined by multiplying the “estimated ultimate
school population per dwelling unit” (see “Estimated Ultimate School
Population” Table in
Appendix P) by the “site area” requirements for the school site (see “School
Classification” Table in
Appendix P), then dividing by the “maximum number of students” (see “School
Classification” Table in
Appendix P). If the development will be age-restricted (i.e., an exclusively
active adult, independent living, or assisted/supported living facility)
through restrictive covenants or other similar means, the amount of land
calculated above shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.25 to account for the
reduced likelihood of any student generation from the development.
            2.   Cash contribution calculation. The cash contributions in lieu
of land shall be based on the fair market value, as described in this section,
of the gross site valued as improved land in the area that otherwise would have
been dedicated in accordance with subsection (C)(2)(a). To determine the amount
of cash contribution, multiply the “estimated ultimate school population per
dwelling unit” (see “Estimated Ultimate School Population” Table in
Appendix P) by the “site area” requirements for the school site (see “School
Classification” Table in
Appendix P), then divide by the “maximum number of students” (see “School
Classification” Table in
Appendix P). Multiply the resulting acreage by the fair market value of the
land within the area to determine the per lot cash contribution. If the
development will be age-restricted (i.e., an exclusively active adult,
independent living, or assisted living facility) through restrictive covenants
or other similar means, the cash contribution calculated above shall be
multiplied by a factor of 0.25 to account for the reduced likelihood of any
student generation from the development.
 
COMMENTARY:
For purposes of this subsection, active adult developments are generally
synonymous with senior housing that is not accommodated by nursing or other
medical care; independent living developments may or may not provide those
services; and assisted/supported living facilities that are accommodated by that
care. The age-restricted multiplier, above, applies to all such developments.

The restrictive covenants should incorporate provisions to ensure that an
affected school district’s school land needs are sufficiently addressed in the
event the age-restricted development ultimately generates students or otherwise
no longer qualifies as an age-restricted development at any point following
final plat approval (or initial contribution).   
 
               a.   Fair market value determination. The cash contributions in
lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of land in the area that
otherwise would have been dedicated as school sites. In calculating the fair
market value on a per acre basis, the following assumptions about the land
shall be made: that it is zoned in the Residential-1 (R-1) Single Family
Residential Zoning District consistent with the county’s development standards;
that it is developed with appropriate frontage on a dedicated street, stubbed
with county sewer and water and has all appropriate utilities available; that
it is improved as set forth in subsection (C)(2)(a)1. herein; and that it is
property otherwise capable of being used for one-acre single family residential
development. This fair market value shall be determined by one of the two
following methods:
                  (i)   The affected school district(s) and the developer may
execute an agreed-upon statement of fair market value; or
                  (ii)   The developer may provide copies of a fair market
value appraisal of land in the area of the proposed subdivision to the
Planning, Building and Development Director for distribution to each affected
school district and the Regional Superintendent of Schools.
               b.   Consumer price index adjustment to fair market value. The
fair market value identified in this section shall be subject to a “CPI
adjustment” which shall be calculated annually and which adjustment shall go
into effect on February 1, 2009, and on the first day of February in each year
thereafter or as soon thereafter as the data becomes available. The CPI shall
be based on the annual percentage change as published by the United States
Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) for the Chicago-Gary-Kenosha, IL-IN-WI Area
(Identification Number CUURA207SAO). The index base period of 1982-84=100 shall
be used. If the CPI for this particular regional designation is changed,
discontinued, or replaced, any other governmental cost of living index or
computation that replaces the CPI shall be used in order to obtain
substantially the same result as would be obtained if the CPI had not been
discontinued or replaced.
            3.   Combined land and cash contribution calculation. The
calculation of combined land and cash contributions shall follow the
calculation methodology in subsections (C)(1)(a)2.a. and b. of this section,
above.
         (b)   Administration of contribution calculation.
            1.   Signed copies of any ordinance-based contribution agreements
between any affected school district(s) and the developer relating to the use
of land and/or money accepted pursuant to this section shall be provided by the
developer to the Planning, Building and Development Director prior to final
plat approval. The agreements shall be recorded together with the final plat. A
note shall be placed on the plat referencing their existence. Any final
agreement dated more than one year prior to the date of final plat approval
shall be considered null and void and the school contribution process shall be
re-initiated.
            2.   Concurrent with the developer’s submission of the executed
agreement pursuant to subsection 1. above, the affected school district(s)
shall execute an indemnification agreement pursuant to subsection (C)(3)(a)
herein and shall provide an executed copy to the Planning, Building and
Development Director. If a developer’s delayed payment agreement has also been
executed, it should also be submitted to the Director at this time.
            3.   Following submission of the executed contribution agreement,
the Regional Superintendent of Schools shall provide written certification
prior to final plat approval that the terms of this subchapter have been
satisfied. For purposes of this subsection (C)(1), the Regional Superintendent
shall also obtain assurances that good, merchantable title to any relevant
school sites will be conveyed, as verified through warranty or trustee’s deed
and a valid plat of survey for the sites.
      (2)   Procedures for land dedication/ contribution payment. All land
dedication and cash contributions, or combinations thereof, imposed by this
chapter shall be made to the affected school district(s) prior to final plat
approval unless provided for otherwise as noted below.
         (a)   Land dedication procedures.
            1.   Reservation of land. Whenever all or part of the land to be
developed is shown on an officially adopted state, county, or municipal plan
for a school site, the developer shall show all lands so designated as
dedicated or reserved for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of §
151.190(A)(2) herein.
            2.   Dedicated land.  
               a.   The topography, soils, and natural features present on
dedicated school sites and surrounding areas must be suitable for their
intended use.
               b.   All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full
service of electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable television, water and
sewer, streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, where
applicable), and sidewalks and landscaping, all as applicable to the location
of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of this Lake
County Unified Development Ordinance. The site shall have direct access to a
fully improved street. Where appropriate, new school sites should be accessible
by a bicycle/pedestrian trail. Any vehicular access route leading to or on the
site shall be of sufficient size and good geometry to properly accommodate
vehicles that will access and traverse the site, including but not limited to
good principles of traffic circulation, accommodation of one-way and/or two-way
drives for school buses, separation of bus traffic from passenger automobile
traffic, bus drop-off areas separate from publicly dedicated streets, guest and
employee parking areas, and the like.
            3.   Designation on plat.  Land to be dedicated for public school
purposes shall be labeled on the final plat, “Hereby Dedicated to the (School
District) for Public School Purposes”.
         (b)   Cash payment procedures. Cash contributions shall be payable to
the affected school district(s) which will serve the students from the
development and shall be submitted to the school district(s). When payment is
made to the affected school district(s), receipt for payment shall be provided
by the school district(s).
            1.   Payment at time of platting. In calculating the cash
contributions to be paid at the time of platting, the county will assume that
four-bedroom single family units and/or three-bedroom multifamily units will be
constructed. The school district(s) will then hold sufficient funds pending
issuance of the building permit to enable it to refund any overpayments
resulting from the fact that units with fewer bedrooms are constructed. Refunds
shall be made at time of issuance of the building permit upon application by
the property owner to the affected school district(s).
            2.   Payment at time of building permit issuance. With the written
agreement of the affected school district(s), the county may agree that payment
of the cash contributions may be made at the time of building permit issuance.
In consideration for delayed payment, the developer shall execute a developer’s
delayed payment agreement, largely similar in form and content to
Appendix P of this Unified Development Ordinance, as provided under subsection
(C)(3)(b), herein. Proof of payment to the affected school district(s) shall be
provided to the county. The proof of payment must be signed by the affected
school district(s) indicating the receipt of the cash contribution, the name of
the development, the lot number, and the dwelling unit type. Any delayed
payment of fees or cash contributions shall be calculated based upon the “CPI
Adjustment” provided under subsection (C)(1)(a)2.b. herein, which shall be
calculated based on the time at which the building permit is issued.
            3.   Expiration. If any portion of a cash contribution is not
expended for the purposes stated above within ten years from the date of final
plat approval or payment pursuant to an agreement for deferred payment of cash
contributions until the time of building permit issuance pursuant to subsection
(C)(2)(b)2. herein, whichever is later, it shall be subject to refund. Refunds
shall only be provided when the property owner at the time of expiration
presents a written request addressed to the affected school district(s) or
Regional Superintendent of Schools within the eleventh year following the
payment. If the request is not made during the eleventh year, at the
commencement of the twelfth year the school district(s), to the extent
permitted by law, shall be authorized to declare the funds abandoned and use
the money for any legitimate purpose.
      (3)   Limitations on county liability.
         (a)   School district indemnification agreement. Before the county
will impose any payment or dedication requirements on a developer pursuant to
this subchapter, the affected school district(s) shall execute an
indemnification agreement largely similar in form and content to that set forth
in
Appendix P of this Unified Development Ordinance. This indemnification
agreement shall be executed on or before June 1 of each year. Following
execution of an indemnification agreement by the affected school district(s),
the agreement shall be furnished to the county. In the event the affected
school district(s) fails to furnish the executed indemnification agreement as
required in this section, the county reserves the right to refuse to impose any
land dedications and/or cash contributions on behalf of that affected school
district(s) until the time that the executed indemnification agreement is
furnished by the affected school district(s).
         (b)   Developer’s delayed payment agreement. If the school district(s)
and the developer agree to defer the payment of cash contributions to the time
of building permit issuance, the developer shall execute a developer’s delayed
payment agreement prior to final plat approval which shall provide that the
developer agrees: that the cash contributions payable will be adjusted in
accordance with the “CPI Adjustment” requirements herein; that the cash
contributions may be expended for the purposes described in
Appendix P; and to accept the validity of the Unified Development Ordinance and
the cash contributions as calculated. The developer’s delayed payment
agreement, or memorandum thereof, shall be recorded along with the plat of
subdivision upon approval by the county.
      (4)   Objection procedures.
         (a)   Applicability. The developer or affected school district(s) may
file objections to the contribution calculations (subsection (C)(1)) as
provided for in this section. Requests to modify any other provision of this
section shall follow the major modification procedure of §
151.192(C) herein.
         (b)   Time of filing. Prior to final plat approval, the developer or
school district(s) shall, in writing, either concur with the application of the
school contribution provisions of this subchapter or file an objection or
request a waiver thereto, as applicable under subsection (C)(4)(a) above.
Failure to file a concurrence, objections or waiver request with the Planning,
Building and Development Director within the specified time period shall
operate as a concurrence with the application of these provisions.
         (c)   Form of filing. An objection shall be submitted in a format as
provided in
Appendix P. The form shall be accompanied by an alternate determination or set
of contribution calculations and filing fee, as applicable.
         (d)   Scheduling of hearing. Upon receipt of a valid objection, the
Planning, Building and Development Director shall schedule a hearing before the
Planning, Building and Zoning Committee to occur within 60 days of receipt of
the written objection and shall inform the Planning, Building and Zoning
Committee of the hearing.
         (e)   Notices.
            1.   The Planning, Building and Development Director shall notify
the developer, the affected school districts and the Regional Superintendent of
Schools by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the filing of the

thereto, in addition to any other relevant available information relating to
the objection. The Planning, Building and Zoning Committee may also retain the
services of professionals (attorneys, appraisers, statisticians, and the like)
to assist in its review of issues raised by any objection.
         (g)   Procedure for resolving an objection. The Planning, Building and
Zoning Committee shall conduct the public hearing to resolve a properly filed
objection, in accordance with the following procedure.
            1.   A public hearing shall be held for the consideration of the
objection. The developer, the affected school district(s) and the Regional
Superintendent of Schools shall be allowed to participate in the hearing as a
party thereto to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and make arguments
to the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee regarding the issues raised in
the objection. The public shall be allowed to provide comments relating to the

Committee decision, the Planning, Building and Development Director shall
provide the developer, affected school district(s), and Regional Superintendent
of Schools with written notice of the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee’s
decision.
         (h)   Costs and fees. The objector shall bear all costs of the hearing
before the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee, including but not limited
to publication costs, professional consultants, shorthand reporter services and
transcript costs, and any other expenses of the county.
         (i)   Appeals of Planning, Building and Zoning Committee actions.
Appeals of actions or decisions of the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
under the school contribution provisions of this §
151.220 shall be filed within 15 days of the date on the notice of the action
or decision. With the exception of this filing deadline, appeals shall be made
in accordance with §
151.192(D)(2) of this chapter.
   (D)   Private agreements for school contributions. This subsection (D)
governs the administration and enforcement of private agreements for school
contributions not subject to the requirements of subsection (C) above.
      (1)   Applicability. This subsection (D) shall apply whenever an affected
school district(s) and the developer reach a private agreement regarding school
contributions in lieu of following the ordinance-based school contribution
provisions contained in subsection (C) of this section.
      (2)   Administration.
         (a)   Signed copies of the private agreement(s) between any affected
school district(s) and the developer, dated not more than one year prior to the
date of final plat approval, shall be forwarded to the Planning, Building and
Development Director prior to final plat approval. The agreement(s) shall be
recorded together with the final plat. A note shall be placed on the plat
referencing their existence. Any final agreement dated more than one year prior
to the date of final plat approval shall be considered null and void for
purposes of this chapter and the school contribution process shall be re-
initiated.
         (b)   Prior to final plat approval, the Regional Superintendent of
Schools shall provide written certification that the terms of this section
governing private agreements has been satisfied for the subject development.
      (3)   Payment procedures.  
         (a)   Generally. Any private agreement shall provide that the cash
contributions shall be payable directly to the school district(s) which will
serve the students from the subdivision and be submitted to the school district
(s). When payment is made to the affected school district(s) pursuant to a
private agreement, the school district(s) shall provide a receipt for the
payment to the developer.
         (b)   Time of payment.
            1.   Payment upon final plat approval. All land dedications and
cash contributions imposed by private agreement shall be due and payable to the
affected school district(s) upon final plat approval unless otherwise specified
by the terms of the private agreement.
            2.   Payment at time of building permit issuance. With the written
agreement of the affected school district(s), payment of cash contributions
pursuant to the private agreement may be made at the time of building permit
issuance. In the event of this deferred payment pursuant to private agreement,
proof of payment to the affected school district(s) shall be provided to the
county prior to building permit issuance. The proof of payment must be signed
by the affected school district(s) indicating the receipt of the cash
contribution, the name of the development, the lot number, and the dwelling
unit type.
      (4)   Limitations on county liability. Although the county may require
proof of payment for contributions on behalf of a school district pursuant to a
private agreement between the school district and the developer, the county
shall not be considered a party to the agreement, nor shall the private
agreement place any responsibility or liability upon the county for the content
of any of the provisions or terms contained therein for any reason, including
but not limited to the extent that the provisions or terms are not authorized
by the school contribution requirements of this subchapter. Consistent with
this limitation on county liability, the following agreements shall be executed
in conjunction with a private school contribution agreement:
         (a)   School district indemnification agreement.
            1.   If a private agreement is reached between the developer and
the affected school district, the affected school district shall execute an
indemnification agreement largely similar in form and content to that set forth
in
Appendix P of this Unified Development Ordinance. This agreement shall be
executed on or before June 1 of each subsequent year. Following execution of
this agreement by the affected school district, this indemnification agreement
shall be furnished to the county and the Regional Superintendent of Schools. In
the event the affected school district fails to furnish the executed agreement
as required in this section, the county reserves the right to forego
enforcement of the proof of payment procedure set forth in subsection (D)(3)
above.
            2.   Any private agreement shall provide that the cash
contributions shall be payable directly to the school district(s) which will
serve the students from the subdivision and be submitted to the school district
(s). When payment is made to the affected school district(s) pursuant to a
private agreement, the school district(s) shall provide a receipt for the
payment to the developer upon receipt of payment.
         (b)   Developer’s county liability waiver agreement. In consideration
for the county’s agreement to permit a developer to enter into a private
agreement with an affected school district(s), the developer shall execute a
waiver agreement, largely similar in form and content to the county liability
waiver agreement in
Appendix P of this Unified Development Ordinance.
            1.   The waiver agreement shall provide that the developer agrees:
               a.   That the county is not a party to the private agreement and
is not responsible or liable for the terms of the private agreement for any
reason, including but not limited to the extent that the private agreement
provides for contributions beyond what is authorized by the contribution
requirements of §
151.220 of this County Unified Development Ordinance; and
               b.   That the developer and the developer’s successors and
assigns waive any future right to object to any aspect of this chapter or
institute any legal action against the county with respect to any aspect
thereof as it applies to the development under review.
            2.   This developer’s county liability waiver agreement, or
memorandum thereof, shall be recorded along with the plat of subdivision upon
approval by the county.
(Ord., § 11.1, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.221 PARK AND RECREATION AREAS.
   (A)   Purpose. As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision of
any parcel of land within unincorporated Lake County, in order to provide
proximate recreation land for the residents of the subdivision, qualifying
developers shall be required to:
      (1)   Permanently set aside land for active or passive recreation
purposes;
      (2)   Provide a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication; or
      (3)   Provide a combination of both.
   (B)   Applicability. The recreation land dedication or cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall apply to all residential land developments with two
exceptions.
      (1)   Subdivisions composed entirely of single family detached houses
having a net density equal to or less than 1.25 dwelling units per acre shall
not be required to dedicate land or contribute cash; and
      (2)   Subdivisions which would be required to provide less than one-
fourth acre of recreation land shall not be required to dedicate land or
contribute cash.
   (C)   Calculations. The recreational land requirement is determined by the
site capacity regulations of §
151.070(D).
   (D)   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Recreation improvements shall be accessible to all residents of the
subdivision.
      (2)   Access to recreation areas shall be provided from internal
subdivision streets.
      (3)   Recreation improvements shall be designed so they maximize their
use and enjoyment for the population served.
      (4)   Proposed subdivisions may provide passive and active recreation
improvements. Passive recreation improvements may consist of trails, picnic
areas and benches. Active recreation improvements may consist of sports fields,
game tables, tennis courts, sand boxes, and other playground equipment.
      (5)   Landscaping within recreation areas shall be designed to be
aesthetically pleasing and functionally usable for the specified purpose.
      (6)   All sites shall be ready for full service of electrical, gas,
water, sewer, sidewalk, streets and storm drainage where those services are
included in the subdivision and as applicable to the location of the site.
      (7)   When appropriate, recreation improvements may be combined with that
of an adjoining subdivision in order to produce more useable recreation areas
or trail linkages.
   (E)   Review requirements.
      (1)   The proposed recreation areas shall be designated on the
preliminary plat.
      (2)   Plans, cost estimates, and other information necessary to ensure
the proper designation, use, maintenance, ownership, and installation of all
recreation improvements required by this chapter shall be submitted as part of
the final engineering plans.
      (3)   Recreation improvement plans shall include but shall not be limited
to the following:
          (a)   Site location;
         (b)   Points of access;
         (c)   Site design, including landscaping; and
         (d)   Equipment specifications.
   (F)   Installation. The recreation improvements shall be installed in
accordance with the approved final engineering plans. The installation of
recreation improvements shall be guaranteed by including costs of the
improvements in the performance assurance deposited with the county.
   (G)   Maintenance.  
      (1)   The maintenance of recreation improvements shall be guaranteed by
providing the county a maintenance assurance for the amount and term specified
by the county.
      (2)   The developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
improvements until the time that 80% of the lots in the subdivision have been
sold. However, the developer shall not transfer the improvements for the
purpose of maintenance until all maintenance assurances are released by the
county.
      (3)   The maintenance and improvement responsibilities for the recreation
areas shall be determined based upon the form of ownership and finalized at the
time of the final plat review.
      (4)   Maintenance of the recreation improvements shall consist of all
acts necessary to ensure that they remain usable and that no hazards,
nuisances, or unhealthy conditions exist.
   (H)   Ownership.
      (1)   Recreation improvements shall be either publicly dedicated or
commonly owned.
         (a)   The developer may dedicate the sites to any suitable public or
not-for-profit entity approved by the Planning, Building and Development
Director; or
         (b)   If the developer does not choose to dedicate the sites or if
there is no public agency willing to accept the dedication, provisions shall be
made for a compulsory homeowners’ association as a means of assuring that the
land will be maintained and preserved in perpetuity as commonly held
recreational open space.
      (2)   The developer shall be responsible for conveying good, marketable
title to the sites and shall be responsible for payment of all real estate
taxes to date of conveyance.
      (3)   Articles of agreement for a homeowners’ association, or any other
necessary documents, shall specify the appropriate maintenance responsibilities
for all active and passive recreation improvements. These shall be approved by
the Planning, Building and Development Director and shall be recorded with the
final plat with a notation on the plat referring to the documents.
   (I)   Cash contributions.
      (1)   General. In the following situations the county may require the
developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication:
         (a)   A previously established public park is in the immediate
vicinity of the proposed subdivision. The park shall be less than a mile from
the proposed subdivision and shall be accessible by either a sidewalk or a
trail;
         (b)   The subdivision is small and the resulting recreation area is
too small to be practical; or
         (c)   The available land is inappropriate for a recreation area.
      (2)   Criteria. The cash contributions shall be based on the fair market
value of the gross site valued as improved land in the area that otherwise
would have been dedicated as a recreation area.
      (3)   Fees and costs. The cost of all appraisals shall be the
responsibility of the parties submitting them.
      (4)   Determination of fair market value. The fair market value shall be
determined in the following manner:
         (a)   After preliminary plat approval and prior to submission of the
proposed final plat, the developer shall submit to the Planning, Building and
Development Director a statement as to the fair market value of the improved
land in the area and state the evidence or reasons for this.
         (b)   If the Planning, Building and Development Director does not
agree with the statement of fair market value, the Planning, Building and
Development Director shall notify the developer who shall then submit a fair
market value appraisal prepared by a certified appraiser of improved land in
the area of the proposed development. The applicant shall be responsible for
paying all costs of the required appraisal.
         (c)   If the Planning, Building and Development Director does not
agree with the certified appraisal submitted by the applicant, the Planning,
Building and Development Director shall, within 15 days from the receipt of
such, notify the developer of this disagreement in writing. The county shall
then have a fair market value appraisal prepared by a certified appraiser of
the improved land in the area of the proposed development.
         (d)   The final determination of the fair market value per acre of the
improved land shall be made by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee
based upon the information submitted by the developer, any appraisers involved
and from any other sources that may be involved.
      (5)   Administration. Any local public agency that provides recreation
land and facilities may be eligible for the cash contribution. The Planning,
Building and Development Director shall approve of the agency. The cash
contribution shall be held in a special fund by the county or other public body
designated by the county. The fund shall be used to cover only those costs
specifically and uniquely attributable to the subject subdivision.
Specifically, the funds shall be used to purchase recreation land that will
serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of the proposed
subdivision or for the improvement of recreation land existing within one mile
of the proposed subdivision.
      (6)   Expiration. If any portion of a cash contribution is not expended
for the purposes set forth herein within ten years of the date of receipt, it
shall be refunded to the present owner of the property for which the
contribution was made.
   (J)   Criteria for combined land dedication and cash contribution. There may
be situations in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a cash
contribution are necessary. These combinations may be permitted in the
following instances:
      (1)   The local park district indicates that the proposed subdivision
overlaps a proposed park. The portion of the subdivision falling within the
park shall be dedicated as a recreation improvement. The remainder of the
required donation shall be in the form of a cash contribution; or
      (2)   When the Planning, Building and Development Director determines
that due to site design constraints, the entire required land area cannot be
accommodated in the subdivision, the remainder of the required donation shall
be in the form of a cash contribution.

times the assessed valuation of the improvement (based on information obtained
from the Township Assessor) unless the applicant provides replacement valuation
data prepared by a certified appraiser.
      (2)   When assessed valuation data is not available and the subject owner
has not provided appraisal data, the Planning, Building and Development
Director shall be authorized to determine replacement value based on the best
available data.
   (G)   Repairs and maintenance. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of
nonconforming situations shall be permitted unless the repairs increase the
extent of nonconformity or are otherwise expressly prohibited by this chapter.
Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent structures from being
structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in accordance with
an official order of a public official.
   (H)   Tenancy and ownership. The status of a nonconformity is not affected
by changes of tenancy, ownership or management.

§ 151.231 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Definition. A nonconforming use is a use that was legally established
but which no longer complies with the use regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located.
   (B)   Expansion.
      (1)   A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded unless the
expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconforming aspects of the situation.
      (2)   Subsection (B)(1) of this section shall not be construed as
prohibiting additions to any dwelling regardless of the zoning district in
which the dwellings are located, nor shall any provision of this subchapter be
construed as prohibiting the construction of any use that is accessory to a
dwelling unit regardless of the zoning district in which the dwelling is
located.
      (3)   Expansion for the sole purpose of complying with off-street parking
standards of this chapter shall not be considered expansion of a nonconforming
use.
      (4)   No temporary use permit shall be issued for a site containing a
nonconforming use, if the proposed temporary use or event has the potential to
generate additional traffic, noise, or other adverse impacts on the surrounding
area.
   (C)   Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use
other than a use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located.
   (D)   Loss of nonconformity status.
      (1)   Abandonment. If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason for a
period of more than one year, the use shall be considered abandoned. Once
abandoned, the use’s nonconforming status shall be lost and reestablishment of
the use shall be prohibited. Any subsequent use of the property shall comply
with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Damage or destruction. If a structure containing a nonconforming
use is destroyed by disaster to the extent of more than 50% of the replacement
cost of the structure located above the average ground elevation, the use shall
not be reestablished except in compliance with all regulations applicable to
the zoning district in which it is located. Any proposed improvement unrelated
to damage sustained from a disaster may exceed 50% of the replacement cost of
the structure. Replacement cost calculations will consist of the following
process:
         (a)   Submission of complete stamped engineering or architectural
drawings showing an itemized list of all materials involved in the project
(excluding open appliances); and
         (b)   Submission of at least two contractor’s cost estimates based on
the architectural drawings, consisting of labor and all materials. The
Planning, Building and Development Director may waive the above submission
requirement upon a determination that the extent of damage or destruction
appears to be significantly below the 50% threshold based on available
information.
   (E)   Accessory uses. No use that is accessory to a principal nonconforming
use shall continue after the principal use has ceased or terminated.

§ 151.232 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Definition. A nonconforming structure is any building or structure
that was legally established but which no longer complies with any of the
following:
      (1)   The density and dimensional standards of §
151.125; and
      (2)   The floodplain development standards of §
151.147.
   (B)   Use. A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the
underlying zoning district, subject to all applicable standards of §§
151.110 through
151.114.
   (C)   Expansion. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged or expanded if
the expansion does not increase the extent of nonconformity.
 
COMMENTARY:
All building alterations or additions that violate a zoning district
dimensional standard shall be prohibited. This is interpreted, for example, to
mean that no additions, including a second-story addition, will be allowed
within a required setback, except as described in subsection (H)(2) below.
 
   (D)   Moving. A nonconforming structure may be moved if the movement or
relocation eliminates the nonconformity. This provision shall not be
interpreted as prohibiting the elevation of a nonconforming structure for the
purpose of floodproofing or repair.
   (E)   Loss of nonconforming status; damage or destruction. If a
nonconforming structure is destroyed by disaster to the extent of more than 50%
of the replacement cost of the structure located above the average ground
elevation, it may not be reestablished except in compliance with all
regulations applicable to the zoning district in which it is located, or in
compliance with subsection (H) below.
      (1)   Replacement cost calculations will consist of the following
process:
         (a)   Submission of complete stamped engineering or architectural
drawings showing an itemized list of all materials involved in the project
(excluding open appliances);
         (b)   Submission of at least two contractor’s cost estimates based on
the architectural drawings, consisting of labor and all materials. The
Planning, Building and Development Director may waive the above submission
requirement upon a determination that the extent of damage or destruction
appears to be significantly below the 50% threshold based on available
information.
   (F)   Nonconforming structures within floodplains. The owner of a
nonconforming structure that has been removed from a floodplain may apply for a
permit to re-establish the structure outside the floodplain, provided that a
permit application for the re-establishment is submitted within one year of the
date that the structure was demolished. Once a permit has been approved, the
structure must be reestablished before expiration of the permit.
   (G)   Accessory structures. No structure that is accessory to a principal
nonconforming structure shall continue after the principal structure has been
destroyed by disaster to an extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost of
the structure located above the average ground elevation, unless the accessory
structure complies with all applicable regulations of this chapter.
   (H)   Nonconforming single family dwelling and accessory structures.
      (1)   A legal nonconforming single family dwelling or an accessory
structure on a foundation may be restored if deteriorated, damaged, or
destroyed to an extent greater than 50% of the replacement cost of the
structure, provided that the following standards are met:
         (a)   The restored structure does not extend further into any required
setback than the existing structure prior to improvement or rebuilding;
         (b)   The restored structure is located at least ten feet from the
street lot line and at least four feet from the side and rear lot lines;
         (c)   Any proposed improvement unrelated to damage sustained from a
disaster may exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the structure;
         (d)   Any proposed addition or expansion to the existing structure
beyond a repair, remodel, or restoration must meet the setback requirement of
the underlying zoning district or the setback requirement for a nonconforming
lot, whichever applies; and
         (e)   If the structure is located in the floodplain and if the
restoration constitutes “substantial improvement”, the entire structure shall
be brought into conformance with the floodplain provisions of §§
151.145 through
151.154.
      (2)   A legal nonconforming single family dwelling may be allowed a
second story, provided the following standards are met:
         (a)   The second story does not extend further into any required
setback than the existing structure;
         (b)   The existing structure is located at least ten feet from the
street lot line and at least four feet from the side and rear lot lines;
         (c)   The structure complies with the maximum height requirement;
         (d)   If the proposed improvement constitutes “substantial
improvement” (see §
151.271), the water’s edge setback requirement shall apply; or
         (e)   If the structure is located in the floodplain and if the
improvement constitutes “substantial improvement” (see §
151.271), the entire structure shall be brought into conformance with the
floodplain provisions of §§
151.145 through
151.154.
   (I)   Nonconforming multi-dwelling structures. A multi-dwelling structure
that was legally established in accordance with all regulations in effect at
the time of establishment shall not be deemed nonconforming solely due to the
fact that it does not comply with the maximum density standards of this
chapter. If such a structure is destroyed by disaster, it may be rebuilt,
provided that the number of dwelling units does not exceed the number that
existed prior to destruction or the maximum density limit of the subject zoning
district, whichever is greater.
   (J)   Structures rendered nonconforming due to right-of-way acquisition. If
a structure has been rendered nonconforming or made more nonconforming by a
public agency’s acquisition of a portion of the lot upon which the structure is
located, the structure shall have the status of a legal nonconforming
structure. If the structure consists of a single family dwelling and is
subsequently destroyed by disaster, the owner of the single family dwelling may
apply for a permit to reestablish the single family dwelling at the same
location. Upon notice that the single family dwelling has been destroyed by
disaster and that the owner wishes to reestablish the single family dwelling at
the same location, the county shall inform the owner in writing that the permit
application for the reestablishment shall be submitted within one year of the
date of the notification letter. Once a permit has been approved, the single
family dwelling must be reestablished before expiration of the permit. All
other structures shall be subject to the nonconforming structure provisions of
this subchapter.
   (K)   Structures rendered nonconforming due to consolidation. If a structure
is rendered nonconforming or made more nonconforming by consolidation of
parcels required pursuant to this chapter, the structure shall have the status
of a legal nonconforming structure.
   (L)   Structures rendered nonconforming due to rezoning action. If a
structure has been rendered nonconforming or made more nonconforming by a
rezoning action, the structure shall have the status of a legal nonconforming
structure.
(Ord., § 12.3, passed 10-13-2009; Ord. passed 8-14-2012; Ord. passed - - ; Ord.

§ 151.233 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Definition. A nonconforming lot is a tract of land, designated on a
duly recorded subdivision plat, or by a duly recorded deed, or by other lawful
means that complied with the lot area, lot width, and other dimensional
standards of the zoning district in which it was located at the time of its
creation, but that does not comply with the minimum lot area, lot width, or
other dimensional requirement of the zoning district in which it is now
located. If a lot is rendered nonconforming or made more nonconforming by a
public agency’s acquisition of a portion of the lot or by the rezoning of the
lot, the lot shall have the status of a nonconforming lot.
   (B)   Uses.
      (1)   In AG, RE, E, R1–6, and RR Districts, vacant nonconforming lots may
be developed with a detached house, government uses or structures containing no
assembly space, basic utility structures, local food gardens, or ground-mounted
solar energy systems provided that the use complies with the minimum standards
of this section and the requirements of the Lake County Health Department or
other agency providing sewer service.
 
COMMENTARY:
It is the county’s desire to integrate necessary governmental use and
structures and utility structures into unincorporated areas as seamlessly as
possible to avoid potential land use conflicts. To that end, the county
encourages new governmental uses and structures and basic utility structures to
be located on conforming lots already containing the uses or structures. When
this is not possible or practical, a conforming nonresidentially-zoned lot is
the most desirable location. A nonconforming nonresidentially zoned lot or a
conforming residentially-zoned lot is the next most desirable location. The
least desirable location is a nonconforming, residentially-zoned lot.
 
      (2)   In AG, RE, E, R1–R6, and RR Districts, an accessory detached garage
not to exceed 576 square feet in size, underground utilities, or a boathouse
may be constructed at or after the time of issuance of a building permit for a
principal dwelling on a nonconforming parcel under the same ownership on the
opposite side of an alley, easement, or right-of-way. The placement of a new
septic system or an addition to an existing septic system other than the repair
of an existing septic system located on a parcel on the opposite side of an
alley, easement or right-of-way shall require written approval from the highway
authority having jurisdiction over the subject right-of-way and shall require
consolidation through the covenant method as specified in subsection (D)(3)(b)
below.
      (3)   In all other districts, vacant nonconforming lots may be developed
with uses allowed in the underlying zoning district, provided that the uses or
structures containing the uses comply with the minimum standards of this
section and the requirements of the Lake County Health Department or other
agency providing sewer service. If the underlying zoning district allows a
variety of uses or a variety of intensities of uses and one or more uses or
intensities would comply with applicable lot area, lot width or other
dimensional and use standards, while others would not, then only the uses or
intensities that comply with applicable dimensional and use standards shall be
permitted.
   (C)   Dimensional standards. Development on nonconforming lots shall comply
with the dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district, except as
expressly stated in this section.
      (1)   Agricultural and residential zoning districts. The following
dimensional standards shall apply to development on nonconforming lots located
in AG, RE, E, R1–6, or RR Districts.
         (a)   Front setbacks. The minimum front setback shall be 20% of the
lot depth or the underlying zoning district setback, whichever is less. Double-
frontage (through) lots shall maintain a front setback from both streets.
         (b)   Interior side and rear setbacks. The minimum interior side and
rear setback for principal structures shall be four feet or 10% of the lot
width, whichever is greater. This provision shall not be interpreted as
requiring a greater setback than specified for the underling zoning district.
The minimum interior side and rear setbacks for accessory structures shall be
four feet.
         (c)   Street side setbacks. The minimum street side setback shall be
four feet, plus one-half foot of additional setback for each foot lot width
above 28 feet. However, if the Planning, Building and Development Director
determines that the abutting road right-of-way is currently unimproved and is
likely to remain unimproved, the street side setbackshall be the same as an
interior side setback. Setbacks from alleys shall be the same as otherwise
applicable side or rear setbacks. In all cases, structures shall comply with
the intersection visibility standards of §
151.172.
 
COMMENTARY:
Street Side Setbacks
   The minimum street side setback on nonconforming lots is four feet, plus
one-half foot for each foot of lot width above 28 feet.
Examples:
   Lot Width (Ft.)   Minimum Setback (Ft.)
      28      4
      29      4.5
      30      5
      31      5.5
      40      10
      50      15
 
         (d)   Setback from water bodies. All structures except those expressly
exempted in §§
151.125 through
151.132, shall be set back from all water bodies in accordance with §§
151.145 through
151.154.
         (e)   Impervious surface. Lots that are nonconforming due to
insufficient area shall be allowed an impervious surface ratio (ISR) of 0.50,
provided that, for lots located within the Agricultural, Rural Estate, Estate,
and Residential-1 Zoning Districts, in no event shall the impervious surface
exceed the impervious surface threshold for a minimally conforming lot in the
underlying zoning district. The Planning, Building and Development Director may
allow an increase in ISR to a maximum of 0.60 provided an on-site inspection is
conducted to determine that there shall be no adverse impact resulting from
flooding or drainage on the neighboring properties due to increase in
impervious surface. In the event of an anticipated adverse impact, the
Planning, Building and Development Director shall either deny the increase or
shall approve the increase subject to additional engineering requirements and
improvements that will mitigate the impact. All other nonconforming lots shall
comply with the impervious surface requirements of the underlying zoning
district. ISR shall be calculated by dividing the total area of all impervious
surfaces on the site by the site’s base site area.
 
COMMENTARY:
Impervious Surface Threshold for Nonconforming Lots
   The impervious surface for nonconforming lots in the Agricultural, Rural
Estate, Estate and Residential-1 Zoning Districts shall not exceed the
impervious surface threshold for a minimally conforming lot in the underlying
zoning district.
   Examples:
   Zoning District   Impervious Surface Threshold (Sq. Ft.)
      AG, RE      20,000
      E      12,000
      R-1      8,000
 
         (f)   Height.
            1.   The maximum height of principal structures on nonconforming
lots of less than 60 feet in width shall be 30 feet plus one-third foot for
each foot of lot width above 40 feet up to the maximum height allowed in the
underlying zoning district, except in the AG zone or on lots equal to or
greater than 40,000 square feet in area. Accessory structures shall not exceed
12 feet in height at the minimum side and rear setback of four feet.
            2.   For each one foot of additional setback beyond four feet, the
height of the accessory structure may be increased by two feet, to a maximum
height of 20 feet or 25 feet in the AG District.
 
COMMENTARY:
   Height
   Lot Width (Ft.)   Maximum Height (Ft.)
      30      30
      40      30
      45      31 ft., 8 in.
      50      33 ft., 4 in.
      55      35
      60      40
 
         (g)   Floor area of accessory structures. The combined floor area of
all accessory structures on the subject parcel shall not exceed one and one-
half times the floor area of the principal structure on the parcel.
      (2)   Nonresidential zoning districts. The following dimensional
standards shall apply to development on nonconforming lots located in all
zoning districts except AG, RE, E, R1–6, or RR Districts.
         (a)   Front setbacks. The minimum front setback shall be 20% of the
lot depth or the required zoning district setback, whichever is less. In all
cases, the minimum front setback shall be at least ten feet. Double-frontage
(through) lots shall maintain a front setback from both streets.
         (b)   Interior side setbacks. No side setback shall be less than ten
feet unless expressly allowed by the underlying zoning district.
         (c)   Rear setback. Nonconforming lots shall comply with the rear
setback requirements of the underlying zoning district.
         (d)   Street setback. The minimum street side setback shall be four
feet, plus one-half foot of additional setback for each foot of lot width above
28 feet. In all cases, structures shall comply with the intersection visibility
standards of §
151.172.
COMMENTARY:
Street Side Setbacks
   The minimum street side setback on non-conforming lots is four feet, plus
one-half foot for each foot of lot width above 28 feet.
Examples:
Lot Width (Ft.) Minimum Setback (Ft.)
28              4
29              4.5
30              5
31              5.5
40              10
50              15
 
         (e)   Setback from water bodies. All structures except those expressly
exempted in §§
151.125 through
151.132, shall be set back from all water bodies in accordance with §§
151.145 through
151.154.
         (f)   Height, impervious surface, and floor area ratio. Nonconforming
lots shall comply with the height, impervious surface, and floor area ratio
requirements of the underlying zoning district. An accessory structure on a
nonconforming lot that abuts a residential zoning district shall not exceed 12
feet in height at the minimum side and rear setback. For each one foot of
additional setback beyond the minimum required setback, the maximum height of
the accessory structure may be increased by two feet, to a maximum height of 25
feet.
      (3)   Detached house (single family) dwellings. If there is an existing
detached house (single family) dwelling located on a nonconforming lot in a
zoning district other than an AG, RE, E, R1–6, or RR District, any addition to
a principal or accessory building or any new accessory building thereto shall
be governed by the setbacks in subsection (C)(2)(a) above, rather than
subsection (C)(2)(b) above. However, no single family dwelling or accessory
building shall be converted to a nonresidential use permitted in that zoning
district unless it complies with the setback requirements of subsection (C)(2)
(b) above.
   (D)   Development standards for nonconforming recorded lots.
      (1)   Standards. The following standards shall apply to the development
of a single nonconforming lot in platted subdivisions. These standards shall
apply to the establishment of principal or accessory structures.
         (a)   Minimum requirements of the Lake County Health Department for
individual sewage disposal system and individual well shall be met if sewer is
not present.
         (b)   Each lot shall have direct access to an improved street approved
by the relevant highway authority.
         (c)   Drainage improvements consistent with the site development
standards of §§
151.145 through
151.154 shall be met.
      (2)   Consolidation of parcels.  
         (a)   A consolidation of parcels shall be required in the following
instances when it is necessary to use any contiguous nonconforming recorded
parcel(s) held in common ownership:
            1.   For construction of a new principal residential or
nonresidential structure that does not meet the setback from the common parcel
line unless the structure straddles the common parcel line;
            2.   For construction of an addition to an existing residential or
nonresidential structure that will not meet the setback from a common parcel
line unless the structure or addition straddles the same common parcel line;
            3.   For construction of an accessory residential building on the
same parcel on which the principal residential structure exists that will not
meet the setback requirement from the common parcel line unless the existing
principal residential structure straddles the same common parcel line;
            4.   For any new residential or nonresidential construction that
will not meet the impervious surface ratio requirement if the ISR was
calculated only on one parcel; or for any new nonresidential construction that
will not meet the floor area ratio requirement if the FAR was calculated only
on one parcel;
            5.   For construction of any of the following improvements on a
parcel on which the principal residential structure is not located:
               a.   More than one accessory residential building;
               b.   An accessory residential building larger than 576 square
feet in size;
               c.   A new septic system; or
               d.   An addition to an existing septic system.
            6.   For construction of any of the following improvements on a
parcel on which the principal nonresidential structure is not located:
               a.   Any new nonresidential accessory building;
               b.   A new septic system; or
               c.   An addition to an existing septic system.
         (b)   Construction of accessory structures such as decks, porches,
gazebos, pergolas, sheds, ground-mounted solar energy systems, and pools shall
be exempt from the consolidation requirement, provided that these structures
meet the setback requirement from the common lot line.
         (c)   Improvements such as reroofing, residing, electrical upgrades,
interior alterations, installation of exterior air conditioning/heating units,
seawalls, retaining walls, the repair of failing septic systems, driveways, and
fences shall be exempt from the consolidation requirement.
         (d)   The adjustment or movement of a common boundary line between two
or more contiguous parcels under common ownership, consisting of at least one
nonconforming recorded lot, may be accomplished through a consolidation (in
lieu of the lot split subdivision requirements of §
151.186(B)(3)(b)), provided that the adjustment or movement does not increase
the extent of nonconformity of either lot (i.e., the extent of nonconformity
remains the same or decreases for each resulting parcel).
      (3)   Required method of consolidation; covenant.
         (a)   A consolidation of parcels through covenant refers to any
required consolidation within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, of metes
and bounds parcels, not within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, or the
consolidation of one or more metes and bounds parcels with a parcel, located
within the boundaries of a platted subdivision, that has been vacated through a
written vacation instrument in accordance herewith.
         (b)   A consolidation by covenant shall be executed through a signed,
notarized, and recorded covenant on forms available from the Planning, Building
and Development Department.
         (c)   Through the covenant, the applicant shall agree that all parcels
comprising the consolidation of parcels shall remain in common ownership in
perpetuity, and shall henceforth be considered one zoning lot for development
purposes.
         (d)   The covenant would be binding on the applicant’s successors and
assigns.
         (e)   The Planning, Building and Development Director shall have the
authority to approve a consolidation through covenant as contemplated in this
subsection (D)(3) and to execute the written covenant instrument on behalf of
the county.
 
COMMENTARY:
The Lake County Health Department approval is required for individual sewage
disposal systems and individual wells if public sewer and water are not
present. In accordance with §
151.169 , each lot is required to have direct access to an improved, approved
street. Compliance with the requirements of the site development standards of
§§
151.145  through
151.154  is required.

(Ord., § 13.3, passed 10-13-2009)
§ 151.253 REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT POWERS.
   The county shall have the following remedies and enforcement powers:
   (A)   Withhold permit.
      (1)   The Planning, Building and Development Director may deny or
withhold all permits, certificates, or other forms of authorization on any land
or structure or improvements thereon upon which there is an uncorrected
violation of a provision of this chapter or of a condition or qualification of
a permit, certificate, approval, or other authorization previously granted by
the county. This enforcement provision shall apply regardless of whether the
current owner or applicant is responsible for the violation in question.
      (2)   The Planning, Building and Development Director may deny or
withhold all permits, certificates, or other forms of authorization on any land
or structure or improvements owned or being developed by a person who owns,
developed or otherwise caused an uncorrected violation of a provision of this
chapter or of a condition or qualification of a permit, certificate, approval
or other authorization previously granted by the county. This provision shall
apply regardless of whether the property for which the permit or other approval
is sought is the property in violation.
      (3)   The Planning, Building and Development Director may deny or
withhold temporary use permits on any land or structure or improvements owned
or being developed by a person who owns, developed or otherwise caused a
violation of a previous temporary use permit. This provision shall apply
regardless of whether the property for which the temporary use permit sought is
for the property on which the previous violation occurred.
   (B)   Permits approved with conditions. Instead of withholding or denying a
permit or other authorization, the Planning, Building and Development Director
may grant the authorization subject to the condition that the violation be
corrected.
   (C)   Revoke permits. Any development permit or other form of authorization
required under this chapter may be revoked by the Planning, Building and
Development Director when the Planning, Building and Development Director
determines: that there is departure from the plans, specifications, or
conditions as required under terms of the permit; that the development permit
was procured by false representation or was issued by mistake; or that any of
the provisions of this chapter are being violated. Written notice of the
revocation shall be served upon the owner, the owner’s agent or contractor, or
upon any person employed on the building or structure for which the permit was
issued, or shall be posted in a prominent location; and, thereafter, no such
construction shall proceed.
   (D)   Stop work. With or without revoking permits, the Planning, Building
and Development Director may stop work on any building or structure on any land
on which there is an uncorrected violation of a provision of this chapter or of
a permit or other form of authorization issued hereunder.
 
COMMENTARY:
Issuance of a “red tag” or other violation tag constitutes a “stop work order”.
 
   (E)   Revoke plan or other approval. Where a violation of this chapter
involves a failure to comply with approved plans or conditions to which the
approval of the plans was made subject, the Planning, Building and Development
Director may, upon notice to the applicant and other known parties in interest
(including any holders of building permits affected), revoke the plan or other
approval or condition its continuance on strict compliance with this chapter,
the provision of security to ensure that construction is completed in
compliance with approved plans, or any other conditions as the Planning,
Building and Development Director may reasonably impose.
   (F)   Revoke preliminary plat approval. Revocation of preliminary plat
approval may be made by the Planning, Building and Zoning Committee at any time
if it finds that errors or omissions were made on any of the submitted
documents which may significantly affect the design or engineering of the
subdivision or the owner’s legal right to divide the property.
   (G)   Injunctive relief. The county may seek an injunction or other
equitable relief in court to stop any violation of this chapter or of a permit,
certificate, or other form of authorization granted hereunder.
   (H)   The county may enforce violations of this ordinance in accordance with
the Lake County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance (§§
94.50 through
94.66).
   (I)   Forfeiture and confiscation of signs. Any sign installed or placed on
public property, except in compliance with the regulations of §

addition to other remedies and penalties of this section, the county shall have
the right to recover, from the sign owner or person who placed the sign, the
full costs of sign removal and disposal.
   (J)   Abatement. The county may seek a court order in the nature of
mandamus, abatement, injunction, or other action or proceeding to abate or
remove a violation or to otherwise restore the premises in question to the
condition in which they existed prior to the violation.
   (K)   Penalties. The county may seek any other penalties as are provided by
the Lake County Administrative Adjudication Ordinance (§§
94.50 through
94.66) and Illinois law.

emergency or require immediate attention, the Planning, Building and
Development Director shall give notice of the nature of the violation to the
property owner or to any other person who is party to the agreement or to any
applicant for any relevant permit in the manner hereafter stated, after which
the persons receiving notice shall have ten days to correct the violation
before further enforcement action shall be taken.
      (2)   Notice shall be given in person, by U.S. mail, or by posting notice
on the premises. Notices of violation shall state the nature of the violation
and the time period for compliance and may state the corrective steps necessary
and the nature of subsequent penalties and enforcement actions should the
situation not be corrected.
   (B)   Emergency matters. In the case of violations of this chapter that
constitute an emergency situation as a result of safety or public concerns, or
violations that will create increased problems or costs if not remedied
immediately, the county may use the enforcement powers available under this
chapter without prior notice, but the Planning, Building and Development
Director shall attempt to give notice simultaneously with beginning enforcement
action. Notice may be provided to the property owner, to any other person who
is party to the agreement and to applicants for any relevant permit.
   (C)   Appeals. Enforcement actions taken by the Planning, Building and
Development Director may be appealed by the affected party to the Zoning Board

(Ord. 24-0207, passed 3-12-2024)
DEFINITIONS
§ 151.270 USE CATEGORIES.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Basis for classifications. Use categories classify land uses and
activities into use categories based on common functional, product, or physical
characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the
type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered and
site conditions. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning
present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts.
      (2)   Principal uses. Principal uses are assigned to the category that
most closely describes the nature of the principal use. The “characteristics”
subsection of each use category describes the common characteristics of each
principal use.
      (3)   Developments with multiple principal uses. When all principal uses
of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is
assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop,
bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and
service category because all of the development’s principal uses are in that
category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use
categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and
each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category.
      (4)   Accessory uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right in conjunction
with a principal use unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Also, unless
otherwise stated, accessory uses are subject to the same regulations as the
principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as examples in the use category
descriptions.
      (5)   Use of examples. The “examples” subsection of each use category
lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The
names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and
not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls
itself “wholesale warehouse” but that sells mostly to consumers, is included in
the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category.
This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the
retail sales and service category.
   (B)   Similar use interpretations. The standards of this section shall guide
officials in making similar use interpretations.
      (1)   Authority. If an application is submitted for a use type not listed
in §
151.111, the Planning, Building and Development Director shall be authorized to
make a similar use interpretation, based on the following considerations:
         (a)   The actual or projected characteristics of the activity in
relationship to the stated characteristics of each use type;
         (b)   The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment
devoted to the activity;
         (c)   Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
         (d)   The customer type for each activity;
         (e)   The relative number of employees in each activity;
         (f)   Hours of operation;
         (g)   Building and site arrangement;
         (h)   Vehicles used with the activity;
         (i)   The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use;
         (j)   Signs;
         (k)   How the use advertises itself; and
         (l)   Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the
other activities on the site.
      (2)   Use interpretation standards.
         (a)   No similar use interpretation shall allow a use in a zoning
district when that use is a permitted or a conditional use in any other zoning
district.
         (b)   No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning
district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply
with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and
standards of this chapter.
         (c)   No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning
district unless the use is more similar to those uses than to permitted and
conditional uses allowed in other zoning districts.
         (d)   If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a
conditional use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located,
then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a
conditional use permit.
      (3)   Effect of similar use interpretation. No similar use interpretation
finding a particular use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a
specific district shall authorize the establishment of the use or the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required
by the codes and ordinances of the county or other governmental agencies having
jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include but are not limited to
conditional use permits, building permits, and certificates of occupancy.
   (C)   Residential use categories.
      (1)   Household living.
         (a)   Characteristics. Household living is characterized by the
residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. Tenancy is arranged on
a month-to-month or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a
shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered a form of
transient lodging (see the retail sales and service and community service
categories).
         (b)   Accessory uses. Accessory uses commonly associated with
Household Living are recreational activities, raising of pets, hobbies and
parking of the occupants’ vehicles. Home occupations are accessory uses that
are subject to additional regulations.
         (c)   Examples. Examples of household living use (structure) types
include: atrium house, attached dwelling (attached to nonresidential use),
duplex, detached house, lot line house, mobile home park, multi-dwelling
structure, multiplex, patio house, townhouse, twinhouse, and village houses.
         (d)   Exceptions. Lodging in a multi-dwelling structure or where fewer
than two- thirds of the units are rented on a monthly or longer basis is

contrary to normal conditions in the wild; or (d) otherwise unnecessarily
induce significant stress, injury or illness to wildlife as a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of the performance. WILDLIFE EDUCATION includes, but is
not limited to, events to provide the public with opportunities to experience
wildlife directly and vicariously through outreach programs, on-site tours,
demonstrations, and community events. Wildlife educational programming is
typically, but not exclusively, provided by local government agencies, non-
profit organizations that provide rehabilitation and release or sanctuary of
animals, or trained professionals who are actively engaged in conservation and
educational programs and possess the proper permits from the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.

COMMENTARY:
Each development should enhance existing natural resource areas and provide
open space areas. In addition to natural open space areas, it may also be
appropriate to provide formal open space, such as a village square or building
courtyards, as a focal point of the development. All open space areas should
feature amenities such as benches and walkways. Buildings should be oriented to
take advantage of open space views and access.

      (3)   Stormwater management. Stormwater detention shall be provided to
comply with the provisions of §§
151.145 through
151.154 of this chapter.
 
COMMENTARY:
A unified stormwater management system should be designed for the entire
development site. To the greatest extent possible, stormwater conveyance and
storage should utilize the naturally occurring drainage patterns and wetlands.
Detention basins with native wetland vegetation are encouraged; basins with
hard, man-made edges are discouraged. Stormwater management facilities should
comply with best management practices as provided in the Lake County Stormwater
Management Commission’s Technical Reference Manual.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3080.jpg]
 
COMMENTARY:
The stormwater management system should be integrated into the open space and
pedestrian circulation plan. Incorporation of fountains to create water
features is encouraged. Buildings should be oriented to take advantage of views
of attractive water features and wetlands.

   (4)   Access and circulation.
         (a)   Automobile access and circulation. Automobile access and
circulation shall be designed to meet the requirements of the highway authority
having jurisdiction.
            1.   The primary access roads shall be designed as boulevards for a
distance of at least 200 yards from the intersections with Route 173. The
central median shall be planted with a variety of deciduous and evergreen
plantings to ensure year-round foliage. Annuals shall be used to ensure maximum
color during spring, summer, and fall.
            2.   Internal roadways shall be designed to allow circulation
between various buildings and uses within the entire development without
exiting onto Route 173. Roadways shall be designed to minimize conflicts
between automobile and truck traffic.
            3.   An entrance monument shall be provided for both the north and
south primary access roads. The entrance monuments shall be designed to
complement the building architecture and shall be consistent with the signage
and landscaping.
 
COMMENTARY:
Following are guidelines to be considered in designing automobile access:
   a.   The northeast quadrant as defined in Chapter 12 of the Lake County
Regional Framework Plan may have a new access point to Route 173, approximately
centered between the existing Mill Creek Road and I-94. The northeast quadrant
may have one primary access point onto Mill Creek Road and a secondary access
point primarily intended to serve truck traffic to the area designated on the
Conceptual Land Use Map for office/light assembly/warehouse uses.

   b.   The southeast quadrant as defined in Chapter 12 of the Lake County
Regional Framework Plan may have a new access point onto Route 173 directly
parallel to the northeast quadrant access point. The southeast quadrant may also
have one primary access point onto Mill Creek Road. A secondary access point for
truck traffic may also be permitted.
 
         (b)   Pedestrian circulation. Walking paths shall be provided within
and between various uses contained within the overall development through the
provision of sidewalks along internal roadways and/or footpaths through the
open space areas. The sidewalk and footpath network shall be designed to
provide for future possible connections to adjacent developments.
      (5)   Building design. Building design standards, including building
massing, shall be consistent with the architectural standards provided in §
151.171. The following architectural guidelines for buildings are intended to
require development that is compatible in scale and appearance with the
character of the Route 173 Interchange area.
 
COMMENTARY:
A uniform design pallet of building materials, colors, and architectural design should be
applied throughout the entire subject area. Building elements and other uses, such as
vehicle parking, that are incompatible with the surrounding character, should be strictly
screened from view from adjacent properties and roadways, including I-94. Architectural
plans should also incorporate green building design. These guidelines are not all-
inclusive; it may be necessary to address additional design elements during the review of
individual project proposals.

         1.   Building Facades
            All building facades that are visible from adjacent major roadways should be
designed to be aesthetically pleasing. This includes the side and rear facades of
buildings that are visible from Route 173, I-94, and US 41. Aesthetically pleasing design
can be accomplished by employing the same design elements to the side and rear facades
that are often only given to front facades.

         2.   Building Massing
            Big box architecture is discouraged. Large wall expanses (whether long or
tall) should be eliminated through vertical and horizontal articulation (changes so the
wall is not a straight horizontal or vertical line) and the use of architectural
projections, such as porticos, and recesses. Large wall expanses can also be broken
through the use of pilasters, columns, canopies, and windows. Changes in building heights
and rooflines can also be utilized to often the visual impacts of long building walls.
Changes in facade materials and colors can improve the appearance of large buildings, but,
alone these changes are not sufficient to eliminate the visual impacts of large wall
expanses.

3084.jpg]
 
         3.   Building Height
            Building heights should gradually transition from low buildings to tall
buildings. Where necessary, this transition can occur within a single building by
designing the building with a larger, single-story base and a taller (multi-story or high-
ceilinged warehouse) center.

         4.   Building Entrances and Windows
            Building entrances should allow for easy access from parking areas and public
open space. Primary building entrances should be easily identifiable through the use of
design elements such as canopies, porticos, recesses, or archways. Buildings doors and
windows should be pedestrian scaled.

            In addition to providing natural lighting for occupants, windows should be
utilized to soften building appearances, displaying merchandise, and inviting customers
into buildings. Windows should be appropriately sized, arranged, and designed to enhance
the overall appearance of the building. Multi-paned windows, windows with a vertical
orientation, and windows with a well defined frame or sill are preferred.

3086.jpg]

         5.   Facade Materials and Colors
            In order to complement the character of the Route 173 interchange area, the
use of natural building materials and colors is encouraged. Desirable building materials
include brick, terra cotta, and natural stone, such as limestone and river stone. The
exclusive use of synthetic materials, such as EIFS/Drivit, and pre-cast concrete is
discouraged.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/0-0-0-
3088.jpg]

            Building colors should be natural, earth tones. Dark tones should be utilized
at building base and lighter tones for upper levels. The color selection for
architectural elements such as roofs, awnings, cornices, eaves, and sills should
complement the main building color.

         6.   Roof Styles and Materials
            Roof styles can add visual interest to all buildings, but should remain
consistent with the overall building design. Buildings should be designed with a fascia
and cornices that provide a transition between the wall and roof. Arched and pitched
roofs and roof features such as dormers and cupolas are encouraged. Flat rooflines are
discouraged unless part of a green roof design.

         7.   Mechanical and service area screening
            All rooftop mechanical equipment should be visually screened from sight from
all public access areas and adjacent properties and roadways. Ground level mechanical
equipment, trash collection, and loading areas should be appropriately screened from view
from all public access areas and adjacent properties and roadways.
 
      (6)   Lighting standards. Lighting shall comply with the provisions of §§
151.165 through
151.173 of this chapter. Lighting shall ensure the safety and security of
building occupants and customers. A uniform lighting plan shall be designed for
the entire area. Lighting shall be designed and scaled to create an attractive,
friendly pedestrian environment. Pathways shall be lit with low bollard lights.
All light fixtures shall be shielded. All lighting shall be designed to
minimize glare on adjacent properties.
      (7)   Parking. Parking spaces shall be provided for each building in
accordance with the off-street parking standards contained in §§
151.165 through
151.173 of this chapter. Parking shall not be allowed in the required street
setbacks unless otherwise approved as part of the conditional use permit.
Parking areas shall comply with the parking lot landscaping requirements of §§
151.165 through
151.173.
 
COMMENTARY:
Parking lots should be located to the side and rear of buildings, when
possible. Shared parking is encouraged. Parking lots should provide well-
defined walkways that minimize pedestrian-vehicle conflicts. Consideration
should be given to using semi-pervious paving and bio-swales to reduce
stormwater runoff and improve water quality.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3094.jpg]
 
      (8)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage of materials and equipment shall
be prohibited. This storage shall occur within structures unless otherwise
approved as part of the conditional use permit.
      (9)   Sign standards. Signs shall meet the standards provided in §§
151.165 through
151.173 of this chapter, except freestanding signs shall be of a monument type
not exceeding 12 feet in height. Pole signs shall be prohibited.
 
COMMENTARY:
      1.   Sign Massing and Landscaping
         Freestanding signs shall emphasize horizontal rather than vertical massing.
The base of the freestanding sign should be landscaped.

      2.   Sign Composition
         Softer, subtler alternatives to prominent corporate logos should be used.
For multi-tenant buildings and developments, consistent lettering, colors, and sign
designs should be used on all wall signs and monument signs.
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3096.jpg]

      The sign text should consist of no more than two fonts or sizes.
Italicized, bold, and plain text should not be mixed. The use of images,
pictures, and logos should be minimized but, if used, should be simplified in
appearance and integrated into the site’s overall architectural and color
schemes. Solid lettering is preferred over highlighted or accented lettering.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3098.jpg]
 
      3.   Sign Colors
         The sign and any background should together consist of no more than two colors
or shades of the same color. The sign color scheme should match or complement the color
scheme of the building. Primary, white and “day-glo” colors should be avoided.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/0-0-0-
3100.jpg]

      4.   Sign Materials
         Plastic or glass surfaces that result in polished, glossy, shiny, or reflective
sign surfaces should not be used. Wood stone, brick, masonry, or metal materials which
produce matte, natural brushed, patina-like, or burnished surfaces should be used.

      5.   Sign Lighting
         Natural (soft halogen or incandescent) lighting should be used. Over-bright or
fluorescent lighting should be avoided. Internal illumination and protruding overhead
lights or lamps should be avoided. Lighting devices should be hidden or integrated into
architectural features or landscaping. Lighting should be focused and only so bright as
to effectively illuminate the sign surface. For mounted letters, back-lighting should be
used.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/0-0-0-
3102.jpg]

         For freestanding signs, ground-based external lighting should be used. Ground-
based light sources should be concealed within landscaping.
 
      (10)   Landscaping and screening.
         (a)   Landscaping and screening shall meet the standards provided in §
151.167 of this chapter.
         (b)   All development shall contain adequate exterior transition areas
that are bermed and landscaped so as to preclude views of buildings, loading
areas, truck parking lots, and other undesirable views from adjacent uses,
properties, and roadways. For screening purposes, fences may be used in
conjunction with berms and landscaping.
         (c)   Loading docks and truck parking areas shall be screened from
view from all public (customer) access areas, including public access areas on
the same property or development. In order to minimize undesirable views,
loading docks and truck parking areas shall be located back-to-back between
adjacent office, light assembly, and warehouse buildings.
 
COMMENTARY:
The following guidelines should be used to design landscaping. The guidelines are
not all-inclusive; additional landscaping may be required based on new concerns or
changing conditions.

      Desirable views of office and retail buildings should be preserved from
adjacent roadways and properties with compatible uses. Partial views of well-
designed office, light assembly, and warehouse building front facades as well as
side and rear facades that achieve aesthetically pleasing 360-degree design, may be
permissible from adjacent roadways and properties with compatible uses.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/
0-0-0-3104.jpg]
 
      The view of parking lots should be partially obscured or softened through
landscaping, staggered landscaped berms, or preserved natural vegetation. Extensive
area of mowed or manicured turf grass should be avoided.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/0-
0-0-3106.jpg]

      Existing woodlands should be preserved and enhanced. Trees should be planted in
random clusters, rather than straight rows. Like species should be grouped only to
maintain continuity. Formal landscaping should be limited to small areas. Landscape
areas should incorporate a complementary mix of deciduous and evergreen species,
while emphasizing deciduous species.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/IMAGES/0-
0-0-3108.jpg]
 
      Landscaping should cluster varieties of species sizes (canopies
interspersed with understories, bushes, and groundcover), emphasize hardy native
species (limit predominance of non-native or ornamental species), minimize the
use of formal hedges and incorporate groundcover and/or bushes into landscaping,
while limiting the predominance of groundcover and/or bushes.

[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c81a24a434e6c4252c5eee266be767bdd266bca3/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3110.jpg]

      Landscaping should maximize seasonal colors by including perennial flowers
and opportunities for planning annual flowers that bloom in spring, summer, and
fall.

      Earthen berms should undulate naturally and have varying heights and
setbacks. Berms should be landscaped with a variety of plant species, as
otherwise required in these landscaping guidelines. Extensive areas of turf
grass on berms should be avoided.

      At intersections, provide soft massings of landscaping to complement
signage and to provide a focal point, while not impairing visibility of
buildings nor impairing traffic safety. Bike and pedestrian pathways should be
integrated into landscaping to soften visibility, separate from vehicle traffic,
and promote safety.
 
      (11)   Noise. All equipment shall operate in accordance with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency’s nighttime noise regulations (Ill. Adm. Code,
Title 35, Subtitle H, Chapter I). Compliance with the noise standards shall be
measured at the boundary of the subject property.
      (12)   Development calculations. It is the purpose of this provision to
promote the improvement and expansion of I-94 in the county, increase the
accessibility of I-94 to all residents of the county, reduce the public costs
associated with the improvements, and reduce the congestion of the existing I-
94 interchanges and associated roadways by allowing for increased building
intensities at selected suitable locations in exchange for private assistance
in providing the improvements. The projects may not be achievable in a timely
fashion without the private sector participation.
         (a)   Eligibility. Any land lying within GW, Gateway Zoning District
containing area that is required for I-94 purposes by the Tollway Authority may
use these provisions.
         (b)   Standards. For properties abutting I-94 or its ramps, or
containing area required by the Tollway Authority for the installation of new
ramps to I-94 or approaches thereto or for widening of I-94, these provisions
permit the floor area ratio, impervious surface ratio, and density to be
increased in accordance with the following:
            1.   The maximum floor area ratio, impervious surface ratio, and
density specified in this section may be calculated on the entire site prior to
the contribution of land to the Tollway Authority.
            2.   The yard setbacks required by this section shall be measured
from the original property lines as they existed prior to the contribution,
provided no yard shall be reduced to less than 30 feet.
      (13)   Conceptual Land Use Map. A Conceptual Land Use Map is included for
the Gateway Economic Development Area. The map is intended for illustrative
purposes. The most important feature of the map is the preservation of parcels
immediately adjacent to the Route 173 and I-94 interchange for high-quality
office/research development and the preservation of land along the Route 173
and U.S. 41 frontages for retail/services development. The interior portions of
the planning area are designated for office/light assembly/warehouse uses. The
residential use is restricted to the northwest quadrant, away from the
interchange and major arterial streets. Property owners may submit planned unit
development applications that vary from the Conceptual Land Use Map as long as
they are consistent with the intent of the map and uses and development
standards specified in subsection (B) of this section.

      (14)   Procedure for development.
         (a)   Planned unit development. Property owners seeking to zone
property to the GW, Gateway Zoning District or to develop properties within the
GW, Gateway Zoning District shall be required to use the planned unit
development procedure as provided in §
151.051 of this chapter for developing properties. Any modifications to an
approved planned unit development shall be subject to the planned unit
development modification provisions of §
151.051(D). Any change of use to a use of an equal or lesser intensity within
the same use category under the provisions of subsection (B) above shall be
allowed, provided all the use and development standards are met.
         (b)   Nonresidential development. Nonresidential developments shall be
subject to the provisions of §§
151.070 through

Landscape Design and Construction Using Best Management Practices
Goal: To build or improve landscaped environments that provide aesthetic and
functional properties and optimal growing conditions while conserving water and
protecting water quality.
   A.   Planning Guidelines:
      In the planning stages of a project is when the designer is most able to
apply Best Management Practices (BMP). These are factors that will either
contribute to or prevent the successful outcome of reaching the goals of BMP.
Consider the following as elements that will affect the success of the
strategy:
      1.   Consider existing and proposed grades to provide optimal drainage
and infiltration opportunities.
      2.   Exposure to wind and sun can affect water needs, plant health, and
conservation.
      3.   Roads and parking areas can be utilized to provide moderate levels
of infiltration.
      4.   Salt, chemical spray, and snow storage in certain locations will
affect plant health, soils, water quality, and runoff.
      5.   Soils should be understood to be used effectively in water
conservation, erosion potential, and plant health.
      6.   Precipitation amounts and intensity at different sites and regions
will affect design choices and maintenance guidelines.
      7.   Maintenance schedules should be well defined and followed throughout
the year.
      Incorporating elements of ‘Xeriscape’ will aid in the conservation and
protection of water resources, these include:
      1.   Use the planning stage to combine design with resource management.
      2.   Amend poor soils for improved erosion control and growing
conditions.
      3.   Choose plants that require minimal water and hardy growing
conditions
      4.   Minimize turf areas to decrease mowing and fertilizing/herbicide
requirements.
      5.   Apply efficient irrigation practices and monitor during the growing
season.
      6.   Apply and maintain proper mulch.
      7.   Use porous paving materials for walkways, roads, and parking areas.
      8.   Follow a site specific maintenance plan.
   B.   Installation:
      The following principles are suggested to improve the sustainability of
plants in the landscape through design, construction, and into the maintenance
cycle:
      Test soils prior to planting to identify appropriate amendments needed to
improve the soil. Soil tests determine costs associated with amendments and
determine pH, phosphorus, and nitrogen level.
      Improve Soil And Drainage. Due to heavy equipment the soil compaction
frequently reaches 80% to 90%. Break compaction by tilling the soil or replace
it around plants. When the soil has been prepared for planting it is important
to keep construction equipment off of the prepared surface. Plants can often
adapt to dry conditions but plantings on poorly drained sites will be difficult
to maintain and have a shortened life span.
      Typical to Lake County, heavy clay soils have poor aeration that, with
compaction, limits root growth. Typical soil preparation consists of
introducing 3 to 5 cubic yards of organic matter into the soil to a depth of 4
to 6 inches for every 1,000 square feet of area to be seeded, sodded, or
planted. If native plants are used, then soil amendment may not be necessary,
provided that native topsoil has been retained at the site and minimal
compaction has occurred.
      Increase Planting Space. To improve the health of plants, increase areas
of open soil. This will reduce extreme moisture conditions that stress plants
under stress and reduce their life span.
      Properly Size Pits and Provide Optimal Plant Depth. Proper planting with
the root collar at least 2 inches above grade helps with establishment and
long-term health. Additionally, planting pits should be at a minimum 2 times
the width of the root ball.
      Select the Proper Plants. Plants are selected for a function or to
visually enhance a site. Local climate, maintenance, availability, soil
properties, available water, all should be considered in plant selection in
addition to the plant characteristics.
      Inspect the Installation. Many contractor mistakes can be covered with
soil and mulch hiding drainage systems, soil amendments, soil compaction, size
of planting pit, and root balls. These all should be inspected while they are
exposed.
      Follow Maintenance Plan.  All landscapes are dependent on a certain
amount of maintenance. Following a maintenance plan over both the short- and
long-term is crucial for plant health. Planting notes and details must be
reviewed and placed on the landscape plan.
   C.   Maintenance: Tree and Plant Care
      1.   New plantings typically require additional watering for one to two
growing seasons to become established.
      2.   Winter watering is necessary for newly planted trees, particularly
evergreens during periods when snow or rainfall has not occurred over an
extended period of time.
      3.   Many plant root systems, trunks or branches, and drought-stressed
plants are harmed by heavy application of lawn-based herbicides.
      4.   Shrubs and trees should be evaluated yearly and fertilized to
promote healthy roots, branching, and leaf growth.
      Perennial Care
      The following procedures should be observed in order to provide optimal
sustainable growing conditions for perennial planting areas:
      1.   Prepare soil before planting by loosening it to 12 inches. If a
heavy clay or sandy soil is present, add 2 to 3 inches of compost on the soil
surface and then till in to a 12-inch depth.
      2.   Apply 1 to 2 inches of organic mulch between plants to reduce
evaporation and control weeds and soil temperature.
      3.   Fertilizing perennials is generally not needed if proper soil
preparation is done prior to planting. Fertilizer increases growth requiring
additional water.
      4.   Choose plants to match the site conditions and consider plants with
lower water needs.
      5.   Irrigation practices affect root depth. By watering less frequently
and more thoroughly, deeper roots are produced, decreasing irrigation
requirements.
      Turf Management
      Properly maintained turf while visually appealing can also reduce
stormwater runoff rates, sediment and pollutant loads, and reduce heat island
effects. The following BMPs can be used for areas that require turfgrass:
      1.   Avoid placing turf in long narrow areas, steep slopes, or in islands
due to maintenance and irrigation challenges. Consider turf alternatives in
these areas such as native or low-water-use plantings.
      2.   Low grow or no mow turf should be considered where feasible to
reduce the maintenance needs during the growing season.
      3.   Mulch-mowing helps turfgrass develop deeper root systems. Mulched
grass clippings can return 30% of the needed nitrogen that turf requires to be
healthy.
      4.   If thatch is present at a depth greater than 1/2 inch, aerate the
lawn with a core-aerator to allow water infiltration.
      5.   Turf grown on properly prepared soil requires only half of the
recommended rate for irrigation.
      6.   Keep leaves, grass clippings and other turf wastes cleared from
sidewalks and streets to avoid washing into storm drains, streams, and lakes.
      7.   Maintain a buffer zone along waterways where chemicals are not
applied to minimize infiltration of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers
into water bodies.
      8.   Follow a maintenance schedule to prevent stress, disease, and turf
injury.
      Mulching
      Mulch trees, shrubs, and planting beds with partially composted organic
material in a layer of 3 to 4 inches depth in order to:
      1.   Reduce water loss through evaporation;
      2.   Reduce soil erosion and sediment transport;
      3.   Suppress weeds; and
      4.   Provide uniform soil temperature.
      In areas prone to significant runoff, inorganic mulch such as stone
should be considered.

APPENDIX I: PUBLIC BODIES OF WATER IN LAKE COUNTY
The following public bodies of water are navigable in their natural condition
or are improved for navigation and open to public use. The entire length and
surface area in Illinois, including all backwater lakes and sloughs open to the
main channel or body of water at normal flows or stages, are open to the
public:
   1)   Lake Michigan;
   2)   Fox River (Illinois River Basin);
   3)   Fox Chain-O-Lakes (Lake and McHenry Counties): Bluff Lake, Lake
Catherine, Channel Lake, Fox Lake, Grass Lake, Lake Marie, Nippersink Lake,
Dunns Lake, Pistakee Lake, Lake Jerilyn, Lac Louette, and Redhead Lake; and
   4)   The following public bodies of water are navigable waters that are
dedicated to public use. This list is incomplete. It is believed there are
numerous channels and slips in subdivisions on the margins of public bodies of
water that have been dedicated by plat. Additional channels and slips have been
dedicated by common law: Petite Lake and Spring Lake and connecting channels
between Bluff Lake and Fox Lake in Lake County.

HUFF RAINFALL DISTRIBUTIONS
The Huff quartiles represent the typical rainfall distribution for four
different storm duration ranges. The First quartile applies to storms less than
or equal to six hours long. Second is for storms greater than six hours and
less than or equal to 12, while the third Huff quartile is for storms greater
than 12 hours and less than or equal to 24 hours. Fourth quartile storms apply
to storm durations greater than 24 hours.

AGREEMENTS REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER SUBDIVISION CONTRIBUTIONS AND
INDEMNIFICATION
WHEREAS, Lake County, Illinois, on behalf of itself, its officers, employees
and independent contractors (the “County”), through §
151.220 of its Unified Development Ordinance has required that developers make
contributions to government bodies affected by the subdivision improvements;
and
WHEREAS, such contributions may be in land or in money and, when transferred or
paid over to those government bodies, inure in part to the benefit of those
government bodies and not entirely to the direct benefit of the County; and
WHEREAS, from time to time within the County, and within other municipalities,
disputes have arisen regarding the validity and amount of such contributions;
and
WHEREAS, the County is willing, at its discretion, to continue seeking the
contribution of land or money but wishes to procure a commitment from other
government bodies benefitted by the receipt of such contributions that those
government bodies will: (a) acknowledge that the requirement that such
subdivision contributions be made are totally within the discretion of the
County as to their existence, manner and amount; (b) pay the cost of defending
any lawsuit that is filed challenging the appropriate amount of the
contributions, the time at which they are to be made or any other aspect of the
contributions; and (c) comply with the terms of a final and non-appealable
judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction rendered in
connection with the lawsuit; and
WHEREAS, the County is willing, in its discretion, to pay over or require
contributions only to other government bodies that execute this Agreement
annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the payment of money or the transfer of
land to the                                                (“Benefitting
Government”), which the County, from time to time, may within its discretion
cause to be made by developers that are subdividing property, it is agreed
between the County, on behalf of itself and its officers, employees and
independent contractors, and the Benefitting Government as follows:
   1.   The Benefitting Government acknowledges that, except as otherwise
provided in§
151.220 of the Lake County Unified Development Ordinance, the County is not
obligated to cause the payment of money or the transfer of land to the
Benefitting Government. The Benefitting Government recognizes that the County
may, at its sole discretion, amend its ordinances or its practices to
discontinue the payment of subdivision contributions to the Benefitting
Government.
   2.   Legal Representation and Costs:
      A.   In the event a lawsuit is filed against the County and/or the
Benefitting Government by a developer that is subdividing property or any other
person, corporation or entity that challenges the appropriateness, amount,
timing or any other aspect of a subdivision contribution that, pursuant to the
terms of §
151.220 of the Lake County Unified Development Ordinance has been paid or is
due to the Benefitting Government, then the Benefitting Government does agree
to pay the costs and litigation expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
incurred by the County in defending such lawsuit. The costs and expenses shall
be paid by the Benefitting Government when and as incurred by the County but in
no event more than once a month. As a condition precedent to the payment of
these costs and expenses, the County shall submit to the Benefitting Government
copies of the original statements reflecting the costs and expenses, together
with the non-privileged supporting documentation that may be reasonably
requested by the Benefitting Government.
The County covenants and agrees that it shall employ competent and skilled
legal counsel to represent the Benefitting Government and the County, and
further covenants and agrees that it shall keep the Benefitting Government
fully advised as to the progress and status of the litigation. In particular,
the County shall provide to the Benefitting Government copies of all pleadings
filed in the litigation and shall consult regularly (and shall cause its
attorneys to consult regularly) with the Benefitting Government or its
attorneys, as applicable, as to the strategy for defending the lawsuit. In no
event may such litigation be compromised or settled by the County without at
least 30 days’ prior written notice to the Benefitting Government.
      B.   In the event the Benefitting Government decides that it would prefer
to be represented in the litigation by legal counsel of its own choosing, then
the Benefitting Government shall be free to retain its own legal counsel for
that purpose, to intervene in the litigation and to ask the County to terminate
its representation of the Benefitting Government under Section 2 of this
Agreement. The Benefitting Government shall notify the County in writing to
that effect. In that event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect regarding all other provisions of this Agreement, and the Benefitting
Government shall remain liable to the County for all sums that have accrued
under this Agreement up until the date that such written notice is received and
for all sums that remain due and owing from the Benefitting Government to the
County relating to the defense of any lawsuit under the terms of this
Agreement. Further, the County shall be permitted to continue to defend itself
in such lawsuit and notwithstanding the Benefitting Government’s withdrawal
from such representation, the Benefitting Government shall still indemnify the
County for the County’s costs incurred in such defense.
   3.   The Benefitting Government shall further indemnify and hold harmless
the County from any and all liability arising from §
151.220 of the Unified Development Ordinance of Lake, including but not limited
to the general administration and handling of funds required by the County and/
or the Benefitting Government.
   4.   In the event a final and non-appealable judicial determination is made
by a court of competent jurisdiction that contributions of land or money
received by the Benefitting Government are, in whole or in part, excessive, the
Benefitting Government shall promptly repay those contributions to the person
who procures such a judgment, together with all other amounts judged by the
court to be owing from the Benefitting Government. In the event a judicial
determination should require the payment of damages or payment of the
attorneys’ fees of the plaintiff’s attorneys, the Benefitting Government shall
pay all additional amounts.
   5.   In further consideration of the continued authorization by the County
enabling the Benefitting Government to collect the subject contributions of
land or money, the Benefitting Government agrees that its obligations under
this Agreement shall extend to both past and future cash and land
contributions.
   6.   On or before June 1 of each year, the Benefitting Government shall
submit a report to the County describing the manner in which the payments have
been used and provide any additional information the County may require. When
that money turned over to the Benefitting Government is to be used for a
specific purpose or within a specific time period, the report shall address
those issues. If the Benefitting Government should fail to file such a report
with the County, the County may require that any further payments made pursuant
to §
151.220 of the Unified Development Ordinance of Lake County shall be made to
the County and shall delay the payment and distribution of any additional funds
due the Benefitting Government until such time as a full report containing
adequate information is transmitted to the County. The Benefitting Government
understands that it will be asked to execute an indemnity agreement similar to
this agreement on an annual basis and that the County shall not pay or cause to
be paid any additional funds due to the Benefitting Government until such time
as the County is in receipt of such annually executed indemnity agreement.
   7.   This Agreement shall be terminable by either party for any reason or no
reason at all upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the other party evidencing
the intention to so terminate this Agreement. But the termination of this
Agreement shall not affect the continuing obligation of the Benefitting
Government or the County with regard to claims or damages allegedly arising out
of the County’s efforts prior to termination to impose, collect or distribute
contributions, or to the actual distribution of subdivision contributions.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND COUNTY TO DELAY PAYMENT OF CASH CONTRIBUTIONS
This agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Lake County (the “County”)
and                             , (“Developer”).
WHEREAS, the County has approved a final plat of subdivision or a final plat of
a planned development at the request of Developer for the real estate legally
described in Appendix       .1 attached hereto and made a part hereof (the
“Land”). Accordingly, pursuant to §
151.220 of the Unified Development Ordinance of Lake County (“Ordinance”),
certain cash contributions for school lands are immediately due the County (or
affected school districts )from the Developer; and
WHEREAS, Developer has, however, requested that the payment of the aforesaid
cash contributions be delayed and that the same become due and payable on a per
dwelling unit basis at the time the County issues a building permit for the
particular dwelling unit.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the County agreeing to delay the
collection of the cash contributions, Developer hereby agrees as follows:
   1.   The amount of cash contributions owed shall be calculated based upon
the Ordinance, or as provided for in such other future ordinance amending or
replacing the Ordinance, which is in effect at the time of the issuance of a
building permit; and
   2.   Notwithstanding any present or future law, regulation and/or legal
precedent to the contrary, the unit of local government that is the ultimate
recipient of the subject cash contributions may expend such contributions for
any of the following purposes intended to serve immediate or future needs of
the residents and children of the Developer’s subdivision or planned
development: (a) for the acquisition of land; (b) for site improvements such
as, by way of example, streets, curbs, gutters, stormwater control, and utility
extensions; (c) for construction of capital facilities, including, by way of
example, new buildings and structures, and the expansion or enhancement of
existing buildings and structures; and (d) for so-called soft costs directly
related to the foregoing items (b) or (c) such as architectural and engineering
costs.
   3.   Developer has reviewed the Ordinance regarding the dedication of school
sites or cash contributions in lieu thereof, as well as all of the methodology,
formulae, calculations, projections, assumptions, numbers and other factors
used to arrive at the land dedication requirements or cash contributions in
lieu thereof that are the subject of this Agreement (hereinafter referred to as
the “Ordinance and Attendant Calculations”) and hereby acknowledges and agrees
that:
      (a)   Pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance, Developer has been offered
the opportunity to raise in a hearing before the County, any objections
relating to acreage requirements, presumptions as to fair market value, the
Density Formula, or any other application of the Ordinance; Developer has not
raised such objections; Developer has thereby waived the right to assert those
objections;
      (b)   Developer hereby waives any future right to object to or to
institute any legal action regarding the Ordinance and Attendant Calculations;
and
      (c)   Developer hereby acknowledges that the Ordinance and Attendant
Calculations have been properly passed, calculated, and imposed.
   4.   This Agreement constitutes a covenant that is appurtenant to and runs
with the land. Either this Agreement or a memorandum thereof may be recorded
against legal title to the land by either party hereto; provided, however, it
shall be a condition of the County’s issuance of the first building permit for
a dwelling unit on the land that Developer shall provide satisfactory evidence
to the County that this Agreement or a memorandum thereof has been recorded
against legal title to the land.
   5.   Developer represents and warrants to the County that it is the sole
holder of record fee title to the Land.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the County and the Developer have caused this Agreement to
be duly authorized, executed and entered into as of the
                         day of                                 , 20     .

AGREEMENTS REGARDING THE RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER SUBDIVISION CONTRIBUTIONS AND
INDEMNIFICATION, IN THE EVENT OF A PRIVATE AGREEMENT
   WHEREAS, Lake County, Illinois, on behalf of itself, its officers, employees
and independent contractors (the “County”), through §
151.220 of its Unified Development Ordinance has required that developers make
contributions to government bodies affected by the subdivision improvements;
and
   WHEREAS, those government bodies may instead elect to execute a private
agreement with developers regarding the contribution of land or money; and
   WHEREAS, from time to time within the County, and within other
municipalities, disputes have arisen regarding the validity and amount of such
contributions; and
   WHEREAS, the County is willing to permit private agreements between
government bodies and developers for the contribution of school land or money
but wishes to procure a commitment from such other governmental bodies
benefitted by the receipt of such contributions that those government bodies
will: (a) acknowledge that the requirement by the County of proof of payment
for such contributions to such governmental bodies is totally within the
discretion of the County; (b) acknowledge that the requirement by the County of
proof of payment for such contributions to such governmental bodies does not
render the County a party to such private agreements and does not render the
County responsible or liable for the terms of such private agreements for any
reason, including but not limited to the extent that such private agreements
provide for contributions beyond what is authorized by the contribution
requirements of §
151.220 of the Lake County Unified Development Ordinance; (c) pay the cost of
defending any lawsuit that is filed against the County challenging the
appropriate amount of the contributions, the time at which they are to be made,
the withholding of County building permits in the absence of proof of payment
for such contributions, or any other aspect of the contributions; and (d)
comply with the terms of a final and non-appealable judicial determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction rendered in connection with the lawsuit; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration for the payment of money or the transfer of
land to the                                                    (“Benefitting
Government”), which the County has authorized to be effectuated via private
agreement in accordance with the Lake County Unified Development Ordinance, it
is agreed between the County, on behalf of itself and its officers, employees
and independent contractors, and the Benefitting Government as follows:
   1.   Legal Representation and Costs:
      A.   In the event a lawsuit is filed against the County and/or the
Benefitting Government by a developer that is subdividing property or any other
person, corporation, or entity that challenges the appropriateness, amount,
timing, the withholding of County building permits in the absence of proof of
payment of private school contributions by the developer, or any other aspect
of a subdivision contribution that, pursuant to a private agreement between the
Benefitting Government and the developer, has been paid or is due to the
Benefitting Government, then the Benefitting Government does agree to pay the
costs and litigation expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred
by the County in defending such lawsuit. The costs and expenses shall be paid
by the Benefitting Government when and as incurred by the County but in no
event more than once a month. As a condition precedent to the payment of these
costs and expenses, the County shall submit to the Benefitting Government
copies of the original statements reflecting the costs and expenses, together
with the non-privileged supporting documentation that may be reasonably
requested by the Benefitting Government.
      B.   The County covenants and agrees that it shall employ competent and
skilled legal counsel to represent the Benefitting Government and the County,
and further covenants and agrees that it shall keep the Benefitting Government
fully advised as to the progress and status of the litigation. In particular,
the County shall provide to the Benefitting Government copies of all pleadings
filed in the litigation and shall consult regularly (and shall cause its
attorneys to consult regularly) with the Benefitting Government or its
attorneys, as applicable, as to the strategy for defending the lawsuit. In no
event may such litigation be compromised or settled by the County without at
least 30 days’ prior written notice to the Benefitting Government.
      C.   In the event the Benefitting Government decides that it would prefer
to be represented in the litigation by legal counsel of its own choosing, then
the Benefitting Government shall be free to retain its own legal counsel for
that purpose, to intervene in the litigation and to ask the County to terminate
its representation of the Benefitting Government under Section 2 of this
Agreement. The Benefitting Government shall notify the County in writing to
that effect. In that event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect regarding all other provisions of this Agreement, and the Benefitting
Government shall remain liable to the County for all sums that have accrued
under this Agreement up until the date that such written notice is received and
for all sums that remain due and owing from the Benefitting Government to the
County relating to the defense of any lawsuit under the terms of this
Agreement. Further, the County shall be permitted to continue to defend itself
in such lawsuit and notwithstanding the Benefitting Government’s withdrawal
from such representation, the Benefitting Government shall still indemnify the
County for the County’s costs incurred in such defense.
   2.   The Benefitting Government shall indemnify and hold harmless the County
from any and all liability arising from the County’s withholding of building
permits in the absence of proof of payment by the developer of contributions
pursuant to the terms of a private agreement reached between the Benefitting
Government and the developer.
   3.   In the event a judicial determination should require the payment of
damages or payment of the attorneys’ fees of the plaintiff’s attorneys, the
Benefitting Government shall pay all additional amounts.
   4.   In further consideration of the continued authorization by the County
enabling the Benefitting Government to collect the subject contributions of
land or money, the Benefitting Government agrees that its obligations under
this Agreement shall extend to both past and future cash and land
contributions.
   5.   The Benefitting Government understands that it will be asked to execute
an indemnity agreement similar to this agreement on an annual basis, on or
before June 1 of each subsequent year and that the County shall not exercise
any rights it might have to withhold the issuance of building permits in the
absence of proof of payment or to require proof of payment of contributions by

APPENDIX S: UNIFIED DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS
AND GUIDELINES FOR ISOLATED WATERS OF LAKE COUNTY IMPACTS
INTRODUCTION
   This Appendix contains the minimum requirements and guidelines for
preparation of a Project Mitigation Document (PMD) related to the creation or
enhancement of wetlands on a development site, or on an offsite property, to
meet the mitigation provisions in§
151.146(M)(4). These provisions do not apply for Category IV impacts to
Isolated Waters of Lake County. The PMD shall provide at a minimum, information
needed by Lake County Planning Building & Development (PB&D) to evaluate the
appropriateness and enforceability of a proposed mitigation plan. Additional
requirements may apply for impacts to Waters of the United States, as
determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. For the purposes of this
Appendix, the term mitigation site refers to the ownership parcel where the
mitigation is to occur. Mitigation area refers to the location within the
mitigation site where the actual mitigation will occur.
   Each PMD shall include specific information in a standard format as outlined
in Table 1 and described in Sections A-K below.

J       Reports
K       Compliance and Completion
 
A.   MITIGATION GOALS
      1.   Discuss how the wetland mitigation shall duplicate or improve the
hydrologic and biologic features of the impacted wetlands. Describe the
specific functions of the wetlands to be created or enhanced versus the
functions of the wetlands to be impacted.
      2.   Describe the acreage and vegetative community type of wetlands and
wetland buffers to be created or enhanced to meet the minimum mitigation ratios
required in §
151.146(M)(4)(b). Mitigation acreage shall be credited on the following basis:
         a.   100% for each acre of wetland created or restored. For the
purposes of this Appendix, wetland creation includes restoration of historic
wetlands which have been filled, drained, or otherwise manipulated to the
extent the areas no longer exhibit wetland characteristics. Open water creation
shall be credited at 100% for in-kind mitigation (e.g., one acre of open water
created for one acre of open water impacted). No mitigation credit shall be
given for open water creation to compensate for non-open water impacts.
         b.   25% for each acre of non-farmed wetland enhanced after a minimum
ratio of 1:1 for wetland creation to wetland impact is achieved.
         c.   Enhancement of farmed wetlands meeting the size criterion in§
151.146(M)(5)(a) may be used for up to 80% of the total mitigation requirement
(e.g., if 2.0 acres of mitigation are required, up to 1.6 acres may be credited
for farmed wetland enhancement, as long as the size criterion above is met).
         d.   Enhanced upland areas or enhanced wetland edges used to meet the
buffer requirements in §
151.146(H)(5) shall be credited at 25% for each acre enhanced. Created or
restored wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements of this Ordinance
shall be credited at 75% for each acre created or restored. All high-quality
aquatic resources existing on the mitigation site shall, at a minimum, meet the
buffer requirements for high-quality aquatic resources; all other existing
enhanced, created or restored wetland areas shall, at a minimum, meet the non-
high-quality aquatic resource buffer requirements of this Ordinance.
B.   MITIGATION SITE INFORMATION
      1.   Site Location. Identify the mitigation site on a general location
map (USGS quadrangle map preferred), plat of survey, and major watershed map
(e.g., Fox River Watershed).
      2.   Physical Description. Describe the physical characteristics of the
mitigation area. Provide information to support the mitigation site selection,
including, but not limited to: wetland determination report meeting the
requirements in §
151.146(M)(3), NRCS certified wetland determination (for agricultural land),
topographic map with a minimum of 2-foot contour lines, recent and historic
aerial photographs, current site photographs, drain tile information, USGS
hydrologic atlas, FEMA flood insurance rate map and base flood elevations as
required by this Ordinance, and NRCS soil survey map and soil unit
descriptions.
      3.   Land Use. Describe the past and current land use(s) of the
mitigation site parcel. Submit a plan at a minimum scale of 1 in.=100 ft.
showing the existing land use(s) and pertinent features, such as buildings,
roads, utility lines, drain tiles, culverts, landscaping, lot lines, etc.
Include on the plan or provide a narrative of any adjacent land uses that could
conflict with the mitigation proposal and any zoning restrictions. Discuss
potential adverse impacts to the mitigation site, including stormwater runoff
from adjacent properties or nearby development in the watershed. Include a copy
of the current zoning map and comprehensive land plan showing proposed land use
(s), roads and trail systems.
      4.   Ownership. Identify the current owner(s) of the mitigation site
property. If the owner is different from the permittee, provide PB&D with a
copy of an executed agreement between the owner(s) and permittee that grants
permission by the owner(s) for the permittee to use the property for mitigation
and specifies the responsibilities of each party for establishment of the
mitigation site. Once mitigation is in place, the permittee shall notify PB&D
of any change in ownership. The new owner(s) shall provide written assurance to
the issuer of the SDP of the transfer of the permit and intent to comply with
the terms and conditions of the permit, specifically the mitigation plan.
      5.   Significant Biological Resources. The permittee shall consult with
the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and the U.S. Fish &
Wildlife Service (USFWS) regarding the possible presence of threatened or
endangered species or critical habitat on the mitigation site. PB&D shall not
approve the mitigation area until documentation is provided confirming the
proposed mitigation area is in compliance with the IDNR’s Endangered Species
Consultation Program and the Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act [520 ILCS
10/11 and 525 ILCS 30/17] and the USFWS’ consultation program under the federal
Endangered Species Act.
C.   MITIGATION DESIGN
      1.   Topography. If grading is proposed, submit a grading plan at a
minimum scale of 1 in.=100 ft. showing existing and proposed grades with a
minimum of 1-foot contour lines. Identify elevation and location of reference
benchmarks. Include cross-sections for the mitigation wetlands with normal
water level (NWL) and high water level (HWL) depicted, if applicable.
      2.   Hydrology.
      Identify the source(s) of water for the mitigation wetlands, both surface
and subsurface. Describe any water control structures to be used and identify
these structures on the grading plan, with invert elevations. Control
structures with adjustable inverts are recommended to facilitate management of
desired water levels in the mitigation wetlands. Describe the expected
hydrologic regime of the mitigation wetlands.
      Provide hydrologic modeling results in both summary table and hydrograph
form for the 2-year and 100-year, 24 hour storm events, at a minimum, to
support the expected hydrologic regime of the mitigation wetlands. Verify that
the mitigation design will not adversely impact the hydrology of existing on-
site or nearby wetlands.
      Discuss factors influencing the quality of stormwater runoff from on-site
and off-site sources (e.g., roads, lawns, parking lots, etc.) and incorporate
best management practices (BMPs) into the design to treat runoff before it
discharges into the wetlands. Identify the BMPs on the grading plan.
      Stormwater detention basins shall not be used for creation of wetlands to
meet the wetland mitigation requirements of this Ordinance in§
151.146(M)(4).
      3.   Soils.
      A minimum of twelve (12) inches of suitable rooting medium shall be
provided on the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffer areas. Use low ground
pressure equipment to minimize soil compaction, include information about
whether topsoil will be imported from off-site.
      If the mitigation site contains a drained hydric soil, include the NRCS
soil map unit description and describe the drainage system (e.g., drain tile,
ditches, channels, etc.). The drainage system shall be shown on the grading
plan. Verify the hydric soil map unit by digging a 30-inch deep soil pit in a
representative location of the map unit and write a detailed profile
description of the soil, including horizons, soil colors using Munsell color
charts, and soil texture and structure. Examine the soil profile for the
presence of redoximorphic features such as iron/manganese accumulations,
oxidized rhizospheres, mottles, and depleted zones. Record the type, relative
abundance, location, and color of these features. Record other evidence of soil
wetness such as the accumulation of partially decomposed organic matter at the
soil surface.
      4.   Planting Plan. Submit a plan at a minimum scale of 1 in.=100 ft.
depicting the location and acreage of each wetland and wetland buffer community
type to be established. This plan shall also be used as the base map to show
the locations of the vegetation monitoring transects and hydrology sampling
points discussed in Appendix S, Section I. Provide the list of plants to be
established in community by common and scientific name, along with the seeding
or planting rate for each species. Seed and plant stock source(s) shall
originate from within 150 miles of the mitigation site to maintain local
genotypes.
D.   DEED OR PLAT RESTRICTION
   All mitigation wetlands, as well as other preserved wetlands or waters and
wetland buffers on the mitigation site, shall be protected in perpetuity by a
deed or plat restriction. The permittee shall provide PB&D with a draft copy of
the proposed deed or plat restriction document and associated exhibit(s)
showing the restricted areas for approval. Contact PB&D for example wetland and
wetland buffer restrictive language.
E.   CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE
   Provide a schedule with anticipated start date and duration for each phase
of the mitigation site construction, including installation of soil erosion and
sediment control measures, earthwork, and planting.
F.   FINANCIAL ASSURANCE
   The permittee shall provide PB&D with a financial surety for 110% of the
total estimated cost for construction, monitoring, and management of the
mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers. The amount of the financial surety
shall be based upon the wetland consultant’s detailed cost estimate for
completing the approved mitigation plan, including earthwork, planting, and
monitoring and management for a minimum of five (5) full growing seasons after
planting is completed. The cost estimate shall be provided to PB&D for approval
prior to obtaining the financial surety. The financial surety may be in the
form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, irrevocable trust,
escrow account, casualty insurance, or other approved surety.
   The financial surety shall be held by PB&D until the mitigation site meets
the performance standards in Section H. Such surety may be phased out or
reduced by PB&D once it has been demonstrated that the mitigation site is
functionally mature and/or self-sustaining in accordance with the performance
standards in Section H.
G.   AS-BUILT PLANS
      1.   Upon the completion of earthwork, but prior to planting, the
permittee shall provide an as-built topographic map to PB&D for approval. The
as-built map shall depict the constructed grades at a minimum of 2-ft contour
intervals, along with spot elevations, and the invert elevations of all water
control structures. The bench mark(s) used to establish the grades shall also
be indicated on the plan. If the constructed grades and invert elevations are
not in conformance with the approved grading and utility plan, the permittee
shall be responsible for regrading or reinstalling the water control structures
at the designed elevations to comply with the approved plan. If the as-built
plan and site inspection are determined to be in conformance with the approved
design, PB&D shall issue a written approval of the as-built plan and planting
activities may commence.
      2.   Upon the completion of planting activities, the permittee shall
provide PB&D with lists of the species actually planted in the mitigation
wetlands and wetland buffers, including the common and scientific name of each
species, the quantity of each species planted (e.g., weight of seeds/acre,
number of plugged plants/acre), the source of the seeds/plants, the planting
method(s) used, and the date(s) seeding or planting occurred.
H.   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
   Performance standards are predetermined goals for guiding and measuring
mitigation success.
      1.   Performance Period. The performance period shall consist of a
minimum five (5) years at which time the vegetation performance standards are
met, unless the vegetation performance standards can be met earlier for two (2)
consecutive growing seasons, at which time the performance period shall be
considered complete. Conversely, the performance period may be required to be
longer than five (5) years in order to meet the vegetation performance
standards if they haven’t been met after the standard five-year time frame.
      2.   Wetland Vegetation Performance Standards. The performance standards
below apply to emergent, wet prairie and sedge meadow communities. If other
community types are proposed (e.g., aquatic, forest, etc.), the permittee shall
submit proposed performance standards for each community to PB&D for approval.
         a.   Floristic Quality. By the end of the performance period, a native
mean coefficient of conservatism value (native mean C value) of greater than or
equal to 3.5 and a native floristic quality index value (FQI) of greater than
or equal to 20 shall be achieved for each wetland community as determined using
the Chicago Region Floristic Quality Assessment Calculator (U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, Chicago District, most recent version).
         b.   Mean Wetness Coefficient. By the end of the performance period,
the mean wetness coefficient (mean W) shall be less than or equal to 0 in each
wetland community. Wetness coefficients are listed below, based on the category
of each plant species designated in the National Wetland Plant List—Midwest
Regional Plant List (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, most recent version. The
mean W for each wetland community is calculated by the following equation: Sum
of wetness coefficients for all species/number of species.
 
Wetness Coefficients
National Wetland Category  Wetness Coefficient
Obligate (OBL)             -2
Facultative Wetland (FACW) -1
Facultative (FAC)          0
Facultative Upland (FACU)  1
Upland (UPL)               2
 
         c.   Vegetative Cover. By the end of the performance period, no area
greater than ten (10) square feet within the created or enhanced wetlands shall
be devoid of vegetation, as measured by percent areal coverage. Areas not
meeting this standard shall be re-planted.
         d.   Invasive Species Dominance. By the end of the performance period,
none of the three dominant plant species in the emergent, wet prairie, or sedge
meadow communities shall be non-native or weedy species, including, but not
limited to, the following species: Typha spp., Phragmites australis, Poa
compressa, Poa pratensis, Lythrum salicaria, Salix interior, Echinochloa
crusgalli, or Phalaris arundinacea. Dominance shall be based on the relative
importance value (RIV) of each species, which is calculated by the following
equation: Invasive Species Dominance:
         RIVs = [RFs + RCs] / 2 x 100, where:
         RIVs is the relative importance value of the individual species in the
community,
         RFs is the frequency of the individual species occurring in all
quadrats/the total frequency of all species (adventive and native) occurring in
all quadrats, and
         RCs is the coverage of the individual species occurring in all
quadrats/the total coverage of all species (adventive and native) occurring in
all quadrats.
      3.   Wetland Buffer Vegetation Performance Standards. The performance
standards below apply to the prairie community to achieve mitigation credit. If
other community types are proposed for the wetland buffers (e.g., forest,
savanna, etc.), the permittee shall submit proposed performance standards for
each community to PB&D for approval.
         a.   Floristic Quality. By the end of the performance period, a native
mean coefficient of conservatism value (native mean C value) of greater than or
equal to 2.5 and a native floristic quality index value (FQI) of greater than
or equal to 15 shall be achieved for the buffer as determined using the Chicago
Region Floristic Quality Assessment Calculator (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Chicago District, most recent version).
         b.   Vegetative Cover. By the end of the performance period, no area
greater than ten (10) square feet within the created or enhanced mesic prairie
buffers shall be devoid of vegetation, as measured by percent areal coverage.
Areas not meeting this standard shall be re-planted.
         c.   Invasive Species Dominance. By the end of the performance period,
none of the three dominant plant species in the mesic prairie buffer community
shall be non-native or weedy species, including, but not limited to, the
following species: Cirsium arvense, Melilotus spp., Aliiaria petiolata, Poa
compressa, Poa pratensis, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, or Rhamnus cathartica and R.
franguia. Dominance shall be based on the relative importance value (RIV) of
each species, which is calculated using the equation in Section H.2.d.
I.   MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT
      1.   Monitoring.
         a.   Monitoring Plan. The PMD shall contain a proposed five-year
monitoring plan. Such plan shall include, at a minimum, a description of the
sampling methodologies to be followed for evaluating hydrology in the
mitigation wetlands and assessing vegetation in the mitigation wetlands and
buffers, the frequency of sampling, and the report(s) to be generated.
         b.   Vegetation Monitoring. A sufficient number of straight-line
sampling transects shall be established in the mitigation wetlands and wetland
buffers to achieve a representative amount of plant frequency and coverage
data. The beginning and end points of each transect shall be monumented in the
field with a metal stake. The location of each transect and the number of
proposed quadrats per transect shall be accurately identified on the Planting
Plan (Section C.4.), which shall be included in the annual monitoring reports.
Each transect shall consist of a series of sample quadrats either 0.25 or 1.0
square meter in size. Vegetation sampling shall be conducted by, or under the
supervision of, a Certified Wetland Specialist twice during the growing season
with at least one month between sampling dates (e.g., May/June and August/
September). Vegetation sampling shall include the following, at a minimum:
            (1)   Record the number and estimated percent areal coverage of
each vascular plant species in each quadrant, including all non-native
(adventive) taxa and native taxa. Use this data to perform the calculations in
(2)-(4) below, Photograph each end of the transect at the time of sampling,
            (2)   Calculate the native mean C value, FQI, and mean wetness
coefficient for each quadrat,
            (3)   Calculate native mean C value, and native FQI and mean
wetness coefficient for each transect,
            (4)   Calculate the RIVn of total native species by the following
equation:
            RIVn = [RFn + RCn] / 2 x 100, where:
            RIVn is the relative importance value of the total native species
in the community,
            RFn is the total frequency of the native species occurring in all
quadrats/the total frequency of all species (adventive and native) occurring in
all quadrats, and
            RCn is the total coverage of the native species occurring in all
quadrats/the total coverage of all species (adventive and native) occurring in
all quadrats.
         c.   Hydrology Monitoring. A sufficient number of representative
sample points shall be established in each mitigation wetland to assess the
hydrologic conditions. The sample points shall be monumented in the field with
a metal stake. The location of each sample point shall be accurately identified
on the Planting Plan (Section C.4.), which shall be included in the annual
monitoring reports. At a minimum, hydrology monitoring shall be conducted on a
bi-weekly basis during the first growing season and on a monthly basis during
each succeeding growing season of the monitoring period. Hydrology sampling
shall include the following, at a minimum:
            (1)   Depth of inundation (in. or cm.) based on NAVD 88 datum,
which superseded the NGVD 29 datum used prior to September 18, 2013, and
            (2)   Soil moisture condition to a minimum depth of 12 in. (e.g.,
saturated, moist, dry).
      2.   Management.
         a.   Management Plan. The PMD shall contain a proposed five-year
management plan. Such plan shall include a description of the anticipated
management practices to be employed each year to meet the performance standards
in Section H., and a schedule of all proposed management practices (i.e., a
calendar indicating month and year of activity). In addition, the plan shall
identify the entity to assume responsibility for long-term management of the
mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers after the performance period and the
dedicated source of funding for long-term management. At completion of the
performance period, PB&D shall require a written agreement between the
permittee and the entity identified for long-term management.
         b.   Management Practices. Describe the methods and equipment to be
used for each proposed management practice (e.g., prescribed burning, control
of invasive plant species by herbicide application or hand removal, mow
management, etc.). List all permits or certifications/licenses required for the
proposed management practices (e.g., IEPA open burn permit, local fire
department permits, IDOA herbicide applicators license, etc.). Personnel who
perform the management activities shall have appropriate licenses and
qualifications.
J.   REPORTS
   At a minimum, an annual report prepared by, or under the supervision of, a
Certified Wetland Specialist summarizing the results of the previous year’s
monitoring data shall be submitted to the PB&D by January 31st of the following
year. The annual reports shall contain, at a minimum:
      1.   A narrative summary of the vegetation and hydrology monitoring data;

* Follow-up sampling is required within 30 to 60 days when any parameter fails
to meet its effluent limitation. Sampling must continue bi-monthly after that
until the relevant effluent limitation is met or until follow-up inspections
to adjust the chlorine delivery system to meet the benchmark range.
** TRC values indicate a non-regulatory benchmark range. Failure to meet
benchmark range values does not indicate a violation, but rather a need by the
owner of record to conduct Discharging Wastewater Treatment Systems from the
United States Environmental Protection Agency as incorporated in

Footnotes:
1- For separation distances to closed loop wells see 77 111. Adm. Code 920.180
2- A building sewer may be located to within 10 feet of a well or suction line
from the pump to the well when cast iron pipe with mechanical joints or
Schedule 40 PVC pipe with watertight joints is used for the building sewer. A
force main may be located to within 10 feet of a well or suction line from the
pump to the well when Schedule 40 PVC pipe with watertight joints is used.
3- The distance to the upslope edge of the basal area of a Type 3, 4 and 5
system can be reduced by 50% on sites where the soil treatment area is on a
slope of 2% or greater.
4- This distance can be reduced by 50% if the soil treatment area is the edge
of a trench/bed (System Type 1 or 2), drip tubing, or upslope or sideslope side
of a soil treatment area.
5- Large Capacity Septic Systems, which are classified as Class V Injection
Wells, are described and defined in the Illinois Pollution Control Board rules.
They are typically a shallow well used to place fluids below the land surface.
See 35111. Adm. Code 704.105, 704.106 and 704.280.
6- This distance can be reduced to 25 feet with NSF/ANSI Standard Number 350
effluent for the OWTS owner’s private well.
7- This distance can be reduced 50% when the building is not a habitable
structure.

deliver the animal within 24 hours to a licensed veterinarian for confinement
and rabies observation. The confinement and observation shall be for a period
of not less than ten days from the date the bite occurred, and shall continue

in this chapter. The confinement and observation shall be for a period of not
less than ten days from the date the bite occurred, and shall continue until
the animal has been examined and released from confinement by a licensed
veterinarian. Within 24 hours after the end of confinement and observation
period, the licensed veterinarian shall report to the Health Officer the
disposition of the animal on forms provided by the Health Officer. If the
biting animal escapes from home confinement during the ten-day confinement
period, the owner shall immediately apprehend it and deliver it to a licensed
veterinarian for hospital confinement and observation, at the expense of the
owner, for the remainder of the confinement and observation period. An owner of
a biting animal is responsible for all costs associated with its confinement
and observation.
      (3)   Unowned dogs and cats. A biting dog or cat that is not owned shall
be subject to the confinement and observation requirements of this chapter,
with the exception of the provisions of §
172.05(C). Applicable fees may be assessed in accordance with the current fee
schedule adopted by the County Board as codified in §
178.01 and the Lake County Animal Care and Control Program Administrative
Procedures and Policies.
   (B)   Vaccination prior to release from confinement. At the expense of the
owner, a biting dog or cat four months or older not currently vaccinated
against rabies, as provided elsewhere in this chapter shall be vaccinated
against rabies prior to being released from confinement.
   (C)   Microchipping after release from confinement. At the expense of the
owner, if not already implanted, a biting dog or cat shall be microchipped
within 30 days after being released from confinement, and the owner shall
provide written verification of the procedure to the Health Officer.
   (D)   Specimen submission in lieu of confinement. When a biting animal
cannot be confined for observation for any reason, the biting animal shall be
humanely euthanized and the animal's brain shall be submitted to a recognized

§ 172.06 RABIES VACCINATION AND COMPANION ANIMAL REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Vaccination. Every owner of a dog or cat four months or more of age
shall have the dog or cat that is not medically exempt vaccinated against
rabies by a licensed veterinarian. Every dog or cat shall have a second rabies
vaccination within one year of the first. Terms of subsequent vaccine
administration and duration of immunity must be in compliance with USDA
licenses of vaccines used. If a licensed veterinarian establishes in writing
that a rabies inoculation would compromise a dog or cat's health, then the dog
or cat shall be exempt from the rabies inoculation requirement.
   (B)   Vaccination certification, registration. A licensed veterinarian who
vaccinates the dog or cat of a Lake County resident against rabies shall
provide documentation of the vaccination on a certificate form approved by the
Health Officer. The licensed veterinarian shall issue a numbered registration
tag, procured from the Health Officer, with each vaccination certificate. Only
one dog or cat shall be included on each certificate. The licensed veterinarian
shall submit records of all rabies vaccinations to the Health Officer monthly.
      (1)   Registration tag not issued at time of vaccination. If a
registration tag is not issued at the time a dog or cat is vaccinated against
rabies (e.g., if the owner refuses to obtain the tag from the veterinarian, or
if the veterinarian is located outside the County of Lake), the owner must
register the dog or cat within 30 days after the vaccination. The owner must
present an approved, properly completed vaccination certificate issued by the
veterinarian who administered the vaccination. In accordance with this chapter,
the Health Officer shall furnish the owner with a registration tag, the
duration of which shall coincide with the period of vaccination.
      (2)   Medical exemption. When a licensed veterinarian provides written
documentation that a rabies vaccination would compromise a dog or a cat's
health, the Health Officer shall determine the dog or cat to be exempt from the
rabies vaccination requirement. The owner must register the dog or cat as
medically exempt within 30 days after the determination. The Health Officer
shall furnish the owner with a medically exempt registration tag, which shall
be valid for a period of one year.
   (C)   Registration tag fees. The fee for a registration tag shall be
assessed in accordance with the current fee schedule adopted by the County
Board as codified in §
178.01. A veterinarian may charge pet owners a service fee, not to exceed $2,
for each registration tag issued. All registration tag fees collected by a
veterinarian shall be submitted to the Health Officer monthly.
   (D)   Registration requirements for new county residents. The Health Officer
shall honor a registration tag and vaccination certificate issued by another
county in Illinois for a dog or cat owner that has established residence in
Lake County during the duration of the vaccination period. New residents to
Lake County from outside Illinois who own a dog or cat, four months of age or
older, shall register the dog or cat with the Health Officer within 30 days
after establishing residence in Lake County.
   (E)   Evidence of registration. An owner of a dog or cat that is four months
of age or older shall assure that the dog or cat wears a registration tag on a
collar or harness at all times, except when the dog or cat is on the owner's
premises.

   An owner or harborer of a dog, cat, or other animal shall control the animal
when it is not on their premises. A dog, cat, or other animal found running at
large contrary to provisions of this chapter may be apprehended and impounded.
A dog or cat found running at large contrary to the provisions of this chapter
a second or subsequent time must be sterilized within 30 days after being
reclaimed, unless already sterilized, and the owner shall provide written
verification of the procedure to the Health Officer. A dog that is actively
engaged in a legal hunting activity, including training, is not considered to
be running at large when the dog is on land that is open to hunting, or on land
on which the person has obtained permission to hunt or to train a dog. A dog
that is in a dog-friendly area or dog park is not considered to be running at
large if the dog is monitored or supervised by a person.

§ 172.12 DANGEROUS, VICIOUS AND ANIMAL-AGGRESSIVE DOGS.
   (A)   Dangerous and/or vicious dog determinations and requirements. The
determination that a dog is vicious or dangerous shall be made in accordance
with the requirements of the Illinois Animal Control Act and this chapter. Any
associated enforcement shall proceed in accordance with the requirements of the
Illinois Animal Control Act, this chapter and the current fee schedule adopted
by the County Board as codified in §
178.01.
   (B)   Animal-aggressive dog determinations and requirements. The
determination that a dog is animal-aggressive, and any associated enforcement,
shall proceed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   Initiation and conduct of animal-aggressive dog investigations.
When the Health Officer has received evidence that a dog has behaved in a
manner that may meet the standards established in this chapter for an animal-
aggressive determination, the Health Officer shall initiate an investigation
into the matter. The investigation shall include: (a) sending, within three
business days of the Health Officer becoming aware of the alleged infraction,
notification to the owner of the alleged infractions, the fact that an
investigation has been initiated, and affording the owner an opportunity to
meet with the Health Officer; (b) gathering medical and/or veterinary evidence;
(c) interviewing witnesses or receiving witness statements; and (d) making a
detailed written report. After the investigation has been completed, the Health
Officer may deem a dog to be animal-aggressive, as set forth in subsection (B)
(3) below.
      (2)   Animal-aggressive dog impoundments. When an investigation into an
animal-aggressive determination has begun, if the dog that is the subject of
the investigation is not already in hospital confinement for rabies
observation, the dog shall be immediately impounded and confined by the Health
Officer during the pendency of the determination and its disposition by the
Health Officer, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Depending on the
severity and nature of the attack that caused the initiation of the animal-
aggressive dog investigation, the Health Officer may require the immediate
impoundment of the dog.
      (3)   Animal-aggressive dog determinations and notification.
         (a)   The Health Officer shall determine a dog to be animal-aggressive
when the dog is shown by clear and convincing evidence to have caused serious
physical injury or death to a companion animal, without justification. A dog
shall not be declared animal-aggressive if the Health Officer determines the
conduct of the dog was justified because the seriously injured or killed animal
was attacking or threatening to attack the dog or its offspring, the dog was
responding to pain or injury, or the dog was protecting itself, its owner,
custodian, or a member of its household, kennel, or offspring. The Health
Officer may seek, or the owner may provide information from a certified applied
animal behaviorist or other recognized animal behavior expert in making the
determination of whether the dog's behavior was justified pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
         (b)   When a dog is determined to be animal-aggressive, the owner
shall be served written notification of the determination by the Health Officer
within 24 hours. The notification shall include the determination of the
finding and the disposition requirements as established by the Health Officer.
The notification shall also include a description of the steps the owner is
required to take based on the determination, as well as the process to seek
review of the disposition or appeal the determination.
      (4)   Animal-aggressive dog dispositions. In the provision of an animal-
aggressive determination notification pursuant to subsection (B)(3) above, the
Health Officer shall, based upon the evidence of the severity of the attack
and/or previous history of other similar attack(s), determine the disposition
of the dog, which may include any one or a combination of the following
requirements:
         (a)   Enforcement of any or all of the requirements of a dangerous dog
determination pursuant to subsection (A) above, with the exception of the
public safety fine;
         (b)   Requiring that the dog be kept in an enclosure approved by the
Health Officer, and only allowed out of the enclosure to obtain veterinary
care, in case of emergency where the dog's life is threatened, or to comply
with an order of the court;
         (c)   Requiring that the dog be kept in an enclosure approved by the
Health Officer whenever the dog is on the owner's premises, but outside the
owner's residence;
         (d)   Requiring that the dog be kept in a fenced yard approved by the
Health Officer whenever the dog is on the owner's premises, but outside the
owner's residence;
         (e)   Requiring the dog to be muzzled whenever it is outside the
owner's residence in a manner that will prevent it from biting any person or
animal, but that shall not injure the dog or interfere with its vision or
respiration;
         (f)   Requiring the dog to be under control by leash or lead whenever
it is outside the owner's residence;
         (g)   Humanely euthanizing the dog;
         (h)   Payment of the annual registration fee established in accordance
with the current fee schedule adopted by the County Board as codified in §
178.01.
      (5)   Animal-aggressive dog disposition review. The owner of a dog
determined to be animal-aggressive may request a review of the disposition of
the dog by contacting the Health Officer, within three business days from the
date of the notification of the determination and disposition. The Health
Officer shall hold a review hearing within seven business days after receiving
the request to review the disposition. The Health Officer shall not sell, offer
for adoption, or dispose of the dog until a final decision is rendered and all
of the appeal processes have expired. If a hearing is requested by an owner of
an animal-aggressive dog, the Health Officer shall, after hearing the testimony
of all interested parties, render a decision within five business days
regarding the disposition of the dog, and shall notify the owner in writing
within 24 hours of the determined disposition. In no event shall this review
process extend the time to file an appeal of the determination as set forth in
subsection (B)(6) below.
      (6)   Animal-aggressive dog appeals. The owner of a dog determined to be
animal-aggressive may seek review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law.
If, however, the owner of the dog informs the Health Officer in writing that
they are waiving all rights to appeal such that no appeal will be filed, the
disposition set forth in the notice pursuant to subsections (B)(3) and (B)(4)
above may be carried out. Until such time, the Health Officer shall not sell,
offer for adoption, or dispose of the dog until a final decision is rendered
and the appeal process has expired. The owner is responsible for all
impoundment fees/costs as set forth in subsection (B)(7) below during this
timeframe.
      (7)   Animal-aggressive impoundment fees/ costs. The owner of a dog that
has been impounded as the result of the initiation of an animal-aggressive
determination investigation shall be responsible for all costs associated with
boarding and caring for the dog during the entirety of the investigation,
determination, disposition and appeal process.
      (8)   Applicability of animal- aggressive dispositions to a new owner. No
owner of a dog determined to be animal-aggressive may sell, offer for adoption,
or give away the dog without approval from the Health Officer. The Health
Officer shall grant approval for the transfer of the dog after the prospective
new owner has been issued a revised disposition that names the new owner as the
person responsible for meeting the requirements of the original disposition.
      (9)   Animal-aggressive disposition notification. If an owner of a dog
that is determined to be animal-aggressive relocates to another jurisdiction,
they shall notify the Health Officer, and shall also notify the Administrator
of Animal Control in the jurisdiction to which they are relocating.

targeting for education and enforcement those issues which are most commonly
associated with the occurrence of foodborne illness. Those issues are time-
temperature control, handwashing, and cross-contamination prevention. Time-
temperature control is the most important prevention technique for reducing the
occurrence of foodborne illness. This subchapter codifies an ordinance defining
food, time/temperature control for safety (TCS) food, food service facility,
mobile food unit, pushcart, temporary food service facility, Health Officer,
utensils, equipment, and the like; providing for the sale of only sound, safe,
and properly labeled food; regulating the sources of food; establishing
sanitation standards for food, food protection, food service operations, food
service personnel, food service equipment and utensils, sanitary facilities and
controls, and other facilities; requiring permits for the operation of food
service facilities; regulating the inspection of the facilities; providing for
the examination and condemnation of food; providing for incorporation by
reference the Illinois Food Code”, as amended from time to time, which is on
file with the Secretary of State, and the chapter entitled “Compliance and
Enforcement” of the current and subsequent edition of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration model food code, as amended from time to time and promulgated by
the U.S, Food and Drug Administration; and providing for the enforcement of
this subchapter, and the fixing of penalties.
