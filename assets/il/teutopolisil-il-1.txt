   (B)   (1)   A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all of the following acts
or privileges:
         (a)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or
receiving in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a
rate of 6% of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer; and
         (b)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or
receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a
rate of 6% of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail
from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this division (B), any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such
other state, which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state.
      (2)   The tax imposed by this section is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
   (C)   (1)   The tax authorized by this section shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this section and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this section
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.
      (2)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
   (D)   On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last
day of every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this section on
telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the Department pursuant to the state’s Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, § 5-50), being 35 ILCS
636/5-1 et seq. and any accompanying rules and regulations created by the
Department to implement the Act.
   (E)   (1)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims
to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this section on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
      (2)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a
resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant.
The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through
misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication
tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer
applies because of the person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
      (3)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall
not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale, unless the
person has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that
number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any
sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale.

convenient to the taxpayer and the local tax administrator.

due and owing.

years maximum after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.

for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
      (3)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax
return was filed by the taxpayer.
   (N)   (1)   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a
taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or
assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an
application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the
tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay
the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application, but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application.
      (2)   A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
      (3)   The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90
days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed
as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.
   (O)   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal
or standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk’s office.
   (P)   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes.
Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the
lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      (1)   Timely remove the lien at the village’s expense;
      (2)   Correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
      (3)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   (Q)   This section shall be liberally construed and administered to
supplement all of the village’s tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this section, this section
shall be controlling.

may occur and where a minimum air gap cannot be provided between the water
outlet to the fixture or equipment and its flood-level rim.
   (A)   Connections not subject to backpressure. Where a water connection is
not subject to backpressure, a vacuum breaker shall be installed on the
discharge side of the last valve on the line serving the fixture or equipment.
A list of some conditions requiring protective devices of this kind is given in
§
51.58(D).
   (B)   Connections subject to back pressure. Where a potable water connection
is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump, or other equipment with a hazard
of backflow or back-siphonage where the water connection is subject to back
pressure and an air gap cannot be installed, the Superintendent will require
adequate protection which may include the use of an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow preventer. A partial list of such connections is shown in §
51.58(E).
(Prior Code, § 51.40) (Ord. 548, passed 12-5-1984)
§ 51.41 BOOSTER PUMPS.
   When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the
possibility exists that a positive pressure of less than 20 psi may occur on
the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low pressure cutoff on
the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on
the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to other outlets.
(Prior Code, § 51.41) (Ord. 548, passed 12-5-1984)
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
§ 51.55 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
   It shall be the responsibility of building and premises owners to maintain
all backflow preventers and vacuum breakers within the building or on the
premises in good working order, and to make no piping or other arrangements for
the purpose of bypassing backflow devices.

right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.

stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then
before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication

authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (D)(1) or (D)(2)
above. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle
in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   After stopping as required by division (D)(1) or (D)(2) above, the
driver of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to
change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120
seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to
detect the arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s size or
weight, shall have the right to proceed, after yielding the right-of-way to
oncoming traffic facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign as required by §
70.41.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall

maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of

and to hear testimony and take evidence for use in the performance of the
Commissioner’s duties, and for the information of the Commissioner to issue
subpoenas which shall be effective in any part of the state. Other persons may
be designated by the Commissioner to take action for the purpose of obtaining
any of the information desired by the Commissioner under this section;

powers and duties enumerated herein, except as the Commissioner may
specifically exclude by such appointment; and
      (6)   To report to the Village Board from time to time actions which have
been taken to grant or deny liquor licenses or to penalize licensees.
   (C)   (1)   The Local Liquor Control Commissioner may revoke or suspend any
license issued by him or her if he or she determines that the licensee has

applicable rule or regulations established by the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner or the State Commission which is not inconsistent with law.

fine shall be imposed, except after a public hearing by the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner with at least three days’ prior written notice to the
licensee, as provided in the state’s Liquor Control Act, as now or hereafter
amended, affording the licensee an opportunity to appear and defend. If the
licensee fails to appear for such public hearing after receiving notice as
provided in the state’s Liquor Control Act, a default judgment may be entered
and the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may revoke or suspend the license
and/or impose a fine.
   (D)   If the Commissioner has reason to believe that any continued operation
of a particular licensed premises will immediately threaten the welfare of the

the reason for such conclusion, and without notice or hearing, order the
licensed premises closed for not more than seven days, giving the licensee an
opportunity to be heard during that period. Provided, if such licensee shall
also be engaged in the conduct of another business on the licensed premises,
such order shall not be applicable to such other business.
   (E)   (1)   In determining the appropriate penalty for violating any of the
provisions of this chapter or any state law pertaining to the sale of alcohol,

as the Local Liquor Control Commissioner deems are relevant, including, but not
limited to, the nature and circumstances surrounding the violation, the past
record of the licensee, and the penalties previously imposed by the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner for similar violation.
      (2)   The past record shall include the record of the current licensee as
well as the record of any other existing or prior licensee where there is or
was substantial common identity between the owners of the current licensee and
the owners of such other licensee. Where the licensee under consideration, or
such other prior or existing licensee, is a business entity such as a
corporation or partnership, the ownership interest includes the equity holdings
of the stockholder or partner. The consideration of the past record of such
other or prior licensee shall only include that time period when such common
identity is found.
   (F)   The Local Liquor Control Commissioner shall, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within five days after such hearing, if the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner determines after such hearing that the license
should be revoked or suspended and/or a fine should be imposed, state the
reasons for such determination in a written order of revocation or suspension
and/or a fine should be imposed and shall serve a copy of such order upon the
licensee.

applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to
approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a
completed application.
            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of
the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village’s denial of the
permit request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (c)   1.   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or
deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed
application.
            2.   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted
activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than
105 days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the one
hundred twentieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth
day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt
of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village’s denial of the
permit request within the time limits as provided under this chapter.
         (d)   The village shall deny an application which does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
            1.   If the village determines that applicable codes, ordinances,
or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and
conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
The village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code
provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the
documentation to the applicant on or before the day the village denies an
application.
            2.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure
to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the village’s review period.
            3.   The applicant must notify the village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the revised application.
            4.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
         (e)   Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant
shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement, provided by the village
for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the application. For
subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a
municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a
license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement.
      (4)   Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village shall
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to
provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents,
information and fees specifically enumerated in the village’s permit
application form are submitted by the applicant to the village. Processing
deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      (5)   The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
village; or
         (b)   A local, state, or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (6)   (a)   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities
within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant’s
discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the village may remove a small wireless facility collocations from the
application and treat separately a small wireless facility collocations for
which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for
consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate
permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (7)   (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less
than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations
unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the
new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or
any provision, condition, or requirement contained in this chapter.
         (b)   If the Act is repealed as provided in § 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      (8)   Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information, and
notices to the village by personal delivery at the village’s designated place
of business, by regular mail postmarked on the date due, or by any other
commonly used means, including electronic mail.
   (C)   Collocation requirements and conditions.
      (1)   Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village’s
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (2)   Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair, and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition
and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents, or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No interference with public safety communication frequencies.
         (a)   The wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless
facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety
agency for public safety communications.
         (b)   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment.
         (c)   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         (d)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC,
including 47 CFR §§ 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR §§ 90.672 through
47 CFR 90.675.
         (e)   The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in division (C)(3)(d) above. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   Collocation.
         (a)   The wireless provider shall not collocate a small wireless
facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
         (b)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         (c)   For purposes of this division (C)(4), the terms COMMUNICATIONS
SPACE, COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   Applicable codes. The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      (6)   Designs. The wireless provider shall comply with written design
standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive
plan, or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate placements.
         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to a collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose
that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if he or she has the right to use
the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this division (C)(7).
      (8)   Height limitations.
         (a)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
         (b)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures
on which the small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher
of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet aboveground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms, and
conditions set forth in the Town Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 154, §
154.170, et seq.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and
a private property owner that concern design or construction standards
applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses
the wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply
with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding
requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of
existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the
requirements include a waiver, zoning, or other process that addresses requests
to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do
not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an
application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350 for each small wireless
facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one
small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support

      (2)   The applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000 for each small
wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of
a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The village shall not require an application, approval, or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with division (B)(1)(d) above; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation, or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately-owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding

Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of § 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
         (b)   For the purposes of this division (E)(3), PUBLIC UTILITY has the
meaning given to that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement:
            1.   To obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer
cable service or video service; or
            2.   To obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain,

   (F)   Pre-existing agreements.
      (1)   Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers that
relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way,
including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility
poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small
wireless facilities collocated on the village’s utility poles pursuant to
applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to
applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
      (2)   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village
on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees, and terms that the
village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small
wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying
the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees, and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
village’s utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village
before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option
under this division (F).
   (G)   Annual recurring rate.
      (1)   A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring
rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located
in a right-of-way that equals
         (a)   Two hundred dollars per year; or
         (b)   The actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless
provider’s use of space on the village utility pole.
      (2)   If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and
direct costs, the fee shall be $200 payable on the first day after the first
annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.

      (1)   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility
shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of
written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the
abandonment.
      (2)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      (3)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if
it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.
(Ord. 903, passed 6-20-2018)
§ 113.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court for the Fourth Judicial District of the county shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act, 50 ILCS 840. Pending resolution of a dispute
concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal
utility poles within the right-of-way, the village shall allow the collocating
person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than $200 per year
per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution
of the dispute.
(Ord. 903, passed 6-20-2018)
§ 113.05 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord. 903, passed 6-20-2018)
§ 113.06 INSURANCE.
   (A)   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
   (B)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
   (C)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this
section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the village.

   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct,

(720 ILCS 5/4-5) (Prior Code, § 130.03)
§ 130.04 RECKLESSNESS.
   A person is reckless or acts recklessly when that person consciously

   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight
by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person
an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by
requesting the person to identify himself or herself and to explain his or her
presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this
section if the police officer did not comply with the preceding sentence, or if
it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, if
it had been believed by the police officer at the time, would have dispelled
the alarm. Any police officer may arrest any person suspected of being a
loiterer or prowler without a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay
in arresting the suspect caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the
suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after first being warned by a
police officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted, to
loiter, stand, sit, or lie in or upon any public or quasi- public sidewalk,
street, curb, crosswalk, walkway area, mall, or that portion of private
property utilized for public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the
free passage of pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any
person to block, obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any
building open to the public.
   (C)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including

this section, the court may order a parent, legal guardian, or other person
convicted of a violation of §
132.02(B) to perform community service as determined by the court, except that
the legal guardian of a person who has been made a ward of the court under 705
ILCS 405/1-1 et seq. may not be ordered to perform community service. The dates
and times established for the performance of community service by the parent,
legal guardian, or other person convicted of a violation of §
132.02(B) shall not conflict with the dates and times that the person is
employed in his or her regular occupation.

or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.

      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or

exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, the evidence is

conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement, or
possession of a mold, engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity
specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more
than three copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an
intent to disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age; or
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

   (F)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control, repairs to
public facilities, and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations;
   (G)   To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the
potential for creating blight areas;
   (H)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. parts 59-79, as amended;
   (I)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available by fulfilling
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; and

substantially improved within the floodplain or the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation when defined, shall have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated or structurally dry floodproofed to the 0.2% annual chance flood
elevation or three feet above the BFE, whichever is greater. Adequate parking
shall be provided for staffing of the critical facilities at or above the BFE
or 0.2% chance flood, when defined. Access routes to all critical facilities
should be reviewed and considered when permitting. Access routes should be
elevated to or above the level of the BFE .
         (b)   Floodproofing and sealing measures may also be used to provide
protection, as described in §
151.07, and must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced
by or released into floodwaters.
         (c)   Critical facilities include emergency services facilities (such
as fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes, and senior
care facilities, sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, specific
roads, and bridges required for evacuation, and critical utility sites
(telephone switching stations or electrical transformers).
   (B)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
   (C)   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential
in the event of failure. Permits for dams may be required from IDNR/OWR.
Contact IDNR/OWR to determine if a permit is required. If a permit is required,
a permit application must be made to IDNR/OWR prior to the construction or
major modification of jurisdictional dams.
   (D)   (1)   The Building Official shall require a CLOMR prior to issuance of
a development permit for:
         (a)   Proposed floodway encroachments that will cause an increase in
the BFE; and
         (b)   Proposed development which will increase the BFE by more than
0.1 feet in riverine area where FEMA has provided a BFE but no floodway.
      (2)   Once a CLOMR has been issued, the development permit may be issued
for site grading and structures necessary in the area of the map change to
achieve the final LOMR. Upon completion, the applicant shall submit as-built
certifications, as required by FEMA, to achieve a final LOMR prior to the
release of final development permits. Review division (E) below for the
construction of buildings in any floodplain issued a LOMR based on fill.
   (E)   When construction of a building following a LOMR based on fill is
requested, the condition where a site in the floodplain is removed due to the
use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, the applicant may not apply for
a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a building below the
BFE in the floodplain.

§ 151.11 VARIANCES.
   (A)   No variances shall be granted within a floodway if any increases in
the base flood elevation would result.
   (B)   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Board of Appeals
for a variance. The Board of Appeals shall review the applicant’s request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Board of Trustees. The
Board of Trustees may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it
deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this chapter. The
Board of Trustees shall base the determination on:
      (1)   Technical justifications submitted by the applicant;
      (2)   The staff report, comments, and recommendations submitted by the
Building Official; and
      (3)   The limitations, considerations, and conditions set forth in this
section.
   (C)   The findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the Board of
Appeals according to division (A) above, the notifications required by division
(B) above, and a record of hearings and evidence considered as justification
for the issuance of all variances from this chapter shall be maintained by the
village in perpetuity.
   (D)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates and the
Board of Appeals finds that all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable;
      (3)   The variance granted is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, public safety,
destruction of beneficial stream uses, and functions including, aquatic
habitat, causation of fraud on or victimization of the public, conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances, or creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, lost environmental stream uses and
functions, repairs to streambeds and banks, or repairs to roads, utilities, or
other public facilities;
      (6)   The circumstances of the property are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP;
      (7)   Good and sufficient cause has been shown that the unique
characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site renders
the requirements of this chapter inappropriate; and
      (8)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (E)   The Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of §
151.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; or
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (F)   In reviewing applications for variances, all technical evaluations,
all relevant factors, all other portions of these regulations, and the
following shall be considered:
      (1)   The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands
resulting in further injury or damage;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents,
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed development
to the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternate locations for the proposed
development that are not subject to flooding or erosion;
      (6)   The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and
anticipated development;
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed development to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program for that area;
      (8)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (9)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and debris
and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; or
      (10)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, streets, and
bridges.
   (G)   Variances issued for the reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a
historic site or historic structure as defined in “historic structures”, may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of §§
151.06 and
151.07 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; and
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a historic structure.
   (H)   Variances issued for the construction or substantial improvement of
agricultural structures which do not meet the non-residential building
requirements of §
151.07(B) and (C); provided the requirements of divisions (A) through (G) above
and the following are satisfied:
      (1)   A determination that the proposed agricultural structure:
         (a)   Is used exclusively in connection with the production,
harvesting, storage, raising, or drying of agricultural commodities, or storage
of tools or equipment used in connection with these purposes or uses, and will
be restricted to such exclusive uses;
         (b)   Has low damage potential (amount of physical damage, contents
damage, and loss of function);
         (c)   Does not increase risks and pose a danger to public health,
safety, and welfare if flooded and contents are released, including, but not
limited to, the effects of flooding on liquified natural gas terminals, and
production and storage of highly volatile, toxic, or water-reactive materials;
and
         (d)   Complies with the wet floodproofing construction requirements of
division (H)(2)below.
      (2)   Wet floodproofed structures shall:
         (a)   The exterior and interior building components and elements
(i.e., foundation, wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, and
the like) below the BFE, must be built with flood-resistant materials in
accordance with §
151.07;
         (b)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (c)   All enclosed areas below the FPE shall provide for equalization
of hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters. A minimum of one permanent opening shall be provided on at least
two walls that is below the BFE and no more than one foot above finished grade.
The openings shall provide a total net area of not less than one square inch
for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the BFE,
or the design must be certified by a registered P.E. as providing the
equivalent performance in accordance with accepted standards of practice. Refer
to FEMA TB 1, openings in foundation walls and walls of enclosures, for
additional guidance;

         (e)   If located in a floodway, must be issued a state floodway
permit, and comply with §
151.06; and
         (f)   The building may not be used for manure storage or livestock
confinement operations.
(Ord. 1066, passed 11-6-2024)
§ 151.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from proper
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
(Ord. 1066, passed 11-6-2024)
§ 151.99 PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Village Attorney may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Village Attorney shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days from the date the written notice is
issued, to correct the violation:
      (1)   The village shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   (1)   The Village Attorney shall inform the owner that any such
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The Village Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Board of Appeals. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state the grounds for the
complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation, and the time and place of the
hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board
of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

costs of the public hearing incurred by the village shall be charged to the
owner or upon a determination of a violation and the issuance of an order
setting forth a suspension, or revocation. A copy of the written order shall be
served on the owner within the five calendar days after the hearing. Service of
the written order on the agent or employee of the owner shall constitute
service on the owner. If the owner’s whereabouts are unknown or reasonable
attempts to serve the owner have failed, service shall be by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation within the village.

NON-CONFORMITIES
§ 154.125 DESCRIPTION.
   Within the districts established by this chapter, or by amendments that may
later be adopted, there may exist lots, premises, structures, and uses which
were lawful before this chapter or any amendment thereto was effective, but
which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of
this chapter or future amendment. These are commonly known as non-conforming
uses, structures, and the like, and are herein referred to under the general
term “non-conformities.”
(Prior Code, § 154.120) (Ord. 770, passed 2-20-2008)
§ 154.126 INTENT.
   Under the law, non-conformities are permitted to be continued, subject to
certain conditions and restrictions. It is the intent of this chapter to permit
these non-conformities to continue until they are removed (except as otherwise
herein provided), but not to encourage their survival. Such non-conformities
are declared by this subchapter to be incompatible with the permitted
structures and uses of land and structures in the districts involved. It is
further the intent of this chapter that such non-conformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded, or extended except as provided for herein, nor to be
used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district.
(Prior Code, § 154.121) (Ord. 770, passed 2-20-2008)
§ 154.127 RULES.
   (A)   A non-conforming use of land, premises, or structures shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded, or extended after the effective date hereof by the
attachment of a structure, premises or land, of additional signs intended to be
seen off the premises or land, or by the addition of other uses of a nature
which would be prohibited in the district involved.
   (B)   A non-conforming use or a non-conforming structure which is non-
conforming only because of failure to provide required off-street parking
spaces, loading berths, or setbacks shall have all the rights of a conforming
use or structure.
(Prior Code, § 154.122) (Ord. 770, passed 2-20-2008)
§ 154.128 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any
lot which is a lot of record on the effective date thereof. This provision
shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or
width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that
yard dimensions and other requirements not involved area or width, or both, of
the lots shall conform to the regulations hereinafter provided.
   (B)   (1)   Yard regulations and standards for single non-conforming lots of
record are as follows:
         (a)   Front yard. The front yard regulations and standards of the
district in which such lot is located shall apply.
         (b)   Rear yard. The rear yard regulations and standards of the
district in which such lot is located shall apply.
         (c)   Side yard. On such lot with a width of 50 feet or more, two side
yards shall be provided as required by the regulations and standards of the
district in which such lot is located.
      (2)   On such lot less than 50 feet but not less than 27 feet in width,
two side yards shall be provided, each equaling 10% of the lot width.
      (3)   On such lot less than 27 feet but not less than 20 feet in width,
the structure located on such lot shall have a width of not more than 90% of
such lot width. Only one side yard need be provided, equaling in width the
difference between the lot width and the maximum permitted width of the
structure. No other side yard need be provided.
      (4)   The wall of any building facing the side of the lot on which no
side yard is required shall be without openings and shall not be constructed as
a common wall.

§ 154.129 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, on the effective date hereof or amendment of this chapter, a lawful
use of land exists that is no longer permissible under the regulations and
standards of this chapter as adopted or amended, such use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions.
   (A)   No such non-conforming use of land shall be enlarged, increased, or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this chapter.

period of more than 180 consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations and standards set by this chapter for the district
in which such land is located.

characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following
provisions.
   (A)   No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases
its non-conformity.
   (B)   Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more
than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be
reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations and standards for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.

lease, bequest, devise, inheritance, or legacy of the property.
   (B)   Should such trailer coach be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its replacement cost at the time of its destruction, it shall
not be replaced except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

lawful use of a structure or of a premises exists that is no longer permissible
under the regulations and standards of this chapter as adopted or amended, such
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions.
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or altered except in changing the use of
such structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
   (B)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of the
building or structure which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use
shall be extended to occupy land outside of such structure.
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure or of any premises may be changed to another non-conforming use,
provided that the Board of Appeals, either by general rule or by making
findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally
appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing non-
conforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Appeals may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (D)   Any structure, or any premises, in or on which a non-conforming use is
superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations and
standards of the district in which such structure or premises is located, and
the non-conforming use shall not be resumed.
   (E)   When a non-conforming use of a building or structure, or of a
premises, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months or for 18
months during any three-year period, the structure or the premises shall not
thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations and standards of
the district in which it is located.

§ 154.146 PURPOSE.
   It is hereby declared the policy and purpose of this chapter to employ the
special use as a flexible means of permitting certain exceptions to the
districts established, and the rules and regulations adopted herein, in cases
where the public benefit of such uses outweighs the potential harm, and under
such conditions imposed as are necessary to protect the public health, safety,

   (C)   It conforms to the applicable regulations and standards of, and
preserves the essential character of, the district in which it shall be
located; and
   (D)   In the case of an existing non-conforming use, will make such use more

appears:
      (1)   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are not applicable
to other lands or structures in the same district;
      (2)   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other lands or structures
in the same district under the terms of this chapter;
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant; and/or
      (4)   The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands
or structures in the same district.
   (B)   No non-conforming use of neighboring lands or structures in the same
district, and no permitted use of lands or structures in other districts, shall
be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
(Prior Code, § 154.167) (Ord. 770, passed 2-20-2008)
§ 154.173 LIMITATION IN GRANTING VARIANCES.
   When it appears that the conditions set forth in §

dwelling unit or a lodging unit;
   (G)   To permit a reduction in the minimum or an increase in the maximum
floor area of a building as imposed by the applicable regulations;

   (I)   To permit the reconstruction of a non-conforming structure which has
been destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than 50% of its value by fire,
an act of God or the public enemy, where the Board of Appeals shall find some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the non-conforming structure;
and
   (J)   To permit in a residential district the creating of new lots having
areas less than the minimum specified for the district, where such new lots
conform with the size of lots directly across the street from and immediately
adjacent on either side to the tract being subdivided; provided, that the tract
is located in an area which has been partially subdivided prior to the
enactment of this chapter, it being the purpose of this variance to allow the
logical completion of a subdivision plan already in progress, and not to permit
the extension of small lot sizes to surrounding lands.

height of walls, fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping of the site
shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof;
      (8)   The nature, location, size, and site layout of the uses shall be
such that it will be a harmonious part of the district in which it is situated
taking into account, among other things, prevailing shopping habits,
convenience of access by prospective patrons, and the physical and economic
relationship of one type of use to another; and
      (9)   The location, size, intensity, and site layout of the use shall be
such that its operations will not be objectionable to nearby dwellings by
reason of noise, fumes, or flash of lights to a greater degree than is normal,
with respect to the proximity of commercial to residential uses, nor interfere
with an adequate supply of light and air, nor increase the danger of fire or
otherwise endanger the public safety.
   (E)   Miscellaneous. No order of the Board of Appeals permitting the
erection or alteration of buildings shall be valid for a period longer than one
year unless a building permit for such erection or alteration is obtained
within such period and such erection or alteration is commenced and proceeds to
completion in accordance with the terms of such permit. No order of the Board
of Appeals permitting a use of a building or premises shall be valid for a
period longer than one year unless such use is established within such period;

or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in full force and effect
if a building permit for such use, erection, or alteration is obtained within
such period and such erections or alterations are commenced and proceed to
completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.

   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain

   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction has begun within that period
and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. Notwithstanding the

issuance.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time, and place designated by the village,
with such village representatives in attendance as the Village Foreman deems
necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the
permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work
will occur, including, but not limited to, presence or absence of other utility
facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of
other utilities, use of public way by the public during construction and
ingress and egress by adjacent property owners, and methods of construction.

requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules,
and regulations.

§ 155.28 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.

submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village, within 90 calendar
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where and how the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall
be treated as a request for variance in accordance with §
155.66. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the public way or modify the facility so
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. If the
permittee fails to remove or modify the facility promptly, as required by the
village, then the village may remove said facility at the permittee’s expense.

permittee’s failure to comply with any ordinances, rules, regulations, orders,
permits, and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter;
and
      (3)   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-
performance by the permittee in violation of this chapter, including, but not
limited to, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform which the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional irrevocable letter of credit in
a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division (B) shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide it will not be canceled without prior written notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the village and within the state
at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the public way to at least
as good a condition as existing prior to the construction under the permit, as
determined by the Village Foreman, in his or her sole discretion, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs the village estimates are likely to
be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations within the village with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Foreman
may, in the exercise of his or her sole discretion, allow the permittee to post
a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each individual phase
of the construction allowed under the permit. The amount of the security fund
for individual phases of construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
which would have been required under the provisions of this division (C) for
any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village upon 14 calendar days’ advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this division (D), may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within
the 14 calendar day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities which are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs, or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter which the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount sufficient
from the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 calendar days after receipt of written notice
from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request any and all interest accrued on
the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
losses, or damages incurred by the village as a result the revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss, or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding, or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall
affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.57 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of facilities, all facilities, regardless of type, shall be
subject to the general location requirements of this section.
      (1)   No interference with facilities owned by the village. No facilities
shall be placed in any location that the Village Foreman determines will
require the relocation or displacement of any of the village’s facilities or
will otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the
village’s facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only minimal interference with the use of the public way and shall cause only
minimal impact upon, and interference with, the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners who adjoin said public way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No facility shall be placed in any
location that in anyway interferes with the usual travel on such public way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No facility shall be placed in any
location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the public way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the

may be located within the public way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the public way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4m) from and parallel to the public
way line;
         (b)   A new facility may, in the sole discretion of the village, be
located under the paved portion of a highway only if other locations are
impracticable or inconsistent (for example, a new cable may be installed in a
existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near to the public way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5m) from the public way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3m) of the public way line or
as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of the highways of
the village may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as
encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the
roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, storm sewers,
sanitary sewers, water lines, or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as possible.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC’s
rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines” (83
Ill. Adm. Code § 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3m) of the public way line
of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.

needs is provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility provider to provide a
marker at each public way line where an underground facility other than a power
or communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the
type of facility, the utility provider’s name, and an emergency phone number.
Markers may also be eliminated as provided in current federal regulations found
at 49 C.F.R. § 192.707 (1989).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within a particular public way. The village
may require in its sole discretion, utility providers to locate facilities
within particular public ways that are not highways, rather than within
particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a public way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
public way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed aboveground. Aboveground facilities may only be
installed if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible, as
determined by the Village Foreman, in his or her sole discretion; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility provider has demonstrated all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports,
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility provider shall include in its request to accommodate a
facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data
demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure, or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility provider and
their comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;

         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve the aesthetic and visual qualities of
the area.
      (2)   A facility may only be constructed if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the public way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.58 RELOCATION OF PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   In the event a utility provider must relocate utilities owned by the
village, the utility provider’s plans must be approved by the Village Foreman.
The proposed relocation shall meet the standards of the village for water,
sewers, and street, as set forth in Title V of this code.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.59 CONSTRUCTION METHODS, MATERIALS.
   (A)   General standards and safety requirements. The construction,
operation, and maintenance of facilities located in the public way shall be
performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner and shall further be performed
in such a manner to maintain customer service. All such work shall be performed
in substantial accordance with generally applicable federal, state, and local
regulations, as well as the National Electric Safety Code. Furthermore, all
vehicles, machinery, and/or equipment utilized during Construction and
maintenance work shall be moved and/or stored out of the public way when not in
use.
   (B)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   No borings or trenches will be allowed in the public way within ten
feet of culverts, storm sewers, drainage structures, water mains, sanitary
sewer mains, sanitary force mains, or any other underground utility unless
prior approval has been obtained from the Village Foreman.
      (2)   Compressed air missile or mole boring methods shall not be allowed
unless prior approval has been obtained from the Village Foreman. Consent must
be obtained from the Village Foreman prior to each bore utilizing either
compressed air missile or mole boring methods.
      (3)   Jacking, jetting, tunneling, and pipe bursting/ramming for a pipe,
conduit, wire, or cable greater than two inches in diameter for a roadway
crossing shall not be allowed.
      (4)   The Village Foreman shall, in his or her sole discretion, approve
any roadway crossing by bore or open trench of a pipe, conduit, wire, or cable
six inches in diameter or larger or multiple pipes, conduits, wires, or cables.
A separate plan sheet showing the plan and profile of a roadway crossing shall
be included in the plans. The plan view shall show dimensions from the proposed
crossing to such visible features as to reasonably locate the location of the
proposed crossing. The profile view shall show the existing surface at the
proposed with elevations at, but not limited to, ditch flowlines, each edge of
the right-of-way and/or easement, each edge of pavement, each center of lane
(s), each edge of lane(s), centerline of pavement, and depths of existing
utilities. The benchmark from which the elevations were derived shall be
included on sheets in the plans.
      (5)   A pipe, conduit, wire, or cable six inches in diameter or larger
installed by boring shall be in a casing pipe.
      (6)   Multiple pipes, conduits, wires, or cables may be laid in the same
open trench unless other regulations, rules, or requirements prohibit placement
in the same trench. Multiple pipes, conduits, wires, or cables placed by boring
will require casing pipe. If more than one bore is required, the minimum width
between the bores shall be the width of the largest pipe but no less than three
feet.
      (7)   A record of any bore six inches in diameter or larger shall be
submitted to the Village Foreman within one business day after completion of
the bore. Elevations shall be taken at each edge of pavement, each center of
lane(s), each edge of lane(s), and the centerline of pavement and recorded on
the plan and profile sheet in the plans.
      (8)   Any damage to the roadway by boring, including, but not limited to,
raising or cracking the pavement shall be repaired or replaced.
      (9)   Jack and auger boring may be utilized for installation, repair, or
maintenance of a facility on the public way if authorized and/or required by
the Village Foreman, in his or her sole discretion, but is typically utilized
for larger borings under roadways, railroads, streams, and similar areas where
open cut/trenches are not practical or allowed. If jack and auger boring is
authorized and/or required, the jack and auger boring shall be completed in
compliance with the following requirements:
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Pits shall be a minimum of ten feet from the
back of curb, edge of gutter, edge of pavement shoulder, or edge of pavement.
Pits shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of the operations and
shall be backfilled within 48 hours after operations are completed. While pits
are open, they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades and
temporary fencing. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and
maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads that
may be imposed upon it until backfill operations are completed.
         (b)   Drilling fluid/mud. Water or a mixture of water and bentonite
and/or polymer may be pumped to the rotating cutting head to ease cutting of
soil material and auger to the back of the casing pipe.
         (c)   Rotating cutting head. The rotating cutting edge shall not be
extended so as to be completely past the leading edge of the pipe casing.
      (10)   Horizontal directional boring or drilling may be utilized for
installation, repair, or maintenance of a facility on the public way if
authorized and/or required by the Village Foreman, in his or her sole
discretion. If horizontal directional boring or drilling is authorized and/or
required, the horizontal directional boring or drilling shall be completed in
compliance with the following requirements:
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Pits shall be a minimum of ten feet from the
back of curb, edge of gutter, edge of pavement shoulder, or edge of pavement.
Pits shall be excavated no more than 48 hours in advance of the operations and
shall be backfilled within 48 hours after operations are completed. While pits
are open, they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades and
temporary fencing. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced, and
maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads that
may be imposed upon it until backfill operations are completed.
         (b)   Surface launch bore. A horizontal directional boring or drilling
may be launched from the existing ground surface if sufficient easement and/or
right-of-way is available. A surface launch bore shall be such that the
required depth is achieved at the right-of-way or easement line.
         (c)   Drilling fluid/mud. Water or a mixture of water and bentonite
and/or polymer may be pumped to the back reamer to ease cutting of soil
material, consolidating the materials, and lubrication of the pipe or casing
following the backreamer. Drilling fluid/mud that has escaped the bore, bore
pit, or is otherwise not contained shall be cleaned up. Under no circumstances
is the fluid/mud to be washed into a drain, storm sewer, ditch, creek, stream,
river, or other bodies of water.
         (d)   Backreamer. The cutting diameter of the backreamer shall not
exceed the greatest outside diameter of the casing pipe by more than two
inches.
         (e)   Casing pipe. Under no circumstances shall a backreamer with a
diameter of six inches or more be pulled back without the casing pipe.
      (11)   Trenching for facility installation, repair, or maintenance on the
public way shall be done in accordance with the applicable portions of § 603 of
IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.”
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum, consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Village Foreman.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where public way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility provider shall not trench within
the drip line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      (12)   (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the
installation of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and
length using methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.” When excavated material is
hauled away or is unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be
used. If the utility provider utilizes an open trench, the trench shall be
backfilled and compacted with CA6 gradation and the surface of public ways
shall be replaced with the same depth and material as previously existed.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility provider shall be responsible to remove and
restore any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the
facility. If so ordered by the Village Foreman, the utility provider, at its
expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the
installed facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and
restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as
determined by the Village Foreman.
      (13)   Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair shall be
permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed to
traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division (B)(13) is
permitted under §
155.66 the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
by mechanical means as soon as practicable with granular material of CA6 or
CA10 gradation, as designated by the Village Foreman.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all public ways which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last five
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless pavement cut is necessary for a J.U.L.I.E.
locate.
      (14)   (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing pipe shall be continuous
either by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved
by the village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3m) of the public way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be located
in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of the
highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or jointed pipe approved
by the village is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and its continuous or mechanical joints
are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the public way.
      (15)   Cover shall be provided and maintained at least in the amount
specified in the following table for minimum cover for the type of facility:
 
Type of Facility                       Minimum Cover
Electric lines                         30 inches
Communication, cable, or video service 24 inches
lines

Sanitary sewer, storm sewer, or        Sufficient to provide freeze protection
drainage line                          per IEPA requirements
Water line                             Sufficient to provide freeze protection
                                       per IEPA requirements
 
   (C)   Standards and requirements for particular types of facilities.
      (1)   Electric power or communication lines.
         (a)   Code compliance. Electric power or communications facilities
along any public way in the village shall be constructed, operated, and
maintained in conformity with the provisions of 83 Ill. Adm. Code § 305
(formerly General Order 160 of the Illinois Commerce Commission) entitled
“Rules for Construction of Electric Power and Communications Lines” and the
National Electrical Safety Code.
         (b)   Overhead facilities. Overhead power or communication facilities
shall use single pole construction and, where practicable, joint use of poles
shall be used. Utility providers shall make every reasonable effort to design
the installation so guys and braces will not be needed. Variances may be
allowed if there is no feasible alternative and if guy wires are equipped with
guy guards for maximum visibility.
         (c)   Underground facilities.
            1.   Cable may be installed by trenching or plowing, provided that
special consideration is given to boring in order to minimize damage when
crossing improved entrances and side roads;
            2.   If a crossing is installed by boring or jacking, encasement
shall be provided between jacking or bore pits. Encasement may be eliminated
only if:
               a.   The crossing is installed by the use of “moles,” “whip
augers,” or other approved method which compresses the earth to make the
opening for cable installation; or
               b.   The installation is by the open trench method which is only

regulatory agencies for the appropriate industry.
      (2)   Material storage on public way. No material shall be stored on the
public way without the prior written approval of the Village Foreman. When such
storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross arms, or other
materials shall be distributed along the public way prior to and during

the village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be involved in the
construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing facilities.
   (E)   Operational restrictions.
      (1)   Construction operations on the public way may, at the discretion of
the village be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the public way or other
property.
      (2)   These restrictions may be waived by the Village Foreman if
emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.

§ 155.60 VEGETATION CONTROL; REPAIR.
   (A)   Electric utilities, compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility provider shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation
control activities in the public way in accordance with applicable state laws
and regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utility provider’s, tree trimming, or removal permit required.
Tree trimming that is done by any other utility provider with facilities in
public ways and is not performed pursuant to applicable state laws and
regulations specifically governing the same, shall not be considered a normal
maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the issuance
of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming or removal permit. Applications for
tree trimming or removal permits shall include assurance that the work will be
accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in
accepted tree pruning or removal practices. Tree trimming or removal permits
shall designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work
will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
      (3)   Removal of tree stumps. The utility provider shall remove all tree
stumps resulting from tree trimming or removing at the expense of the utility
provider. Such removal shall include removal of the tree stump, by excavating
and/or grinding the tree stump, not less than 18 inches below the surface of
the ground. All tree stumps shall be removed no later than 30 calendar days
following the tree trimming or removal.
      (4)   Tree trimming. All tree trimming and/or tree pruning shall meet the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) pruning standards and pruning
methods, as endorsed by the International Society of Arborist (ISA). All crew
foremen shall be certified line clearance tree trimmers, and all general
foremen shall be arborists certified by the ISA. Evidence that the crew foreman
and/or general foreman are properly certified shall be provided to the village
prior to commencement of any tree trimming and/or tree pruning activities.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
aim extensions, covered wire, or other means.
   (D)   Chemical use.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(1), no utility provider shall
spray, inject, or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs, or
vegetation in the village for any purpose, including the control of growth,
insects, or disease.
      (2)   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on public way unless the utility provider demonstrates to the
satisfaction and sole discretion of the Village Foreman such spraying is the
only practicable method of vegetation control. If the Village Foreman
authorizes such spraying, the utility provider must provide a copy of its
applicable Department of Agriculture applicator license.
   (E)   Repair of landscaping. If any utility provider disturbs any
landscaping or surface area in constructing any facility on public way, said
utility provider shall be obligated, at the utility provider’s expense, to
repair any and all landscaping and lime, seed, and mulch any damaged surface
area within the public way in accordance with Class 1 or 1A temporary and final
landscaping requirements contained within the IDOT Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction, unless otherwise approved by the Village Foreman.
All landscaping and/or seeding shall be completed no later than 30 calendar
days following completion of the work on the public way. All materials utilized
to repair landscaping and/or surface area shall be as designated by the Village
Foreman, at his or her sole discretion.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.61 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, MODIFICATION.
   (A)   Notice. Within 60 calendar days following written notice from the
village a utility provider shall, at its own expense, protect, support,
temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change, or alter the
position of any utility facilities within public ways whenever the village has
determined such removal, relocation, change, or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the public way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 calendar days following
written notice from the village any utility provider that owns, controls, or
maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public
way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal by the village in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the public
ways of the village as deemed necessary, appropriate or useful in response to
any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the village
shall attempt to notify the utility provider, if known, prior to cutting or
removing a facility and shall notify the utility provider, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of or useful life of a
facility within the public ways of the village the utility provider shall
provide written notice to the village within 90 calendar days. Following
receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility provider to remove
all or any portion of the facility if the Village Foreman determines, in his or
her sole discretion, such removal will be in the best interest of the public
health, safety, and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the
utility provider which abandoned the facility to remove it by giving notice of
abandonment to the village the abandoning utility provider shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility provider or person.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.62 NO DELAY.
   A utility provider shall conduct all construction, relocation, and repairs
to facilities in a timely fashion so as not to delay any projects undertaken by
the village. All work shall be commenced and completed promptly as defined in §
155.59.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.63 CLEAN UP, RESTORATION OF PUBLIC WAYS.
   The utility provider shall remove all excess material and restore all turf
and terrain and other property within ten calendar days after any portion of
the public ways are disturbed, damaged, or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility provider. This shall be done to the satisfaction of
the village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration
of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the
Village Foreman. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, rough grading, final regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other
requirement to restore the public way to a condition substantially equivalent
to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. Under no
circumstances shall a utility provider dispose of any material into a storm or
sanitary sewer line within the village without the prior approval of the
Village Foreman. The time period provided in this section may be extended, in
his or her sole discretion, by the Village Foreman for good cause shown.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.64 MAINTENANCE; EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   General. Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within public ways are to be maintained by or for the utility provider in a
manner satisfactory to the village at the utility provider’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   (a)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of
public ways, the utility provider shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the public
way, including the use of signs, lights, barricades, or flaggers. If a hazard
does not exist on the traveled portion of the public way, but the nature of the
emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment
required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided.
         (b)   Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be
permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility provider shall, as soon as possible,
notify the Village Foreman, or his or her duly authorized agents, of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the Village Police Department, the County Sheriff’s
Department, and the Village Fire Protection District shall be notified
immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility provider shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience
to the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility provider must file in writing with the
village a description of the repairs undertaken in the public way within 48
hours after an emergency repair.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.65 DAMAGE TO WATER LINES, SEWER LINES, LATERAL PIPES.
   In the event a utility provider damages a water line, sewer line or lateral
pipe and causes the village or any other person to incur expenses associated
with repairing the damage to the line caused by the utility provider, the
utility provider shall be liable for the costs of all repairs and damages
incurred by the village or private party as a result of the utility provider’s
damage to a water line, sewer line, or lateral pipe.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.66 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for variance. A utility provider requesting a variance from
one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the
Village Foreman as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Village Foreman shall decide whether
a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Village Foreman may authorize
a variance only if the utility provider requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility
provider (such as terrain features or an irregular public way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations, or facilities
that would conform to the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village Foreman may require the utility provider
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter, but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility provider, aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision, or determination, including denial of a variance, made
by the Village Foreman under the provisions of this chapter shall have the
right to appeal to the Village President for the village. The application for
appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk for the village
within 30 calendar days after the date of such order, requirement, decision, or
determination. The Village President shall issue a decision on the appeal
within 14 calendar days after the filing of the appeal.
(Ord. 1008, passed 6-21-2023)
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person, permittee, utility provider or entity which violates,
disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a civil
ordinance violation and shall be fined not less than $250 nor more than $750
for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed to be committed on each
day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. In addition to any
fine, the village may seek injunctive and declaratory relief directing the
violator(s) to cure the violation, and the village may revoke any permit
authorized and issued pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs,
including third party claims, because the person, permittee, or utility
provider will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the person, permittee, or utility provider shows another
allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the
person, permittee, or utility provider shall bear the village costs of damages
and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing
the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency
or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the
village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility provider which does not pay
the costs apportioned to it.
   (C)   Every act or omission of whatsoever nature constituting a violation of
any provision of this chapter, by any officer, director, manager or other agent
or employee of any person, permittee, or utility provider, shall be deemed and
held to be the act of such person, permittee, or utility provider and the
person, permittee, or utility provider shall be punishable in the same manner
as if the act or omission had been done or omitted by him or her personally.
