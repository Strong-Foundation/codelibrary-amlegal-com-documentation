No provision of this code designating the duties of any officer or employee
shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine
or penalty for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of the city
council to impose such fine or penalty on such officer or employee is
specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty. (1964

1-8H-8: HEARING PROCEDURES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Rights: Parties shall be provided with an opportunity for a hearing
before or during which they may exercise any or all of the following rights:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Be represented by counsel, at their own expense. Respondents shall
not be entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent them;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Present and cross examine witnesses; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Request the Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas to direct the
attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant
tangible evidence.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Rules Of Evidence Shall Not Govern: The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in an administrative adjudication hearing authorized
under this article. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is
the type commonly relied upon by reasonable prudent persons in the conduct of
their affairs.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Standard Of Proof: Administrative adjudication hearings are civil in
nature. The City shall bear the standard of proof to prove by a preponderance
of the evidence the occurrence or existence of a violation of the Code. A
sworn, written pleading, complaint or citation shall constitute a prima facie
evidence of the violation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Recording: All administrative adjudication hearings conducted pursuant
to this article shall be recorded.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Defenses: It shall be a defense to a Code violation charged under this
article if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent or representative proves
by a preponderance of the evidence that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The Code violation alleged in the notice did not in fact exist at
the time of the citation, pleading or complaint; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The Code violation alleged in the notice occurred before the owner
became the owner of the real or personal property. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, any existing order to correct a Code violation and/or
sanctions imposed by the City as a result of a finding of a Code violation
under this article shall attach to the property as well as to the owner of the
property, so that a finding of a Code violation against one owner cannot be
avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any
subsequent transferee or owner of the property takes the same subject to the
findings, decision and order of a Hearing Officer under this article.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Continuances: No continuances shall be authorized by a Hearing Officer
for any administrative adjudication hearing commenced under this article except
in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of
the respondent or owner. Any continuance authorized by the Hearing Officer
shall not exceed twenty five (25) days. Lack of preparation shall not be
grounds for a continuance.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Default: If on the date set for hearing the respondent or his/her
attorney fails to appear, the Hearing Officer may find the respondent in
default and shall proceed.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Contents Of Final Determination Of Liability: A final determination of
liability as determined by the Hearing Officer shall be provided to the parties
following the conclusion of an administrative hearing by personally providing
such or, in the case of a default judgment, by mailing within five (5) business
days of the date the order is issued and shall contain, but not be limited to,
the following information and warnings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A decision and order stating whether a Code violation exists;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A statement of any penalties or sanctions imposed which penalties or
sanctions debts are due and owing the City;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A statement of any finding of costs imposed if a Code violation is
found to exist, which costs shall be debts due and owing the City;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A statement of any sanctions imposed including, but not limited to,
orders to abate, injunctions, orders to cease and desist, orders to perform
community service and other appropriate orders as determined by the Hearing
Officer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A warning that failure to comply with any orders to abate, cease and
desist, perform community service or other appropriate order and/or pay the
fine and any penalty due and owing the City within the time specified may
result in proceeding with collection and enforcement procedures in the same
manner as a judgment entered by any court of competent jurisdiction; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Any other warning of possible impoundment as permitted by law or
ordinance.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Final Determination Of Liability: A final determination of liability
shall occur following the failure to pay the fine or penalty or comply with
other imposed sanctions after the Hearing Officer's determination of liability
and the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, any administrative review
procedures hereinafter set forth. Where a person fails to appear at the
administrative hearing to contest the alleged violation on the date and at the
time and place specified in a prior served or mailed notice, the Hearing
Officer's determination of liability shall become final either upon a denial of
a timely petition to set aside that determination or upon the expiration of the
period for filing a petition without a filing having been made. Failure by any
respondent to pay or mail payment of the fine for any violation of this City
Code within thirty five (35) days of the issuance of the final determination of
liability will automatically subject the respondent to a penalty for late
payment. The penalty for late payment shall be the amount set forth in section
1-8H-17, "Penalties", of this article. Failure to pay or mail payment of the
fine may result in the fine being referred to a collection agency and will
automatically subject the respondent to an additional administrative fee of
twenty five dollars ($25.00).
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Judicial Review: Any final decision by a Hearing Officer that a Code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law, 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., or
as hereinafter amended. Any person filing for judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law shall be subject to the assessment costs for the
preparation and certification of the record of proceedings before the Hearing
Officer. Such cost shall be assessed as one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the
first page of the transcript and twenty five dollars ($25.00) for each page
thereafter. Any failure to pay such fee shall subject the party seeking review
to the provisions of 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-109, including
dismissal of the complaint on motion of the City. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd.
Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-9: ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Any final decision by a Hearing Officer that a Code violation does or
does not exist shall constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law. The findings, decision and
order of the Hearing Officer shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to a review in the Circuit
Court of Coles County, Illinois, and the provisions of the Administrative
Review Law and all amendments and modifications thereto, and the rules adopted
pursuant thereto are adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the
judicial review of the final findings, decision and order of a Hearing Officer
under this article. The plaintiff in the administrative review proceeding shall
pay to the City of Charleston the costs of preparing and certifying the record
of proceedings before the Hearing Officer. The failure to make that payment
shall relieve the City of the necessity of filing the answer required by 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-108 (Illinois Administrative Review Law) and
shall be authority for the entry of an order by the court, on motion thereof by
the City or any other respondent, dismissing the complaint. Any fine, other
sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction or cost imposed,
remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial
review procedures under the Illinois Administrative Review Law are a debt due
and owing the City and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Failure of the respondent to pay such fine or penalty after the
exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may result in the City filing a petition in
the Circuit Court of Coles County to have reduced to judgment any unpaid fine
or penalty with costs, and, if applicable: 1) the immobilization of the
person's vehicle for failure to pay fines or penalties for five (5) or more
parking violations and 2) the suspension of the person's driver's license for
failure to pay fines or penalties for ten (10) or more parking violations.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall prevent the City of Charleston from
consolidating multiple findings, decisions and orders against a person in such
a proceeding.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Upon commencement of an action to enforce, the City shall file a
certified copy of the findings, decision and order, which shall be accompanied
by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings,
decision and order, was issued in accordance with this Code. Service of the
summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by the Code of
Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the court is
satisfied that the findings, decision and order were entered in accordance with
the requirements of this section and the applicable ordinance and that the
respondent had an opportunity for a hearing and for judicial review as provided
for herein: 1) the court shall render a judgment in favor of the City and
against the respondent for the relief indicated in the findings, decision and
order, plus costs. Such judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced
in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money; and 2) the
court may also issue such other orders and injunction as are requested by the
City to enforce the order of the Hearing Officer. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd.
Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-10: ALTERNATIVE ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In place of a proceeding under section
1-8H-9 of this article, after expiration of the period in which judicial review
under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final
determination of a Code violation other than a Building Code violation, unless
stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision, and order
of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any case in which a respondent has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering a respondent to correct a Code violation other than a Building Code
violation, or imposing any fine or other sanction as a result of a Code
violation other than a Building Code violation, any expenses incurred by the
City to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorney fees,
court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after
they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or a Hearing Officer, shall
be a debt due and owing the City and may be collected in accordance with
applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by a Hearing Officer pursuant
to this subsection, the City shall provide notice to the respondent that states
that the respondent shall appear at a hearing before the Administrative Hearing
Officer to determine whether the respondent has failed to comply with the
judgment. The notice shall set the date for such a hearing, which shall not be
less than seven (7) days from the date that notice is served. If notice is
served by mail, the seven (7) day period shall begin to run on the date that
the notice was deposited in the mail.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Upon being recorded in the manner required by article XII of the Code
of Civil Procedure or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed
on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the respondent in the amount
of any debt due and owing the Municipality under this section. The lien may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â A Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default and set
a new hearing date, upon a petition filed within twenty one (21) days after the
issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing Officer determines that the
petitioner's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause or at any time
if the petitioner establishes that the City did not provide proper service of
process. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this section, the Hearing
Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has
been recorded for any debt due and owing the City as a result of the vacated
default judgment. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd. Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-11: MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATIONS; CITATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the
Code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking, stopping or standing, the
owner shall be prima facie responsible for the violation and subject to the
penalty thereof.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the
Code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking, stopping or standing, any
law enforcement officer, traffic control aide, other designated member of law
enforcement, parking enforcement aide or other person designated by the Code
Administrator observing such violation may issue a parking violation notice,
and serve the notice on the owner of the vehicle by handing it to the operator
of the vehicle, if he is present, or by affixing it to the vehicle in a
conspicuous place. The issuer of the notice shall specify on the notice his
identification number, the particular parking regulation allegedly violated,
the make and state registration number of the cited vehicle, and the place,
date and time and nature of the alleged violation and shall certify the
correctness of the specified information by signing his name as provided in
section 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/11-208.3, as amended. The foregoing shall not relieve the Code Administrator
from the duties set forth in section
1-8H-7 of this article with respect to scheduling a hearing on such alleged
violation and providing notice thereof.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â It shall be unlawful for any person, other than the owner of the
vehicle or his designee, to remove from a vehicle a parking violation notice
affixed pursuant to this article.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The Code Administrator shall distribute parking violation notices to
parking enforcement aides, other persons authorized to issue parking violation
notices, and law enforcement for issuance pursuant to these provisions. All
parking enforcement aides, other persons authorized to issue parking violation
notices, and law enforcement must retain a receipt for every notice issued.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The Code Administrator shall compile and maintain complete and accurate
records relating to all parking violation notices issued and the dispositions
thereof, whether by payment of the fine or by final determination of the
Hearing Officer. In addition, the Code Administrator shall make certified
reports to the Secretary of State pursuant to section 6-306.5 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd. Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-12: DETERMINATION OF LIABILITY; MOTOR VEHICLE CITATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Final Determination: Where a respondent either fails to pay the
indicated fine prior to the hearing or fails to appear at a hearing, a final
determination of parking violation liability shall be entered in the amount of
the fine indicated on the notice of violation. Failure to pay the fine within
thirty five (35) business days of a final determination of parking violation
liability will result in the imposition of a late payment penalty pursuant to
subsection B of this section. Upon the occurrence of a final determination of
parking violation liability and after expiration of the period in which
judicial review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought any
unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the City.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Late Payment: Failure by any respondent to pay or mail payment of the
fine for a parking violation within thirty five (35) days of the issuance of
the final determination of liability will automatically subject the respondent
to a penalty for late payment. The penalty for late payment shall be the amount
set forth in section
1-8H-17, "Penalties", of this article. Failure to pay or mail payment of the
fine after a sixty (60) day period commencing on the issuance of the final
determination of liability will result in the fine being referred to a
collection agency and will automatically subject the respondent to an
additional administrative fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Defenses: A person charged with a parking violation may contest the
charge through an administrative adjudication hearing limited to one (1) or
more of the following grounds with appropriate evidence to support:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â That the respondent was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle
at the time of the violation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â That the cited vehicle or its state registration plates were stolen
at the time the violation occurred;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â That the relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking, if
necessary, were missing or obscured;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â That the relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned
through no fault of the respondent;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â That the facts alleged in the parking violation notice are
inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was
violated. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd. Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-13: LESSOR OF VEHICLE; LIABILITY:
In accordance with section 11-1306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, no person who
is the lessor of a vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be
liable for a violation for any standing or parking regulation of this Code
involving such vehicle during the period of the lease if upon the receipt of a
notice of violation he shall, within sixty (60) days thereafter, provide to the
Code Administrator the name and address of the lessee. Upon receipt of a
lessor's notification of the name and address of his lessee, pursuant to
section 11-1305 or 11-1306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, the Code Administrator
shall cause a notice of violation to be sent to the lessee as provided herein.
If the lessor fails to provide the Code Administrator with the name and address
of the lessee within sixty (60) days of receiving notice, the lessor shall be
liable for the full amount of the violation and late penalties, and a final
determination will be issued. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd. Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-
2017)
1-8H-14: IMMOBILIZATION PROGRAM:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Code Administrator is hereby authorized to direct and supervise a
Program of Vehicle Immobilization for the purpose of enforcing the parking
regulations of the Code. The Program of Vehicle Immobilization shall provide
for immobilizing of any eligible vehicle, as defined in subsection B of this
section, by placement of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent its
operation.
If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of the
Traffic Code for which such vehicle is subject to an immediate tow, or in any
place where it constitutes an obstruction or hazard, or where it impedes City
workers during such operations as snow removal, the Code Administrator may
cause the eligible vehicle immediately to be towed to a vehicle pound or
relocated to a legal parking place and there restrained.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When the registered owner of a vehicle has accumulated five (5) or more
final determinations of parking violation liability for which the fines and
penalties, if applicable, have not been paid in full, the Code Administrator
shall cause a notice of impending vehicle immobilization to be sent as
prescribed in this article.
The notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall state the name and address
of the registered owner, the state registration number of the vehicle or
vehicles registered to such owner, and the serial numbers of parking violation
notices which have resulted in final determination of liability for which the
fines or penalties remain unpaid. Failure to pay the fines and penalties owed
within thirty five (35) days from the date of the notice will result in the
inclusion of the state registration number of the vehicle of such owner on an
immobilization list. A person may challenge the validity of the notice of
impending vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in
person to submit evidence which would conclusively disprove eligibility. Such
hearing shall not be a forum to readjudicate the findings of fact and law
issued by the Hearing Officer. Upon a request for a hearing, the Code
Administrator shall schedule the hearing for the next regular hearing date.
Documentary evidence which would conclusively disprove liability shall be based
on the following grounds:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â That all fines and penalties for the parking violations cited in the
notice have been paid in full; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â That the registered owner has not accumulated five (5) or more final
determinations of parking violation liability which were unpaid at the time the
notice of impending vehicle immobilization was issued.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be affixed
to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the vehicle
is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its
damage. The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal or damage to
the immobilizing restraint is a violation of sections 16-1 and 21-1 of the
Illinois Criminal Code. The notice shall also provide information specifying
how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered
owner may obtain an immobilization hearing. If the restraint has not been
released within twenty four (24) hours of its placement, the restraint shall be
released and the vehicle towed and impounded.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may
secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and
storage fees provided in subsection G of this section, and all fines and
penalties remaining due on each final determination of parking violation
liability issued to such person.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a hearing
to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing and
impoundment was erroneous, if the owner files a written request for a hearing
with the Code Administrator within fourteen (14) days after immobilization or
fourteen (14) days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to subsection F of
this section, whichever is later. Such hearing shall not be a forum to
readjudicate the findings of fact and law issued by the Hearing Officer. The
determination of the Hearing Officer regarding the validity of the
immobilization shall become final for the purpose of judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law of Illinois upon issuance. The owner shall be limited
to the same defenses prescribed in subsection B of this section.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Within ten (10) days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of
impoundment shall be sent by first class mail, to the address of the registered
owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that the
owner has the right to request a postimmobilization and posttowing hearing as
provided in subsection E of this section, and that if the vehicle is not
claimed within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be
sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 4-208 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The fee for immobilization shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). In
addition, a fee for towing subsequent to the immobilization and a storage fee
for every twenty four (24) hour period the vehicle is retained shall be
assessed. No fees shall be assessed for any immobilization or tow which has
been determined to be erroneous.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â It shall be unlawful to relocate any vehicle restrained by an
immobilization device without the approval of the Code Administrator or his
designee. The registered owner of the immobilized vehicle and any person who
relocates an immobilized vehicle in violation of this subsection shall each be
subject to a penalty of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each such
violation. (Ord. 16-O-23, 6-7-2016; amd. Ord. 17-O-26, 7-5-2017)
1-8H-15: DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â When a person has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
pursuant to this article on ten (10) or more parking violations, the Code
Administrator shall cause a notice of impending driver's license suspension to
be sent in the form as required by the Secretary of State. The notice shall
state that failure to pay the amount owing within forty five (45) days of the

1-13-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The City of Charleston ("City") is committed to a work environment in which all
individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right
to work in a professional atmosphere that prohibits discriminatory practices,
including sexual harassment. Therefore, the City expects that all relationships
among persons in the workplace, including relationships with members of the
public, will be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment.
It is the responsibility of each and every employee, officer, official, member,
agent, volunteer, and vendor of the City as well as anyone using the City's
facilities, to refrain from sexual harassment. The City will not tolerate
sexual harassment of or by any of its employees and elected officials. Actions,
words, jokes, or comments based on an individual's sex, sexual identity or
orientation, civil union partnership, or any other form of sex discrimination
or harassment will not be tolerated.
This policy should not, and may not, be used as a basis for excluding or
separating individuals of a particular gender, sexual orientation, civil union
partnership, or any other protected characteristic, from participating in
business or work-related social activities or discussions in order to avoid
allegations of harassment. The law and policies of the City prohibit disparate
treatment based on race, religion, age, national origin, sex, sexual identity
or orientation, civil union partnership, or any other protected characteristic,
with regard to terms, conditions, privileges and prerequisites of employment.
The prohibition against sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation are
intended to complement and further these policies, not to form the basis of an
exception to them.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
Sexual harassment means any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual
favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as
the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment. For purposes of this definition, the phrase
"working environment" is not limited to a physical location an employee is
assigned to perform his or her duties and does not require an employment
relationship.
Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not so subtle behaviors and
may involve individuals of the same or different gender. Depending on the
circumstances, these behaviors may include, but are not limited to: unwanted
sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual's body, sexual
prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering; catcalls or touching; insulting or
obscene comments or gestures; display or circulation in the workplace of
sexually suggestive objects or pictures (including through e-mail, text
messages or other workplace communications); and other physical, verbal or
visual conduct of a sexual nature.
Sexual harassment against employees, independent contractors, elected
officials, members of the public, and anyone else in the workplace is expressly
prohibited. Moreover, sexual harassment is expressly prohibited in any work-
related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips,
professional conferences, business meetings and business-related and/or the
City sponsored social events.
Any employee who engages in practices or conduct constituting sexual harassment
shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Any
official of the City who engages in practices or conduct constituting sexual
harassment shall be subject to appropriate remedial action, up to and including
removal from office.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-3: RETALIATION IS PROHIBITED:
The City prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports sexual
harassment, participates in an investigation of such reports, or files a charge
of sexual harassment. Retaliation against an individual for reporting sexual
harassment, for participating in an investigation of a claim of sexual
harassment, or for filing a charge of sexual harassment is a serious violation
of this policy and, like sexual harassment itself, will result in disciplinary
action, up to and including termination or removal from office against the
retaliator.
Should you be subjected to retaliation for reporting sexual harassment,
participating in the investigation of any such report, or for filing a charge
of sexual harassment with the Illinois Department of Human Rights or any other
federal, state, or local governmental agency with jurisdiction over such a
charge, you have the right to file a charge with the Illinois Department of
Human Rights at the James R. Thompson Center, 100 West Randolph Street, Suite
10-100, Chicago, Illinois 60601, (312) 814-6200, or filing a civil action
against the retaliator under the Illinois Whistleblower Act. You also may have
recourse under the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-4: REPORTING PROCEDURE:
The City strongly urges the reporting of all incidents of sexual harassment or
retaliation, regardless of the offender's identity or position. Early reporting
and intervention have proven to be essential to the resolution of actual or
perceived incidents of harassment. Therefore, while no fixed reporting period
has been established, the City strongly urges the prompt reporting of
complaints or concerns so that rapid and constructive action can be taken.
The availability of this reporting procedure does not preclude individuals who
believe they are being subjected to sexual harassment from promptly advising
the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome and requesting that it be
discontinued.
If you experience or witness sexual harassment, you should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by reporting the incident(s) to
your immediate supervisor, your department head, and/or the City Manager. If
the City Manager is the subject of the complaint, then the employee should
report directly to the Mayor. You should also document or record each incident
(what was said or done, by whom, the date, time and place, and any witnesses to
the incident). Written records such as letters, notes, memos, e-mails, and
telephone messages can strengthen documentation. It is not necessary that the
harassment be directed at you to make a complaint. Following are steps you can
take in the reporting process:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Direct Communication With The Offender: If you experience or witness
sexual harassment, you should directly and clearly express your objection to
the offending person(s) regardless of whether the behavior is directed at you.
If you are the harassed employee, you should clearly state that the conduct is
unwelcome and the offending behavior must stop. However, you are not required
to directly confront the person who is the source of your report, question, or
complaint before notifying any of those individuals listed below.Â Â Â The initial
message may be oral or written, but documentation of the notice should be made.
If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Report To Supervisory And Administrative Personnel: At the same time,
direct communication is undertaken, or in the event you feel threatened or
intimidated by the offending person, you should promptly report the offending
behavior to your immediate supervisor, department head or the City Manager. If
you feel uncomfortable doing so, or if your immediate supervisor and/or
department head is the source of the problem, condones the problem or ignores
the problem, report directly to the City Manager. If the City Manager is the
source of the problem, condones the problem, or ignores the problem, you should
contact the Mayor.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Report To City Manager/Mayor: An employee may also report incidents of
harassment or discrimination directly to the City Manager. The City Manager or
his or her designee will promptly investigate the facts and take corrective
action when an allegation is determined to be valid. If your complaint alleges
harassment by the City Manager, or if the City Manager condones the problem or
ignores the problem, you should immediately report the incident or incidents in
writing directly to the Mayor. An investigation will be conducted and
appropriate action will be taken when an allegation is determined to be valid.
At no time will personnel involved in the alleged harassment conduct the
investigation.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â You have the right at any time to contact the Illinois Department of
Human Rights (IDHR) at the address and/or telephone number listed above, about
filing a formal complaint. Thereafter, depending upon the results of the IDHR's
investigation and the time required to complete the investigation, the IDHR may
file a complaint with the Illinois Human Rights Commission (HRC), located at
100 W. Randolph St., Ste. 5-100, (312) 814-6269, or you may have the right to
file a complaint on your own behalf either in circuit court or directly with
the HRC.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In addition to the methods of reporting included above, any elected
official, employee, non-employee, or patron may file a sexual harassment
complaint with the attorney for the City of Charleston. This complaint will be
promptly reviewed and investigated privately. A written report will then be
submitted to the City Council including findings of fact and a determination of
whether the complaint is founded. If the complaint is founded the City Council
shall determine the appropriate remedy. Pursuant to the protections set forth
in this policy and Illinois law, no retaliation may be taken against any person
who files a complaint. Complaints may also be filed with the Illinois Human
Rights Department, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
the United States Department of Justice, and other federal or state agencies.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-5: COMPLAINTS AGAINST NON-EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES:
If you make a complaint alleging sexual harassment against an agent, vendor,
supplier, contractor, volunteer or person using the City programs or
facilities, the City Manager will investigate the incident(s) and determine the
appropriate action, if any. The City will make reasonable efforts to protect
you from further contact with such persons.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-6: RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPERVISORS AND WITNESSES:
Any supervisor who becomes aware of any possible sexual or other harassment or
discrimination of or by any employee should immediately advise the City
Manager, who will investigate the conduct and resolve the matter as soon as
possible. All employees are encouraged to report incidents of harassment,
regardless of who the offender may be or whether or not you are the intended
victim.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-7: INVESTIGATION:
Any reported allegations of sexual harassment will be investigated promptly.
The City will make every reasonable effort to conduct an investigation in a
responsible and confidential manner. However, it is impossible to guarantee
absolute confidentiality. The investigation may include individual interviews
with the parties involved, and where necessary, with individuals who may have
observed the alleged conduct or may have other relevant knowledge. The City
serves notice that third parties, including attorneys for the City, may be used
to investigate claims of sexual harassment.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-8: FALSE AND FRIVOLOUS COMPLAINTS:
Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false and
frivolous charge of harassment is a major offense that can itself result in
disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, or, in the case of an
officer, suspension or removal from an elected or appointed position. False and
frivolous complaints are those accusations with respect to which the accuser is
using a harassment complaint to accomplish an end other than stopping the
harassment. The term does not refer to charges made in good faith that cannot
be proved.
(Ord. 18-O-2, 1-2-2018, eff. 1-2-2018; amd. Ord. 20-O-27, 10-6-2020)
1-13-9: RESPONSIVE ACTION:
Subject to legal guidelines, the City will make the initial determination as to
whether sexual harassment has occurred based on a review of the facts and
circumstances of each situation. Misconduct constituting sexual harassment or
retaliation will be dealt with appropriately. Responsive action may include,
for example, training, referral to counseling and/or disciplinary action such
as warning, reprimand, withholding of a promotion or pay increase, reassignment
or demotion, temporary suspension without pay, termination, or, in the case of
an officer, removal from an elected or appointed position, as the City believes
appropriate under the circumstances.

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this chapter from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the city manager may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three (3) years

limitations.

determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the
city for the city infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the
amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the

of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs
incurred by the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five
percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit.
Said sum shall be paid to the city within twenty one (21) days after the date
of issuance of an invoice for same.

the right to a renewal or reissue thereof to another qualified and eligible
person in accordance with the procedure hereinafter set forth, who, upon full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter then in force in the City

reissue of such license in his, their, or its own name and which holder of a
license, in turn, may assign or convey such right to renewal or reissue of such
license upon the same terms and conditions as the original owner thereof could
do hereunder; provided, however, that the privilege of renewal and reissue
provided in this subsection shall apply only so long as the license in each
case shall have been kept in force continually and uninterruptedly in the name
of the licensee or his successor in interest, in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations, nothing herein provided shall be deemed to restrict the
right of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner to revoke any such assignment of
license and require further proceedings.

an application for a liquor license as if such assignee were applying for a new

assignments shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and approved by formal
action of the Local Liquor Control Commissioner and the Local Liquor

such assignments. Upon the filing of any such assignment, the Local Liquor
Control Commissioner shall endorse thereon the time of filing, and upon
compliance by the assignee with all the laws then in force pertaining to the
qualifications of an applicant for such license and the surrender of the old
license for cancellation, there shall (unless the old license shall have been

assignment, a license for the same place as that specified in the old license,

covered by the license so surrendered; upon condition, however, that such new

2018)
7-6-5: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application Deadlines For Small Wireless Facilities: Applications are
deemed complete if the City does not notify the applicant otherwise within
thirty (30) days of receipt of the application.
If the application to collocate a small wireless facility is to be placed on an
existing utility pole, the City will notify the applicant of its approval or
denial within ninety (90) days. If the City fails to notify the applicant
within that timeframe, the application will be deemed approved. If the
application to collocate a small wireless facility requires the installation of
a new utility pole, the City will notify the applicant of its approval or
denial within one hundred twenty (120) days. If the City fails to notify the
applicant within that timeframe, the application will be deemed approved.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â City Review Of Permit Applications: Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the City Director
of Public Works on a nondiscriminatory basis. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
or regulations that concern public safety, the City Director of Public Works
shall notify the applicant of the basis for a denial, including specific code
provisions upon which the denial was based. The applicant may cure the
deficiencies and resubmit a revised application without paying additional
application fees.
When reviewing applications for small wireless facilities, the City will
approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it will be deemed approved. If the City
Director of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this chapter and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the City Director of Public Works shall issue a permit.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Additional City Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications Retailers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pursuant to section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the City
that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the City not less than ten (10) days prior to
the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The City Director
of Public Works shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In the event that the City Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within
either: a) ten (10) days after service of notice to the City by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Upon the provision of such specification by the City, where a permit
is required for work pursuant to section
7-6-4 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the City
an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection B of this
section. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on City rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the City
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
City and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Duration: Collocation of small wireless facilities must be completed
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the issuance of the permit. If
collocation is not complete, the permit will be void. Permits for small
wireless facilities are valid for five (5) years from the time of issuance.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Annual Recurring Rates For Small Wireless Facilities: The City shall
charge an annual recurring rate for the collocation of small wireless
facilities on Municipally-owned infrastructure located in its right-of-way
equal to either two hundred dollars ($200.00) per utility pole, or the actual,
direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on
the City utility pole, whichever is greater. If the City elects to charge the
actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of
space on the Municipally-owned infrastructure, it shall adopt a fee schedule on
an annual basis. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City within ninety (90) days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
7-6-22 of this chapter. If the City denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-8: INSURANCE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each wireless provider or utility occupying
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and
maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the wireless
provider or utility as named insured and naming the City, and its elected and
appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on
the policies listed in subsections A1 and A2 of this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Wireless providers must include the City as an additional insured
on the commercial general liability policy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Workers' compensation with statutory limits;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Property insurance for replacement costs against all risks.
If the wireless provider or utility is not providing such insurance to protect
the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors
and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Copies Required: The wireless provider or utility shall provide copies
of any of the policies required by this section to the City within ten (10)
days following receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the City Manager of such intent to cancel or not to
renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the wireless provider or
utility shall obtain and furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this section.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Self-Insurance: A wireless provider or utility may self-insure all or a

required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement
for the naming of additional insureds under subsection A of this section, or
the requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section. A wireless provider
or utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A of this section,
such as evidence that the wireless provider or utility is a "private self-
insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Wireless Provider's Or
Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the wireless provider or utility to
the City and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self- insurance required by this section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a wireless
provider or utility shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
City and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to
arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts,
omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the wireless provider or utility or
its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in
the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the wireless
provider's or utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by
the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord.
18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-10: SECURITY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the City Director of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the City Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Withdrawals: The City, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund,
the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the City,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the City with respect to the
Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other
right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)

chapter, with respect to the work and facilities in the right-of-way.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the City's right-of-
way.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. 18-O-21,

7-6-14: PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC CONTROL:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Public Safety: The placement of any antenna, wireless facility or small
wireless facilities located in the City right-of-way may not interfere with the
frequencies used by public safety agencies for public safety communications.
Unacceptable interference will be determined in accordance with industry
standards and the Federal Communications Commission's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum. If an antenna, wireless
facility or small wireless facility causes such interference, the owner must
take all steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference at its own
costs. The City may terminate a permit for any antenna, wireless facility or
small wireless facility based on such interference if the interference is not
corrected.
The City may reserve space on its utility pole for future public safety uses.
This reservation of space may preclude the collocation of a small wireless
facility where the City determines that the utility pole cannot accommodate
both uses.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimum Requirements: The City's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's "Illinois Manual On Uniform Traffic Control
Devices" and this Code.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Warning Signs, Protective Devices, And Flaggers: The wireless provider
or utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs,
protective devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting all applicable
Federal, State, and local requirements for protection of the public and the
wireless provider's or utility's workers when performing any work on the public
rights-of-way.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Interference With Traffic: All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Notice When Access Is Blocked: At least forty eight (48) hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the wireless provider or utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and
duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency
repairs pursuant to section
7-6-21 of this chapter, the wireless provider or utility shall provide such
notice as is practicable under the circumstances.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Compliance: The wireless provider or utility shall take immediate
action to correct any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are
brought to the its attention by the City. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-15: LOCATION OF FACILITIES:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Small Wireless Facilities: The City is not required to install or
maintain any specific utility pole or to continue to install or maintain
utility poles in any location if it makes a non- discriminatory decision to
eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type. For City utility
poles with collocated small wireless facilities in place when the City makes a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles, the City will, at its
discretion, either maintain the utility pole or install and maintain an
alternative utility pole for the collocation of the small wireless facility, or
offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider.

provided in the initial installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Markers: The City may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 CFR section 192.707
(1989)).
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights-Of-Way: The City may
require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are not
highways, rather than within particular highways.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Freestanding Facilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Small Wireless Facilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The City may not require the placement of a small wireless
facility on a specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the
application necessitate the installation of a new utility pole, the City may
propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility
pole or existing support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the
proposed collocation. Should the applicant reject the proposed relocated
collocation, it must provide a written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternative location will
not satisfy the wireless provider's needs. The City may require any monopole,
utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be
screened from view in compliance with the appearance standards described below.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other Facilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The City may restrict the location and size of any monopole,
utility pole or other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No
freestanding facility located within a right-of- way may be constructed or
modified so that the height of the freestanding facility is higher by more than
ten feet (10') or more than ten percent (10%), whichever is greater, than any
other existing, freestanding facility located within the right-of-way within
three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility, measured along the center
line of the respective right-of-way. Where there are no other freestanding
facilities located within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed facility,
the maximum height of the freestanding facility shall be forty five feet (45').
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The City may require any monopole, utility pole or other
freestanding facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground
facilities are located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles,
utility poles and other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same
side of the right-of-way as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist
above ground facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be
located on the side where the above ground facilities most closely match the
scale of the new freestanding facility.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Appearance Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The City may prohibit the installation of facilities in particular
locations in order to preserve visual quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the highway user or impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Aboveground Installation: Aboveground facilities may be installed only
if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and Municipally-owned infrastructure shall be
used wherever practicable; the installation of additional utility poles or
monopoles is strongly discouraged.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Facility Attachments To Bridges Or Roadway Structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the wireless provider or utility has demonstrated that
all other means of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means
shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent
poles, cable supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated
from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that
are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A wireless provider or utility shall include in its request to
accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting
data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or
disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway
structure will be based upon the following considerations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The alternative routings available to the wireless provider or
utility and their comparative practicability;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The proposed method of attachment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The public benefit expected from the wireless provider or utility
service as compared to the risk involved.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Height Restrictions For Small Wireless Facilities: Small wireless
facilities are limited to a maximum height of ten feet (10') above the utility
pole or wireless structure on which it is collocated. The height limit of a new
or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure on which small
wireless facilities are collocated is limited to the higher of: 1) ten feet
(10') higher than the tallest existing utility pole within three hundred feet
(300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
that is in the same right-of-way; or 2) forty five feet (45') above ground
level. The City shall designate which intersecting right-of-way within three
hundred feet (300') of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structure
shall control the height limitation. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Residential Design Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: Ensure visually acceptable facility design and to provide
discretion on required and preferred design of small wireless facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: These design standards shall apply to each facility
located in a district zoned for residential uses:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Applicants must use architectural treatments and stealth
techniques to reduce potential visual impacts from all small wireless
facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â All new utility poles installed for the purpose of mounting a
facility must be stealth or camouflaged to blend into the surrounding
environment. Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are presented in figure
1 of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Small wireless facilities and all ancillary equipment associated
with the facility must not emit sound.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Cables must be routed directly from the ground through the pole
and equipment enclosures must completely enclose or hide cabling. No exposed
cable is allowed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â No flashing lights or unnecessary, non-essential stickers are
allowed to be placed on any facility. Stickers must be designed in the same
color as the pole to which they are attached.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â In no case shall equipment block the sidewalk or pedestrian
pathway. All installations must maintain accessibility requirements and
standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â All newly installed equipment must be painted with graffiti-
resistant paint to match pole color and surroundings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Colors and materials for small wireless facilities shall be
chosen to minimize the visibility of the facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Antennas attached to existing poles or Municipally-owned

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â Any ground-mounted facility shall be painted with non- reflective
matte finish paint using color shades that are comparable or blend with
surrounding natural elements such as soil, trees, or grasslands. Any ground-
mounted facility shall be screened from the yard of the property in front of
which it is located using year-round landscaping materials. The owner of the
ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the landscaping materials for a period
of one year from planting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â All disturbed pavement and landscaping shall be replaced and
areas of bare or disturbed soils must be re-vegetated. If replacement landscape
is determined to be infeasible the City may accept mitigation funds to use
elsewhere. The owner of the ground-mounted facility shall guarantee the
restoration work or reseeding for a period of one year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â No facility may display any signage or advertisements unless
expressly allowed by the City in a written approval, recommended under FCC
regulations or required by law or permit condition. Every facility shall at all
times display signage that accurately identifies the facility owner and
provides the facility owner's unique site number, and also provides a local or
toll-free telephone number to contact the facility owner's operations center.
All required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise
placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures.

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Design Standards In Special Aesthetic/Economic Purpose Zones:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: To protect and promote the City's unique character in a
manner consistent with State and Federal laws and regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: These design standards shall apply to: a) each area,
district, neighborhood or zone expressly designated in the City's Comprehensive
Plan as having special aesthetic or economic impacts on the welfare of the
community; and b) each redevelopment area designed under the Tax Increment
Allocation Redevelopment Act or the Business District Development and
Redevelopment Act:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Siting of small wireless facilities in special aesthetic/economic
purpose zones must respect the existing character or design ordinance of
established zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures
in their applications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Effective camouflage so as to disguise the facility so that it
appears to be something other than a facility and is at the same time
compatible with its surroundings (for example, designed to look like a tree).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Small wireless facilities must be designed so that the
facilities' silhouette, mass and color are masked in such a way as to be
virtually indistinguishable from their background.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Examples of stealth or camouflage designs are presented in figure
1 of this section.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Design Standards In Historic Districts:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: To promote the educational, cultural, economic and general
welfare of the City by identifying, preserving, protecting, enhancing and
encouraging the continued utilization and the rehabilitation of such areas,
properties, structures, sites and objects having a special historical interest
or value to the City and its citizens.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: These design standards apply in any historic district
or on any historic landmark:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Districts, sites, buildings, structures or objects, significant
in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering or culture, that are
listed, or are eligible for listing, in the National Register of Historic
Places are to be avoided, to the greatest extent possible. Local landmarked
buildings, properties, sites, or historic districts that are so recognized by
an ordinance that meets the requirements of the certified Local Government
Program of the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office are also to be
avoided, to the greatest extent possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Applicants must include proposed stealth and concealment measures
in their applications.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Applicant must implement said City-approved design concepts, and
the use of camouflage or stealth materials as necessary in order to achieve
compliance with historic preservation review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Prior to submitting an application, where the applicant submits
an application to site facilities in a historic district, the applicant must
meet with the City to discuss any potential design modifications appropriate
for the installation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â When siting a facility in a historic district, wireless provider
must avoid removing, obscuring or altering any historic material or significant
architectural features. Rehabilitation and make-ready work must not destroy the
distinguishing character of the property or its environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather
than replaced, wherever possible by means such as rust removal, caulking,
limited paint removal and reapplication of paint.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â General Design Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Applicability: These design standards apply to all small wireless

design standards must be placed so as to minimize visibility. The small
wireless facility, including all ancillary equipment and appurtenances, must be
a color that blends with the surroundings of the utility pole or Municipally-
owned infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective materials
which blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and
structures. Any wiring must be concealed within the freestanding facility or
covered with an appropriate cover.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The City may discourage the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A facility may not be installed in a manner which defeats any
existing concealment elements of the utility pole or Municipally- owned
infrastructure to which it is attached.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Facilities under common ownership or operated on the same radio
frequency shall be separated as far as practicable. (Ord. 18-O-21, 7-17-2018)
7-6-18: VEGETATION CONTROL:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming shall not be considered a
normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The City will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The City may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Chemical Use: Spraying of any type of brush killing chemicals will not
be permitted on rights-of-way unless the wireless provider or utility
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that such
spraying is the only practicable method of vegetation control. (Ord. 18-O-21,

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The City Director of Public Works
may authorize a variance only if the wireless provider or utility requesting
the variance has demonstrated that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â One or more conditions not under the control of the wireless
provider or utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way
line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the City Director of Public Works may require the
wireless provider or utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable

accordance with the latest edition of IEPA division of laboratories manual of
laboratory methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. 86-O-12, 3-4-1986)
8-2-9: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern

the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in accordance with section
8-2-10 of this chapter, by the industrial concern, provided such payments are
in accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charge system. (Ord.
86-O-12, 3-4-1986)
8-2-10: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES 1 :
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The wastewater service charge for
the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city
shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance, plus
replacement, applicable surcharges and local capital cost charge composed of a
debt service charge and a capital improvement charge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Debt Service Charge:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The debt service charge is computed by dividing the annual debt
service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service charges can be computed;
or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The debt service charge is computed by apportioning the annual
debt service on a cost per one thousand (1,000) gallon basis; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The debt service charge is computed as a fixed charge, plus a
charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Capital Improvement Charge: The capital improvement charge is levied
on all users to provide for capital improvement, extension or reconstruction
for the sewage treatment works. The capital improvement charge is computed by
apportioning the annual amount to be accrued as a cost per one thousand (1,000)
gallons or as a fixed charge per month.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Basic User Charge:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20Â°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A suspended solids (SS) content of three hundred milligrams
per liter (300 mg/l).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The basic user charge shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to
be treated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to each user class by
volume, suspended solids and BOD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and
replacement (OM&R) costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended
solids and BOD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal
sewage strength.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Compute surcharge costs per pound per one thousand (1,000)
gallons in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters
exceed the normal domestic concentrations of BOD (250 mg/l) and SS (300 mg/l).
The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred fifty milligrams per
liter (250 mg/l) and three hundred milligrams per liter (300 mg/l)
concentration for BOD and SS, respectively. Subsection D1 of this section
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Measurement Of Flow:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of one hundred (100) gallons.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by
the city for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these
other sources.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the city if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the city.

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Certificate Required: A certificate of appropriateness issued by the
commission shall be required before a building permit, moving permit, or
demolition permit is issued for any designated historic landmark or any
building, structure or site or part thereof in the historic district. A
certificate of appropriateness is required if the building, structure or site
will be altered, extended, or repaired in such a manner as to produce a major
change in the exterior appearance of such building or structure. Such major
changes include, but are not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Major changes by addition, alteration, maintenance, reconstruction,

designating the landmark or historic district.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Exemptions From Certificate:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An exception to the certificate of appropriateness shall be made if
the applicant shows to the city planner that a failure to grant the permit will
cause an imminent threat to life, health or property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for paint,
landscaping, fencing, or driveways; provided, that said landscaping, fencing or
driveway work or repair does not alter the location of said landscaping,
fencing or driveways, and does not result in an alteration of the footprint of
the structure, landscape area or fence or driveway location. In the event there
is an effect on the landscape area or fence or driveway, then the certificate
of appropriateness is at the discretion of the city planner in consultation
with the chairman of the commission.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Application: Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be
made available at city hall. Such applications shall be completed and submitted
to city hall and shall be forwarded to the Charleston historic preservation
commission. Every application affecting a designated historic landmark or any
building, structure or site or part thereof in a historic district for a
demolition permit, a building permit, or a moving permit, including plans and
specifications, shall be forwarded by the planning department to the historic
preservation commission within seven (7) days following receipt of the
application by city hall. The application for issuance of a certificate of

or use proposed, together with any architect drawings or sketches if those
services have been utilized by the applicant, and if not, a sufficient
description of the construction, alteration, demolition, and use to enable the
commission to determine what final appearance and use of the real estate will
be.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Owner's name.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Developer's name, if different from owner. (Ord. 04-O-51, 10-19-
2004)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Name of architect/engineer, if used.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Standards: In making a determination whether to approve or deny an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Charleston historic
preservation commission shall be guided by the secretary of the interior's
"Standards For Rehabilitation".
The standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a
reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical
feasibility. Said standards being:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of the
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(Ord. 06-O-48, 11-7-2006)
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Design Guidelines: Design guidelines for applying the criteria for
review of certificates of appropriateness shall, at a minimum, consider the
following architectural criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should
be compatible with the style and character of the landmark or of contributing
structures within a designated district and with surrounding structures in a
historic district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Proportions Of Windows And Doors: The proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and
character of the landmark or of contributing structures within a designated
district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: The relationship of a
structure within a historic district to the open space between it and adjoining
structures should be compatible.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Roof Shape: The design of the roof, fascia, and cornice should be
compatible with the architectural style and character of the landmark or of
contributing structures within a designated district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration, construction, or
partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with surrounding structures in a historic district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Directional Expression: Facades in historic districts should blend
with other structures with regard to directional expression. Structures in a
historic district should be compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical
expression of surrounding structures. The directional expression of a landmark
after alteration, construction, or partial demolition should be compatible with
its original architectural style and character.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Architectural Details: Architectural details, including types of
materials, colors, and textures, should be treated so as to make the landmark
compatible with its original architectural style and character of a landmark or
of contributing structures within a designated district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â New Structures: New structures in a historic district shall be
compatible with the architectural styles and design in said district.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Issuance Of A Certificate Of Appropriateness: Upon approval of the
application, the commission shall direct the recording secretary to issue the
signed certificate of appropriateness to the applicant with copies forwarded to
the community development director, or their designee. A certificate of
appropriateness shall be invalid if changes in the plans reviewed by the
commission are necessary in obtaining a building permit or if the building
permit issued for the same work becomes invalid. The certificate of
appropriateness remains valid for the same period of validity as the building
permit.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Appeals: In the event of denial of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, the applicant may amend the application to accommodate
commission objections or request the application be forwarded to the city
council. Negative recommendations forwarded to city council require a four-
fifths (4/5) majority vote by council to overrule the commission. (Ord. 04-O-
51, 10-19-2004; amd. Ord. 06-O-48, 11-7-2006; Ord. 2025-O-5, 2-18-2025)

received, if any.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses for
the property.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Any other information, including income tax bracket of the owner,
applicant or principal investors in the property, reasonably necessary for a
determination as to whether the property can be reasonably used or yield a
reasonable return to present or future owners.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Delay Of Application: If the commission finds that without approval of
the proposed work, the property owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic
return therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for a period not to
exceed three (3) months. During this period of delay, the commission shall
investigate plans and make recommendations to the city council to allow for
reasonably beneficial use or a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise
preserve the subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include, but

issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work. If the
commission finds otherwise, it shall deny the application for a certificate of
economic hardship.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Appeals: When a certificate of economic hardship is approved or denied
for either a landmark or a structure within a historic district, the applicant
or any interested party may, within thirty (30) days, appeal the commissionâ€™s

of the record, but no new matter may be considered by the council. The council
may affirm the decision or recommend changes by a majority vote of the council
after due consideration of the facts contained in the record submitted to the
council by the commission. A four-fifths (4/5) majority is required to overturn
a negative recommendation of the commission. If the council decides that a
certificate of economic hardship should be issued, the secretary shall notify

seven (7) days of the councilâ€™s decision, and the community development
director, or their designee then shall issue the permit within fifteen (15)
days. If the council concurs with the commissionâ€™s decision not to issue a
certificate of economic hardship, the secretary shall notify the applicant and
the community development director, or their designee within seven (7) days.

9-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
9-11-3 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground including manufactured homes, prefabricated
buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days per year.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the community
development director, or their designee shall compare the elevation of the site
to the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown
by survey elevation to be below the base flood elevation. Any development
located on land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current
base flood elevation and which has not been filled after the date of the siteâ€™s
first flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not
subject to the requirements of this chapter. In addition, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected to a flood source, but not identified as floodplain on the current
flood insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.

9-11-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Charleston board of zoning
appeals and planning for a variance. The Charleston board of zoning appeals and
planning shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit
its recommendation to the Charleston city council. The Charleston city council
may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to
further the intent of this chapter.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain,
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted,
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The relief requested is the minimum necessary,
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or

pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Notification By Board: The Charleston board of zoning appeals and
planning shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the
requirements of the building protections standards of section
9-11-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Increase the risk to life and property; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Historic Structures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Variances to the building protection requirements of section
9-11-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
9-11-6 and
9-11-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate

capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
9-11-7 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
9-11-7B of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
9-11-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 11-O-28, 6-21-2011)
9-11-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Charleston or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 11-O-28, 6-21-2011)
9-11-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the community development
director, or their designee may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The community development director, or their
designee shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If such owner fails after ten (10) daysâ€™ notice to correct the
violation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The city of Charleston shall make application to the circuit court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter,
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense,

on which a violation occurs or continues, and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The city of Charleston shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee shall inform the
owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood
damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy
to be suspended.
The building code official is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the board of zoning appeals and planning. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of zoning appeals
and planning shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Charleston from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 11-O-28, 6-
21-2011; amd. Ord. 2025-O-5, 2-18-2025)
9-11-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city of
Charleston to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program
including: ordinance 89-O-29 dated November 21, 1989. However, this chapter
does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 11-O-28,

plans in conformance with subsection
10-4-2B4 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee, is
responsible for receiving and submitting a staff report relating to the
application for development approval prior to the formal recommendation or
decision, as applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Major subdivisions involve the division of a tract into 5 or more
parcels or more than 1 division of a tract of land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Minor subdivisions involve the division of a tract into 4 or fewer
parcels, or any subsequent division after 1 initial minor subdivision of a

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Application Process: The following procedures apply to all
applications, except as modified for specific procedures:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When Required: Unless indicated as optional, applicants shall meet
with the staff to discuss the nature of the proposed application, application
submittal requirements, the procedure for action and the standards for
evaluation of the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Application Requirements: Current application materials shall be
made available in the office of the community development director, or their
designee. Such applications shall be filed in advance of any public hearing or
public meetings required pursuant to this title. The community development
director, or their designee, may establish a schedule for filing any
application for development approval requiring action by the board of zoning
appeals and planning or the city council, which schedule shall provide adequate
time for notice and/or publication consistent with the Illinois Compiled
Statutes or otherwise applicable requirements. Completed applications shall be
filed and processed according to the schedule. At the preapplication
conference, the community development director, or their designee, may
determine that additional information is necessary to provide for an adequate
assessment of the project. At any time during the processing of any
application, additional information may be required by the decision maker to
respond to issues or concerns that may not have been evident at the
preapplication conference. The results of the preapplication conference,
prepared by staff, shall be made part of the development file upon submittal of
an application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Streamlining Development And Permitting Process: The community
development director, or their designee, and the public works director, as
applicable, shall be authorized to shorten the time required to process
applications for development, provided there is no conflict with statutory
requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Staff Review: The staff shall review the application and determine
if the application is complete. If the application is incomplete or submitted
prematurely, the community development director, or their designee, shall
return it to the applicant to be resubmitted in conformance with this title.
All applications shall be reviewed by city staff and other appropriate agencies
for compliance with city codes and policies. The staff may forward copies of
the applications to various agencies for their review of the material
submitted. Review agencies may request additional time for review, which may be
granted by the decision maker if good cause is shown and if such request is
made within the review time. The agenciesâ€™ review will be advisory and does not
constitute approval or denial. Upon completion of staff review, the staff will
provide its comments in writing to the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee, or Public
Works Director Decision: After the applicant has had the opportunity to respond
to the comments of staff and other agencies, the community development
director, or their designee, or the public works director, as applicable, shall
recommend approval or denial of the application based on the applicable review
criteria. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Appeals: Appeals to the community development director, or their
designeeâ€™s, or the public works directorâ€™s decision, as applicable, shall be

amended was served upon the party affected by the decision as defined in 735
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-103.

through the process it was originally approved.

expire within one year of issuance or approval; provided, that the decision
maker may approve an extension of up to twelve (12) months upon receipt of an
application providing evidence that the applicant can proceed with the initial
permit in conformance with currently adopted codes and policies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Enforcement And Revocation: The community development director, or
their designee, or the public works director, as applicable, may revoke any
permit for failure to comply with the conditions of the permit.

section), the applicant shall post city approved signs giving notice of the

shall make a recommendation to the city council. The city council may accept
the staff recommendation on a consent agenda or conduct a hearing on the staff
recommendation and then approve the application, approve the application with
conditions or deny the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Type 3: Type 3 applications shall be reviewed by staff, which
shall make a recommendation to the board of zoning appeals and planning. The
board shall conduct a public hearing as required, and make a recommendation to
the city council. The city council may approve the application, approve the
application with conditions or deny the application. The city council may add
or modify conditions of approval recommended by the board by a simple majority
vote, but a three-fourths (3/4) majority of the council is required to overturn
any recommendation made by the board.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Type 4: Type 4 applications shall be reviewed by staff, which
shall prepare findings of fact for review by the board of zoning appeals and
planning. The board shall conduct a public hearing on the application and
render a decision based on its own findings of fact from the application, staff
findings and testimony during the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Purpose Of Hearing: The purpose of a public hearing is to allow the
applicant and all other interested parties a reasonable and fair opportunity to
be heard, to present evidence relevant to the application, and to rebut
evidence presented by others.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Conduct Of Hearing: Public hearings shall be conducted in
conformance with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Applicant Not Present: If the applicant is not present at the public
hearing of the board of zoning appeals and planning, then the board may elect
to take no action on the application. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Record Of Proceedings: The proceedings of all public hearings shall
be recorded in conformance with the provisions of 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes
120/2.06. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. 2006 Code)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Continuance Of Proceedings:

and any stipulations or conditions placed upon the continuance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â If the board of zoning appeals and planning or city council,
continues a public hearing on its own motion, it may direct the community
development director, or their designee, to advertise the continuance of the
public hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â If the continuance of a public hearing is made at the request of
an applicant, the board of zoning appeals and planning or city council may
direct the applicant to advertise the continuance of the public hearing at the
applicant's expense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Where an applicant is required to advertise the continuance of
the public hearing, the applicant shall submit a certificate of publication to
the community development director, or their designee, indicating that such
publication has occurred.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Action On Applications Requiring Notice: The decision maker may take
any action on an application that is consistent with the notice given,
including approval of the application, conditional approval of the application
or denial of the application. The decision maker may allow amendments to the
application if the effect of the amendments is to reduce the density or
intensity of the original application, reduce the impact of the development, or
reduce the amount of land involved from that indicated in the notices of the
hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Notice Of Final Determination: Within ten (10) days of the final
determination on the development application, written notification of the

of an application for development. Minor revisions must be authorized in
writing by the community development director, or their designee, and are

accordance with the provisions of this section and other applicable sections of
this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Stay Of Action: An appeal or protest stays all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed unless the community development director,
or their designee, certifies to the decision maker, after notice of appeal has
been filed, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate, a stay

cause imminent peril to life or property.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Expiration Of Development Approval:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Time Of Expiration: Unless otherwise provided, development
applications shall automatically expire, and all activities pursuant to such

part of the original or revised approval of the development application, or
that was made pursuant to the terms of any development agreement, including the
failure to abide by specified time limits established therein; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The applicant fails to present a subsequent development
application as required by this title within the time required. If no time
limit for satisfaction of conditions is specified in the original or revised
approval of the development application, the time shall be presumed to be one
year from the date of approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Extension Procedures: Unless otherwise prohibited by this title, the
community development director, or their designee, may extend a staff issued
permit for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days from the

designee, or the public works director determines that there are reasonable
grounds for revocation of a development permit or approval, the community
development director, or their designee, or the public works director, as
applicable, shall set a hearing before the final decision maker. If the
original permit approval being revoked was made by the community development
director, or their designee, or the public works director, the hearing shall be
conducted by board of zoning appeals and planning. All other revocations shall
be reviewed by the city council. If the city council was the original decision
maker, the council may, at its sole discretion, refer the proposed revocation
to the board of zoning appeals and planning for a recommendation prior to its
action.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Notice And Public Hearing: Notice of the revocation hearing shall be
given in the same manner as required for the original application. A public
hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of subsection B of
this section.

decision maker shall render a decision to revoke the permit or allow the
applicant to retain the development permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Effect And Appeals: A decision to revoke a development permit shall
become final fifteen (15) days after the date the decision is rendered, unless
appealed. After the effective date of revocation, any activities continuing
pursuant to the permit shall be deemed to be in violation of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Right Cumulative: The city's right to revoke a development permit,
as provided in this section, shall be cumulative to any other remedy allowed by
law.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Transfer Of Land; Building Permit: No parcel of land in a subdivision
created after the adoption of this title shall be transferred, sold, or offered
for sale; nor shall a building permit, zoning permit or certificate of
occupancy be issued for any use or structure thereon, until a plat of
subdivision shall have been recorded with the recorder of deeds of Coles

provision shall be subject to the penalties expressed in chapter 3 of this
title.

appeals and planning or city council may initiate a request for any development
permit on behalf of the city. Such requests shall not be subject to fees, but

10-4-2: STAFF ISSUED PERMITS:
All staff issued permits follow the type 1 process described in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter; except, that site plans for development of
nonresidential lots or parcels encompassing one hundred thousand (100,000) or
more square feet of floor area in a single or multiple buildings shall be
reviewed by the board of zoning appeals and planning.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Zoning/Change Of Use Permit:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Ensure that the proposed change of use complies with the
provisions of this code, the comprehensive plan and other adopted plans;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Ensure that affected agencies may review the proposed change of
use; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Ensure compliance with applicable standards of the adopted
building and fire codes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: No land shall be occupied or used, and neither the
use of land nor the use of buildings thereon shall be changed, altered or
occupied, or used in whole or in part for any purpose, until a change of use
permit is issued by the community development director, or their designee. No
permit shall be issued to make a change unless the changes are in conformity
with the provisions of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application: Application shall be filed with the community
development director, or their designee, and shall be accompanied by a site
plan prepared pursuant to subsection B of this section and such other
information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be necessary to
determine and provide for the enforcement of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review Criteria: Applications shall be approved by the community
development director, or their designee, if:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The use or development is on a legally created lot or parcel;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The use is authorized in the existing zoning district; and

Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Site Plans:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: Site plan review ensures that proposed development complies
with this title. Site plan review shall consider the siting of proposed
construction and its impact on topography, vegetation, adjacent development,
improvements in the immediate area and the site plan's conformance to the
goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan and this title. The
design shall discourage unnecessary grading and shall retain the natural
character of the site including the preservation of trees and other natural
features to the degree practical.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A site plan shall be required for all new construction, exterior
additions or changes in use to any building, structure, land or parking lots.
No zoning permit or building permit shall be issued for a development subject
to site plan review until such site plan has been approved in accordance with
this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â When a conditional use permit application is reviewed, or when
the final plan for a planned unit development is reviewed, the site plan
application may be processed concurrently with those reviews.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee, may waive
the requirement for a site plan review for development within the scope of this
section when such a waiver will not adversely affect the purposes and intents
of this title, as evidenced by the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Changes to conforming development not resulting in an
increased parking demand or increased traffic generation; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Construction is limited to internal remodeling of a
nonresidential structure projected to cost less than fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) or changes are limited to internal remodeling of a residential
structure not creating additional bedrooms; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee, finds
that a site plan is not required to ensure compliance with adopted codes and
plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedure:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Site plans shall be reviewed and approved by the community
development director, or their designee; except, that site plans for
development of nonresidential lots or parcels encompassing one hundred thousand
(100,000) or more square feet of floor area in one or more buildings shall be
reviewed by the board of zoning appeals and planning as a type 4 process as
described in subsection
10-4-1 C1d of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A site plan, including all information listed in the appendix to
the ordinance codified herein, may be submitted for the entire development at
one time or for individual development phases. When a site plan is submitted
for an individual phase of a development on a single parcel, the applicant
shall also prepare a conceptual site plan for the remainder of the parcel. The
conceptual site plan shall indicate the approximate location of development on
the remainder of the parcel, together with proposed driveways, streets and

sections or phases of development. A PUD application includes a rezoning
application tied to a detailed plan for site development and a subdivision plat
if applicable. The concept plan phase of the PUD includes the site layout and
preliminary plat. The final plan is approved in conjunction with the rezoning,
proposed development phasing and final subdivision plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: Planned unit development may be applied to
residential, commercial, industrial and mixed use projects to provide design
flexibility not available through strict interpretation of the standards
established in this title. Classification as a planned unit development shall
require a rezoning of the affected property in conformance with subsection B of
this section. Design flexibility is provided through planned unit development
to enhance long term community benefits that may be achieved through high
quality development that provides:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â More efficient infrastructure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Reduced traffic demands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â More usable public or private open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Recreational amenities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Needed housing choices.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â PUD Concept Plan:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Purpose: A PUD concept plan constitutes a major step in the
review process and provides general information about the proposed planned unit
development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Applicability: A concept plan is optional, unless the applicant
proposes to develop a portion of a larger site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The applicant shall file an
application with the required information listed in the appendix to the
ordinance codified herein. PUD concept plan shall be processed as a type 3
application as described in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The concept plan application shall be evaluated
using the review criteria established for zoning map amendments (subsection B
of this section), major subdivision (subsection E of this section) and the
following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The development design is consistent with the purposes of the
planned unit development (subsection C1 of this section) and comprehensive plan
goals and policies; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The development is designed and phased to make efficient use
of existing infrastructure, have lower traffic volumes or contribute to better
mobility than would conventional development, provide more usable public or
private open space or other recreational amenities than conventional
development, and provide needed housing choices; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The development will provide long term benefits to the
neighborhood in which it is located and the community as a whole.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Decision Makers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Board Of Zoning Appeals And Planning: The board of zoning
appeals and planning shall review the concept plan application at a public
hearing and make a recommendation to the city council for approval, denial, or
conditional approval of the concept plan, the requested rezoning and the
preliminary subdivision plat, if applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â City Council: The city council shall review the concept plan
application, proposed zoning amendment, and the board of zoning appeals and
planning recommendation, and approve, deny, or conditionally approve the
concept plan and preliminary plat, if applicable. The city council may require
the dedication of perimeter rights of way as a condition of concept plan
approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Final Development Plan:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Purpose: The final development plan, together with the
development schedule and final plat, shall act as the blueprint for development
of a planned unit development project over the length of time the project is
developed. The final development plan and final plat refine the information
submitted during the concept plan stage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The applicant shall file an
application with the required information listed in the appendix to the
ordinance codified herein, and it shall be processed as a type 2 application in
accordance with subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The final development plan and final plat
application and submittal shall be in substantial conformance with the concept
plan. The final development plan shall be reviewed for substantial conformance
with the concept plan and the review criteria for rezoning (subsection B of
this section) and subdivision (subsection E of this section). Substantial
conformance means that the application does not:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vary the proposed gross residential density or intensity of
use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Vary the proposed ratio of residential units to
nonresidential square footage;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Involve a reduction of the area set aside for common open
space or the substantial relocation of such area;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Substantially increase the floor area proposed for
nonresidential use; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Substantially increase the total ground areas covered by
buildings or involve a substantial change in the height of buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Decision Makers: The city council shall review the final plan,
proposed zoning amendment and final plat, as applicable, within thirty (30)
days following the receipt of the complete application. The council shall
approve, conditionally approve or deny the final development plan, rezoning,
development schedule and final plat within thirty (30) days of its initial
consideration. The applicant shall provide all required subdivision guarantees
prior to the final reading of the ordinance creating the PUD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Recording: The final development plan and final plat with
restrictive covenants and articles of incorporation, if any, a certified copy
of the ordinance approving the plan and plat, and any other related documents
and changed zoning shall be recorded in the county recorder's office within six
(6) months of approval by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Amendments To Final Development Plan And Final Plat: No changes
shall be made in the approved final development plan and final plat unless in
conformance with the following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minor Changes: The community development director, or their
designee, may authorize minor changes under the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The term â€œminor changesâ€ as used in this section is
considered to represent changes which do not alter the overall characteristics
of the total plan and which create no adverse impacts on adjacent uses or
public services and facilities. Some examples of what can be considered as
minor changes are:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Changes in location and type of landscaping and/or screening so
long as the approved character and intent is maintained;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Changes in the orientation of portions of parking areas so long
as the effectiveness of the overall site circulation and parking is maintained;
parking areas shall be relocated not closer than twenty feet (20') to any
residential structure or ten feet (10') to any street or right of way lines;
and the number of parking spaces shall not be reduced by the relocation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â Changes in the location of sidewalks and pathways; provided,
that continuity of pedestrian circulation remains;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iv)Â Â Â The reorientation, but not complete relocation, of major
structures; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (v)Â Â Â Changes that will not impact properties or uses outside of and
adjacent to the PUD.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (vi)Â Â Â The construction of accessory buildings and structures as
established in this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â No minor change authorized by this section may cause any
of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Change in the permitted uses or of development
character;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Increased overall coverage of structures;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â Increased intensity of use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (iv)Â Â Â Increased demand for traffic circulation and public
utilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (v)Â Â Â Decrease in public or private open space;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (vi)Â Â Â Decrease in pavement and sidewalk widths; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (vii)Â Â Â Increased numbers of dwellings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Major Changes: All other changes to the approved final
development plan shall be deemed "major" and shall be approved only by the
council after review of a revised final development plan and/or map. No
amendments may be made in the approved final development plan unless the
applicant establishes that such amendments are required as a result of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Changes in conditions which occurred after final
development plan approval;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Changes in the development policy of the community; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Conditions that were reasonably unforeseen at the time of
final development plan approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Recording Of Changes And Amendments: Any changes that are
approved for the final development plan and/or final plat shall be recorded as
amendments to the previously recorded plan and/or map.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Lapse Of Plan And Rezone: If a PUD has not been completed in
accordance with an approved development schedule (a â€œlapseâ€), the community
development director, or their designee, shall schedule the project before the
board of zoning appeals and planning, at which time a revocation of all prior
approvals shall be considered. If the board of zoning appeals and planning
determines that a lapse has occurred, the community development director, or
their designee, shall record an appropriate legal notice and may initiate,
without owner consent, a zoning change to the underlying zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Development According To Final Development Plan And Final Plat: No
building permit shall be issued on any site unless a site plan has been
submitted and approved in accordance with the provision in subsection
10-4-2B of this chapter, and unless such site plan conforms with the conditions
of the adopted final plan and final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Transfer Of Ownership: The requirements, restrictions, conditions
and provisions of the approved PUD concept plan and final development plan and
final plat shall be binding upon the owners, their heirs and assigns and future
owners until such time as the city may release such limitation on the use of
the subject property under the procedures provided herein.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Conditional Use Permits: All conditional use permit applications follow
the type 3 review process as described in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of conditional use review is to allow the city
to exercise some discretion over the extent and design of certain activities
that could have a detrimental effect on the community if permitted to exist in
large numbers, in certain locations or without special conditions. Therefore,
these regulations enable the city to authorize a conditional use subject to
conditions that mitigate the potential problems associated with the use or its
location in relation to the neighboring properties. A conditional use is not a
use by right.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: Conditional uses, as shown in tables 5-2 and 5-3
(subsections
10-5-3B and C, respectively, of this title), are uses that have negative
impacts upon allowed uses that can be mitigated for some sites. A conditional
use, once approved, goes with the land for the approved use only, unless the
permit is revoked due to violations enumerated in subsection D6 of this
section. The designation of a use in a zoning district as a conditional use
does not constitute an authorization or assurance that such use will be
approved. Temporary uses for commercial, recreational or amusement land uses
also shall be required to receive approval of a conditional use permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The applicant shall file an application
with the required information listed in the appendix to the ordinance codified
herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The following criteria shall be used when
determining approval of a conditional use permit:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The proposed use at the specified location is consistent with the
goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The proposed use is consistent with the general purpose and
intent of the applicable zoning district regulations and complies with
requirements of this code;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed conditional use is not materially detrimental to the
public health, safety, comfort and general welfare, and will not result in
material damage or prejudice to other property in the vicinity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The proposed use is compatible with and preserves or enhances the
character and integrity of adjacent development and includes improvements
necessary to mitigate adverse development related impacts, such as traffic,
noise, odors, visual nuisances, or other similar adverse effects to adjacent
development and neighborhoods;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The proposed use does not generate pedestrian and vehicular
traffic that will be hazardous to the existing and anticipated traffic in the
neighborhood;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The proposed conditional use complies will all fire, health,
building, plumbing, electrical and storm water drainage regulations of the
city, county, state and federal agencies; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Adequate utilities exist to service the proposed conditional use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Decision Makers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Board Of Zoning Appeals And Planning: The board of zoning appeals
and planning shall conduct a public hearing, review the conditional use permit
application and make its recommendation to the council for approval, denial, or
conditional approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â City Council: The council shall review the conditional use permit
application and any other proposed action related to the permit and the board's
recommendation, and shall approve, conditionally approve or deny the permit.
The council may impose conditions and restrictions upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use as
deemed necessary to protect the public and to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Revocation: Any conditional use permit granted under the authority
of this title is subject to revocation by the council for any or all of the
following reasons:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Noncompliance with any special conditions imposed by this title
or by the council at the time of approval of the conditional use permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Violation of any provisions of this title pertaining to the use
of the land, construction or uses of buildings or structures or activities
conducted on the premises by the permittee or agents of the permittee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Violation of any other applicable provisions of this title or any
state or federal law or regulation by the permittee or agents of the permittee;
provided, that such violations relate to the conduct or activity authorized by
the conditional use permit or the qualifications of the permittee or its agents
to engage in such conduct or activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Validity: The conditional use permit shall be valid for the duration
of the period specified in the ordinance approving the permit unless revoked by
the council or the use is ceased or terminated for ninety (90) consecutive
days. The duration of the permit may be extended if, after a public hearing,
the board of zoning appeals and planning recommends and the council grants the
extension of up to one hundred twenty (120) days. Conditional use permits
granted prior to adoption of this title shall remain in effect under the
conditions established at the time the permits were issued. Amendments to those
permits shall be processed as new permits in accordance with this title. (Ord.
03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Major Subdivision: All subdivisions creating five (5) or more lots or
parcels (any of which is less than 5 acres) and any subdivision of a parcel
created through the minor subdivision process, shall be processed in
conformance with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8 and 765 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 205/0.01 et seq. (Ord. 09-O-60, 12-1-2009)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that
subdivisions comply with the minimum standards for the design, development and
improvement established in this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: Every owner of any tract or parcel of land who shall
hereafter subdivide or plat said tract or parcel into five (5) or more lots
(any of which is less than 5 acres) or shall divide a lot or parcel created
through the minor subdivision process shall follow the major subdivision
process.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Concept Plan:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of the concept plan is to ensure that
improvements are well coordinated within and among individually platted
parcels, sections, or phases of a development prior to approval of a
preliminary plat. Approval of a concept plan shall constitute approval of the
type(s) and intensity of development and approval of a project phasing plan. A
concept plan may be processed concurrently with a preliminary plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Applicability: A concept plan is required for any major
subdivision. The concept plan shall identify all contiguous land holdings of
the applicant and establish a phasing plan for any subdivision involving
multiple phases of development and any subdivision for which only a portion of
the parent tract or a portion of contiguous holdings under common ownership are
proposed to be platted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The applicant shall file an
application with the required information listed in the appendix to the
ordinance codified herein. The application shall be reviewed according to the
type 3 process described in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The board and council shall consider the
following criteria when reviewing the concept plan:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The consistency of the proposed subdivision with applicable
zoning of the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The consistency of proposed public improvements with the
existing and planned development within and surrounding the proposed
subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The suitability of the proposed project for the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Conformance of the proposed project with the goals and
objectives of the comprehensive plan and the city development standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The availability and adequacy of required public and
community facilities, utilities and services to serve the proposed project.
These may include, but are not limited to, sanitary and storm sewers, water,
electrical services, police and fire protection, schools, parks and recreation
facilities, roads, libraries, solid waste collection and disposal and others,
as applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The extent to which the proposed project would adversely
affect the capacity or safety of that portion of the street network influenced
by the use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â The extent to which the proposed project would contribute to
inefficient development patterns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â The environmental impacts that the proposed project will
generate including, but not limited to, excessive storm water runoff, water
pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, excessive nighttime lighting, or
other environmental harm.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Decision Makers: The city council shall determine whether the
proposed development meets the criteria stated in subsection E3d of this
section and shall approve, deny or conditionally approve the application after
receipt of the recommendation of the board. If the public works director
determines that the proposed subdivision may have a major impact on the school
districts, the city shall provide a copy of the concept plan and successive
preliminary plat to the applicable school district for review and comment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Effect Of Approval And Validity:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Approval of a concept plan constitutes acceptance of the
type, density and intensity of land use indicated on the plan as being
consistent with the comprehensive plan; the classification and arrangement of
streets indicated; the proposed phasing plan; and the nature of utility service
proposed. The approval of the concept plan shall not expire as long as the
development proceeds in accordance with the phasing plan. At such time as the
development lags one year behind the approved phasing plan, or a period of one
year elapses without approval of a preliminary plat, concept plan approval
shall expire. Upon receipt of a written request, the board of zoning appeals
and planning may approve extensions upon finding that changing conditions in
the city do not necessitate changes to the approved concept plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Concept plan approval does not ensure approval of a
preliminary plat involving a substantially different concept or failing to meet
specific requirements of these regulations, and approval does not comprise any
vesting of development rights or any assurance that permits of any kind will be
issued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Preliminary Plat:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Purpose: Preliminary plat approval allows the board of zoning
appeals and planning and city council to review all substantive aspects of a
proposed subdivision and impose such conditions as will be necessary to ensure
compliance with city plans and regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Applicability: Any person proposing to subdivide land, other than
a minor subdivision, shall submit the application and preliminary plat to the
community development director, or their designee, for consideration of the
board of zoning appeals and planning. The design and layout of the subdivision
shall conform to the requirements of chapter 8 of this title. The community
development director, or their designee, may permit the applicant to prepare a
final plat for submission to the council at the same time the preliminary plat
is submitted. However, if a concept plan is submitted concurrently with a
preliminary plat, the submission and review of the final plat shall be done
separately.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The applicant shall file an
application with the required information listed in the appendix to the
ordinance codified herein. The application shall be reviewed according to the
type 3 process described in subsection
10-4-1 C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Before any application is made, the applicant is encouraged
to confer with the community development director, or their designee, to
discuss, in general, the procedures and requirements for preliminary plat
approval pursuant to these regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A preliminary plat application and applicable fee shall be
submitted to the community development director, or their designee, for review
and the applicable fee shall be submitted to the city comptroller.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A preliminary plat application shall be filed thirty (30)
days prior to the regular board of zoning appeals and planning meeting at which
the applicant desires to be heard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Submittal Date: For purposes of these regulations, the date of
the regular meeting of the board of zoning appeals and planning at which time a
complete preliminary plat is reviewed shall constitute the official application
date of the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Notification Of Subdivision:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â School District: In conformance with 765 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 205/2, the community development director, or their designee, shall
notify the president of the school board of each school district in which the
land is subdivided that the plat has been submitted for approval and that it is
available for inspection. The notice shall give the date, time and place of
hearing on the plat and shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or shall be delivered by personal delivery.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â County: When a proposed subdivision is located within the
extraterritorial area of the city, outside the city limits, but not farther
than twelve (12) miles, the city shall provide a copy of the preliminary plat
to the county and applicable township for review and comments in conformance
with 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/2.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The recommending and decision making bodies
shall make the following findings before approving a preliminary plat:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The plat is consistent with the future land use map in
conformance with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The application conforms with environmental and health laws
and regulations concerning water and air pollution, the disposal of solid
waste, public facilities to supply water, community or public sewage disposal
and, where applicable, individual systems for sewage disposal. If on site
wastewater systems are proposed, the community development director, or their
designee, shall find that the proposed development and improvements are
compatible with long term expansion plans for the city wastewater system, and
the county health department shall certify that the proposed lots satisfy
applicable regulations prior to approval of the final plat;

the final plat to appropriate departments and agencies for their review and
shall forward all staff and agency comments to the applicant and city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The community development director, or their designee, shall
schedule review of the final plat with the city council within thirty (30) days
of filing of the final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Decision Makers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â City Council:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Unless agreed to by the applicant, the city council shall
approve, conditionally approve or deny the final plat within thirty (30) days
from the date of the application, and subsequently shall transmit written
notice of its decision to the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â If the proposed final plat is approved, the mayor shall

conformance with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-12-8.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Filing And Recordation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â After the approval of the final plat by the city council,
said plat and certified copy of the ordinance approving it shall be recorded in
the county recorder's office at the owner's expense. If not recorded within six
(6) months of approval, such plat shall have no validity and shall not be
recorded without reapproval in conformance with this subsection. The city
council may grant one 120-day extension to allow the plat to be recorded.
However, the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of
the six (6) months following approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The development improvement agreement, if applicable, shall
be recorded with the final plat.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Minor Subdivisions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: Adequate information concerning land use, utility
requirements, traffic impact, streets, easements and dedications, and
sufficient time to review that information are vital to ensure the continued
health, safety and welfare of the city residents. Recognizing that small scale
projects may be unnecessarily burdened by these process costs, the city herein
establishes a simplified procedure for minor subdivisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: Any person proposing to subdivide land into four (4)
or fewer lots or parcels shall submit a final plat to the community development
director, or their designee, prepared in accordance with subsection E of this
section. If public improvements are required, the applicant shall submit and
receive approval of construction plans prior to processing the final plat. If
any of the parcels in the proposed minor subdivision were created by the minor
subdivision process, or if the community development director, or their
designee, determines that the proposed subdivision creates the need for off
site infrastructure improvements, then the application shall be reviewed as a
major subdivision.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The application and procedure for minor
subdivisions shall be the same as for final plats (type 2 process); except,
that the community development director, or their designee, shall receive the
application and shall determine its completeness, and the final plat will not
be recorded until after all public improvements have been accepted by the city.
Applicants for subdivisions or resubdivisions may follow these procedures;
provided, that the subdivision meets all of the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â No new public streets are required for lot access to a public
street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â No new easements are required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The design and layout of the subdivision shall conform to the
requirements of chapters 8 and 9 of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The minor subdivision shall comply with the
criteria set forth for final plats.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Decision Makers: Consent of the city council shall be required for
approval of a minor subdivision.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Maintenance Guarantee: The applicant shall guarantee the public
improvements against defects in workmanship and materials for a period of two
(2) years from the date of city acceptance of such improvements. The
maintenance guarantee shall be secured in an amount reflecting twenty five
percent (25%) of the cost of the completed improvements at the time of adoption
of the resolution accepting the improvements.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Conveyances And Plat Adjustments Or Corrections:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose And Applicability: The following short form approval process
may be used for:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The conveyance of parcels of land or interests therein for use as
right of way for railroads or other public utility facilities and other
pipelines that do not involve any new streets or easements of access.

prior plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To add any course or distance that was omitted on the prior
plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â To correct an error in the description of the real property
shown on the prior plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â To indicate monuments set after death, disability or
retirement from practice of the engineer or surveyor charged with
responsibilities for setting monuments;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â To show the proper location or character of any monument
which has been changed in location or character or which originally was shown
at the wrong location or incorrectly as to its character on the prior plat;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â To correct any other type of scrivener or clerical error or
omission as previously approved by the board of zoning appeals and planning or
the city council; such errors and omissions may include, but are not limited
to: lot numbers, acreage, street names and identification of adjacent recorded
plats; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â To correct an error in courses and distances of lot lines
between two (2) adjacent lots where lot owners join in the application for plat
amendment and neither lot is abolished; provided, that such amendment does not
attempt to remove recorded covenants or restrictions and does not have a
material adverse effect on the property rights of the other owners in the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Single lot splits and lot line adjustment to combine lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The application, with the required
information as listed in the appendix to the ordinance codified herein, shall
be filed with the public works director who shall review the application
according to the type 2 process established in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter, and forward the plat for the review of affected
utilities and other applicable agencies. The public works director shall
approve, conditionally approve or deny approval of the application. However, if
a written protest to the application for correction to the plat is filed, then
the public works director shall schedule the application for review at the next
board of zoning appeals and planning meeting and shall notify all affected
property owners of such meeting. After approval of the application, all
conveyances or plat corrections or adjustments shall be recorded pursuant to
subsection E6f of this section. Disputed boundary line adjustments shall be
done in conformance with 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 215/0.01 et seq.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Review Criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â All resultant parcels shall comply with the minimum standards
required by these regulations;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â No change in street right of way locations or reduction of
easement width shall occur; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The action will not adversely affect the character of the
previously recorded plat or the character of the area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Decision Maker: The public works director shall approve,
conditionally approve or deny all applications for conveyance and plat
corrections or adjustments.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Vacation Or Abandonment Of Streets, Easements Or Plats:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: When deemed to be in the public interest, and where no
private rights will be injured or endangered and neither the public nor
abutting property owners will suffer any loss or inconvenience thereby, all or
a portion of any street, alley or public reservation, including, but not
limited to, public utility or drainage easements, dedicated building setback
lines and access control, or subdivision plat may be vacated, in conformance
with 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5 and 765 Illinois Compiled Statutes 205/
6 and 205/7. Applications for vacation of any street, alley or a public
reservation or subdivision plat may be made by the city or by any owner of
property on which the street, alley or public reservation lies or adjoins.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: A street or easement may be vacated if the street,
alley or public reservation, or easement is not necessary for the public safety
or convenience and meets the review criteria set forth below. A plat may be
vacated or abandoned if it has not been developed or has been partially
developed and the owner desires to vacate the undeveloped portion thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: Any street, alley or public reservation,
or portion thereof, certain public roads, or subdivision plat may be vacated by
ordinance adopted by the city council pursuant to the type 2 process
established in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter. Any application for vacation or abandonment by
ordinance shall be filed in the office of the public works director with the
required information as listed in the appendix to the ordinance codified
herein. Following the adoption of any ordinance vacating any street, alley or
public reservation, or portion thereof, or subdivision plat, the clerk shall
file a copy thereof for recording. Any vacation of right of way, reservation or
easement on a recorded plat shall be noted on the final plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Reservation Of Easements: In vacating any street, alley or public
reservation, or portion thereof, either by plat or by ordinance, the council
may reserve such rights of way and other easements as in the judgment of the
council are necessary or desirable for public service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Reversion Of Land Vacated: Streets, alleys or other public
reservations that have been vacated shall be sold or shall revert to the owners
of adjoining properties as provided by state law and any amendments thereto.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Review Criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The proposal is in conformance with 765 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 205/6;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The proposal is consistent with the comprehensive plan, major
street plan and other adopted plans and policies of the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposal shall not landlock any parcel of land;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The proposal shall not restrict access to any parcel so that such
access is unreasonable, economically prohibitive, or devalues any property
affected by the proposed vacation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â The proposal shall have no adverse impact on the health, safety,
and/or welfare of the general community, and shall not reduce the quality of
public services provided to any parcel of land; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â There is evidence that the right of way, reservation or easement
or subdivision plat is no longer needed by any of the parties having an
interest in same.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Decision Makers: The city council shall review the application in
the same manner as a final plat at a public hearing and approve, approve with
conditions or deny approval of the application.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Improvement Agreements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of an improvement agreement is to ensure
completion of public improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: Except as provided below, before the final plat is
recorded, all applicants shall be required to complete, to the satisfaction of
the public works director, all street, sanitary, and other public improvements,
as well as lot improvements on the individual residential lots of the
subdivision or addition as required by these regulations. The required
improvements shall be those specified in the approved preliminary and/or final
plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Conditions: As a condition of final plat approval, the council shall
require the applicant to execute an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of
the city of Charleston to assure the construction of certain infrastructure
extensions and improvements as identified in the final plat and the improvement
agreement. This surety shall remain in effect for the duration of the agreement
or until the city has accepted all improvements. In the event the applicant is
unable to complete the required improvements, and such improvements are deemed
necessary for the preservation of the public health and safety, the city may
use the letter of credit or other guarantee to complete the improvements as
required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Guarantee Of Completion Of Improvements: The council may defer the
requirement for the completion of required improvements if the applicant enters
into an improvement agreement by which the applicant covenants and agrees to
complete all required public improvements no later than two (2) years following
the date upon which the final plat is signed. Such two (2) year period may be
extended for up to an additional two (2) years at the discretion of the
council. The council may require the applicant to complete and dedicate some
required public improvements prior to approval of the final plat and to enter
into an improvement agreement for completion of the remainder of the required
improvements during such two (2) year period. The city attorney shall approve
any improvement agreement as to form and legality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Covenants To Run With Land: The improvement agreement shall provide
that the covenants contained therein shall run with the land and bind all
successors, heirs and assigns of the applicant. The improvement agreement shall
be recorded with the county recorder. All existing lien holders shall be
required to subordinate their liens to the covenants contained in the
improvement agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Performance Security:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Whenever the council permits an applicant to enter into an
improvement agreement, the applicant shall be required to provide sufficient
security to ensure completion of the required public improvements. The security
shall be in the form of a letter of credit, cash escrow or a surety bond naming
the city as the "beneficiary".
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The letter of credit, cash escrow or surety bond shall be in an
amount estimated by the public works director as reflecting one hundred percent
(100%) of the cost of the improvements in the approved construction plan as
calculated using prevailing wage rates, and shall be sufficient to cover all
promises and conditions contained in the improvement agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â In addition to all other security, when the city participates in
the cost of an improvement, the applicant shall provide a performance bond from
the contractor, with the city as a co- obligee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The issuer of any surety bond shall be subject to the approval of
the city attorney.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Escrow Agent: If security is provided in the form of a cash escrow,
the applicant shall deposit said security with the city clerk a cash amount or
certified check endorsed to the escrow agent for a face value in an amount not
less than the amount specified by the public works director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Accrual: The surety bond or cash escrow account shall accrue to
the city for administering the construction, operation and maintenance of the
improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Reimbursement: Where oversized facilities are required by the
city, the city and applicant shall specify a reimbursement procedure in the
improvement agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Maintenance Guarantee: The applicant shall guarantee the
improvements against defects in workmanship and materials for a period of two
(2) years from the date of city acceptance of such improvements. The
maintenance guarantee shall be secured in an amount reflecting twenty five
percent (25%) of the cost of the completed improvements at the time of adoption
of the resolution accepting the improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Temporary Improvements: The applicant shall construct and pay for
all costs of temporary improvements required by the city and shall maintain
said temporary improvements for the period specified.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Governmental Units: Governmental units to which these improvement
and security provisions apply may file, in lieu of the agreement and security,
an ordinance by the officers or officials authorized to act on their behalf,
agreeing to comply fully with all applicable provisions of these regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 11.Â Â Â Decision Makers: The city council shall approve, approve with
conditions or deny approval of the improvement agreement.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â Variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: Variances provide a mechanism for relief for property
owners when strict application of this title would result in practical
difficulties or a particular hardship. The variance granted shall be the
minimum necessary to permit reasonable use of the land.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: The board of zoning appeals and planning shall hear
and make recommendations on all requests for variances, in conformance with 65
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-5. The city council shall decide all
variances. No variance shall be granted to allow a use that is not authorized
by this title or a density that exceeds the maximums established for the
applicable zoning district. The practical difficulty or hardship must be
clearly exhibited and shall not be a result of actions of the applicant or
previous owner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The application, with the required
information as listed in the appendix to the ordinance codified herein, shall
be filed with the community development director, or their designee, and
processed in accordance with the procedures for a type 3 application as
described in subsectionÂ 
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Required Findings: A variance is not a right. In conformance with 65
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-5, a variance may be granted only upon
finding that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the zone; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The following factors shall be used to determine whether each of
the findings have been satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Prior to finding that a property could not yield a reasonable
return as provided in subsection J4a of this section, the city shall consider:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The initial purchase price was prudent and the intended
return reasonable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Lack of reasonable return was not due to a general
economic downturn that affected all similarly situated property in the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The impact of the regulations could not have been
reasonably anticipated at the time of purchase of the property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prior to finding that the plight of the owner is due to
unique circumstances, as provided in subsection J4b of this section, the city
shall consider:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The variance is being requested due to a constraint that
does not commonly apply to other properties within the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The variance is required due to the shape or size of the
property or due to natural constraints such as steep slopes, floodplains or
significant vegetation (define this as specimen trees or stands of trees) that
will be preserved.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Prior to finding that the variance, if granted, will not
alter the essential character of the locality, as provided in subsection J4c of
this section, the city shall consider:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The variance will not reduce the viability of adjacent
uses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The variance will not reduce the value of adjacent
properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The variance will not create a health or safety hazard for
the users of the subject or adjacent properties, pedestrians, bicyclists or
automobiles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The variance will not subject adjacent residences to
additional light or noise.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Decision Makers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Board Of Zoning Appeals And Planning: The board of zoning appeals
and planning shall conduct a public hearing in conformance with subsection
10-4-1B of this chapter. The board shall make recommendation to the city
council on approval or denial of the variance request. The board shall make
finding based upon subsection J4 of this section in conformance with 65
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-5.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â City Council: City council shall make the final decision by
considering the above described findings and minutes of the public hearing from
the board of zoning appeals and planning.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Adjustments By Board Of Zoning Appeals And Planning: After making
required findings the board may grant design authorized adjustments for the
redevelopment, remodeling or expansion of existing sites when it determines
that the strict application of landscaping and other standards cannot be
accomplished on the site. These provisions shall not apply to redevelopment of
sites involving the removal of existing buildings.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Required Findings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The applicant has provided sufficient information to evaluate the
necessity of the exception and the impacts of the proposed design alternative;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Strict compliance with landscaping standards is not physically
feasible, due to existing structures on the site, required parking and required
setbacks; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The proposed exceptions are the minimum required to allow the
proposed redevelopment, remodeling or expansion of the site; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The proposed design alternative and exceptions result in greater
compliance with the landscape provisions, a more attractive site and greater
compatibility with adjacent development than current development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Authorized Exceptions: The board may adjust landscaping, parking and
setback requirements subject to the following limitations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Total site landscaping has not been reduced more than twenty
percent (20%) below the requirement for new development on the site;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Total number of parking spaces has not been reduced by more than
ten percent (10%) of the required spaces; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Parking angles, parking space width and traffic flow are
sufficient to provide for the safe reduction of parking aisle widths; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Building setbacks have not been reduced by more than twenty
percent (20%).
Â Â Â L.Â Â Â Appeals From Staff Determinations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: Appeals to the board of zoning appeals and planning provide
a mechanism for review of any staff determination, including, but not limited
to, action on a development application or interpretation of development
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: An applicant, aggrieved citizen or city
representative, who believes that the city has committed an error in any order,
requirement, decision or refusal made by any member of the city staff, may
appeal that action by filing a notice of appeal with the community development
director, or their designee, within thirty (30) days of the subject action. An
appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless
in the opinion of the community development director, or their designee, by
reason of the facts stated, the request or stay would result in imminent peril
to life or property. In this event, the proceedings shall not be stayed except
by order of the board or by the circuit court on application and on notice to
the community development director, or their designee, from whom the appeal is
taken, and on due cause shown. The board may authorize development activity to
continue if it determines that the development does not pose an imminent threat
to the health, safety and welfare of adjacent property owners.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The application shall be the same as
those required for a variance and shall be processed in accordance with the
procedures for a type 4 application as described in section
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Appeals Review Criteria: The scope of review shall be limited to
determining whether the decision or interpretation by the staff was in
accordance with the intent and requirements of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Decisions: The procedures shall be in conformance with 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/11-13-12.
Â Â Â M.Â Â Â Vested Rights Determination:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Purpose: The vested rights determination procedure is intended to
determine whether an applicant has acquired a protected status that requires
the city to permit a development to proceed contrary to existing or amended
land use regulations. The procedure establishes a limit on the duration of all
development approvals to avoid unproductive investment in public facility
system capacities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Applicability: The determination of vested rights applies to
developments and permits that were approved or issued or were in the process of
being approved on or before the effective date hereof and approved projects in
which no development activity has occurred for five (5) years or more.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Application And Procedures: The application for vested rights
determination shall include all information listed in the appendix to the
ordinance codified herein and shall be processed as a type 3 application
pursuant to subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Review Criteria: The application shall be denied unless the
applicant demonstrates compliance with the following criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Entitlement to development approval on the basis of detrimental
reliance, i.e.:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The initial application for development approval was made by
the applicant and approved by the city;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The city had an opportunity to require the applicant to
submit relevant information, including, but not limited to, adequate public
facilities data;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The applicant has proceeded in good faith; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No approvals or permits have lapsed or been revoked; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Entitlement to development approval on the basis of other vested
rights under any applicable state law.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Decision Makers:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Board Of Zoning Appeals And Planning: The board of zoning appeals
and planning shall review the application at a public hearing in conformance
with subsection
10-4-1B of this chapter and shall make recommendations to the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â City Council: The city council shall approve, conditionally
approve or deny approval of all vested rights determinations. If the applicant
is found to be vested, the city council shall enter into an agreement with the
applicant specifying the terms of continued development. If the applicant is
found to be not vested, the development application for which the applicant
made the vested rights claim shall be considered void.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Validity: The vested rights determination shall be valid for one
year if the applicant fails to enter into an improvements agreement. Otherwise,
vested rights determination shall be valid for the term specified in the
development agreement.
Â Â Â N.Â Â Â Issuance Of Rules And Regulations For Public Improvements: The city may
promulgate reasonable rules and regulations regarding the design and
installation of improvements required pursuant to this title through a type 2
review process as described in subsection
10-4-1C of this chapter. The public works director shall prepare such rules for
review and approval by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Minimum Standard: Any rule and regulation established shall meet the
minimum city and state standards, but nothing in this section shall prevent the
city from requiring compliance with higher requirements than the state
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Notice Of Hearing: Notice of public hearing on any proposed rule or
regulation shall be given in at least one newspaper having general circulation
within the city at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â When Effective: Rules and regulations issued by the city shall be
effective after approval by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Enforcement Of Rules: The public works director shall enforce rules
and regulations adopted under this section in the following manner:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Suspend Or Revoke Permit: The public works director may suspend
or revoke any permit for noncompliance with any rule or regulation issued
pursuant to this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Notice Of Violation: When the public works director determines a
violation exists, the public works director shall notify the violator in
writing. Such notice of violation shall be delivered to the person causing the
violation or the legally authorized representative of the person or mailed to
the last known address of that person.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Stop Work Order Issued: In addition to the notice of violation,
the public works director may issue a written stop work order if it is believed
that the violation poses a serious threat to health and safety. The stop work
order shall be delivered to the owner of the property involved, to the agent of
the owner or to the person doing the work.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Reinstallation Of Improvement: The public works director may
require that an improvement installed in violation of rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to this section be reinstalled in compliance with adopted
rules and regulations. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. Ord. 03-O-38, 12-16-2003;

that the official zoning map becomes damaged or destroyed, or for purposes of
clarity due to a number of boundary changes, or to correct drafting errors or
omissions; provided, however, that any such adoption shall not have the effect
of amending the original unified development code or any subsequent amendment
thereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Airport Overlay Map: The boundaries of the airport overlay district
shall be the same as shown on the airport height zoning map. This map is hereby
adopted by reference as the official airport overlay map. The map shall have
the same force and effect as if it were fully set forth and described herein.
The map is available for review in the office of the Community Development
Department.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â University Influence Area: The boundaries of the university

Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Interpretation Of Zoning Map:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, alleys or other public rights of way shall be construed to
follow the centerlines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following the lot lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following section lines,
quarter lines, quarter section lines, or quarter-quarter section lines shall be
construed as following the lines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following corporate limits
shall be construed as following corporate limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed
to be midway between the main tracks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
rivers, streams, creeks or other waterways shall be construed to follow the
centerlines.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Boundaries not capable of being determined in subsections C1 through
C6 of this section shall be as dimensioned on the official zoning map or if not
dimensioned, shall be determined by the scale shown on the map.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Â Â Â Relationship Between Zoning Districts And Future Land Use
Categories: The adopted future land use classification map shall guide
determination of appropriate zoning. Table 5-1 below shows the correlation
between future land use categories and zoning districts. Where multiple
districts may apply to a future land use category, appropriate zoning shall be
based on compatibility with existing and planned land uses and public
facilities. The planned unit development (PUD) district is the appropriate
district for mixed use development. The PUD district, the airport overlay
district and the university influence area may be applicable to any future land
use category. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)

director, or their designee. The master signage plan shall contain the
following information:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An accurate plot plan of the zoning lot, at a specified
scale.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The location of all buildings, parking, driveways and
landscaped areas on the zoning lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum
area for each individual sign, the height of each individual sign and the total
number of signs to be erected on the zoning lot.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â An accurate indication on the plan of the proposed location
of each present and future sign, except temporary signs need not be shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Maximum Sign Area:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Maximum Total Sign Area: The maximum total sign area for all
signs on a zoning lot in the C/D district, except incidental signs, building
markers and temporary signs, shall not exceed the lesser of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Maximum number of total square feet: Five hundred (500).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Square feet of signage per linear foot of street frontage:
One (1.0).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Lots Fronting On Two Or More Streets: Lots fronting on two
(2) or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street
frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular
street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocations that
is derived from the lot, building or wall area frontage on that street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Computation Of Area Of Individual Signs: The area of a sign
face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one
face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence
or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of this title
and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Computation Of Area Of Multi-Faced Signs: The sign area for a
sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of
all sign faces visible from any one point. When two (2) identical sign faces
are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at
the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and
are not more than forty two inches (42") apart, the sign area shall be computed
by the measurement of one of the faces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Computation Of Height: The height of a sign shall be computed
as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be
the lower of: a) existing grade prior to construction; or b) the newly
established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,
mounding or excavating, solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases
in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be
computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base
of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a
public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Permitted Signs: The following signs are permitted in the C/

trunk size of two and one-half inches (21/2") in diameter upon installation, as
measured six inches (6") above the established ground level.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Plant material should be placed intermittently against long
expanses of building walls, fences and other barriers to minimize the stark
appearance and create a softening effect.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Planting beds should be mulched with bark chips, feather
rocks or similar materials. Mulch shall not be used as a substitute for plant

yards shall consist of a combination of ground cover, shade trees, ornamental
trees and shrubs, decorative paving material and appropriate screening devices
such as decorative walls or berms. The use of shade trees and ornamental trees
shall be provided at the rate of one tree for every fifty (50) linear feet of
landscaped open space. Evergreen trees may be substituted for shade trees or
ornamental trees upon approval of the community development director, or their
designee. Ornamental shrubs shall be provided at a rate of one shrub for every
fifty (50) linear feet of landscaped open space and, except as otherwise
required, shall be maintained at a height of not more than four feet (4'). A

density and dimensional standards of the underlying district established in
table 8-1 (subsection
10-8-1C of this title), except as expressly approved in the PUD plan. Densities
greater than those designated in the adopted future land use plan shall be
based on the compatibility of the proposed development with adjacent uses, the
adequacy of facilities and services and the amenities provided for users of the
development. The intensity of nonresidential development shall be established
as a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) at the time of planned development
approval. In determining the maximum FAR, the board of zoning appeals and
planning and city council shall consider:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The intensity of adjacent development;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Demands for the nonresidential development proposed in the PUD;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The mix of residential and nonresidential development in the

established in this title. The following additional performance standards are
applicable to the PUD district:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Dimensional Standards: All dimensional standards established in
chapter 8 of this title shall apply to development within the planned
development unless the city council finds that potential negative impacts of
proposed exceptions to minimum standards are fully mitigated and are offset by
community amenities provided in the development. Furthermore, the applicant
must meet the following standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Setback Standards: Building setbacks shall not be less than the
minimum setback standards established in chapter 8 of this title for the
underlying district unless the applicant can demonstrate that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Buildings can be designed safely and compatibly with lesser
setbacks;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Reduced setbacks are offset by the provision of readily
accessible private or common open space;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Modified setbacks provide for the protection of steep
hillsides, wetlands or other environmentally sensitive natural features; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â All buildings are provided with adequate emergency access for
fire protection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Architectural Standards: The architecture of the nonresidential
construction shall be compatible with the adjacent residential development.
Residential development restrictions may be required as part of the development
approval process.

recreation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Open space or agricultural land reservation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Community facilities for provision of public services beyond
those required for development within the PUD; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Other provisions in excess of minimum standards that the board
and the city council find provide sufficient community benefit to offset the
proposed deviation from strict development standards. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)

Within Charleston there exist structures, uses of structures and uses of land
that were lawful prior to the effective date hereof, but which now would be
prohibited or restricted under the provisions of this title. The purpose and
intent of this title is to permit these nonconformities to continue until they
are removed, but not to encourage their continuation. Such uses are declared by
this title to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved.
Such nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, except
in conformance with section
10-6-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-6-2: CONTINUATION, COMPLETION OF NONCONFORMING PROJECTS:
Whenever the use of a building shall become nonconforming through an amendment
to this title or the district boundaries, such use may be continued and, if no
structural alterations are made, may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a more restricted classification. No accessory use or building
shall be added to a nonconforming lot or lot containing a nonconforming
building or structure. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)

this title. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. Ord. 2025-O-5, 2-18-2025)
10-6-4: EXPANSION, IMPROVEMENT, RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE OF NONCONFORMITY:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Expansion: A nonconforming use of land existing on the effective date
hereof may be continued; provided, however, that no such nonconforming use of
land shall, in any way, be expanded or extended, either on the same or
adjoining property, except for construction that is intended to bring the
property into compliance with the Americans with disabilities act requirements.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Improvement, Repair And Maintenance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Routine Repair And Maintenance Of Nonconforming Structure: Normal
maintenance or minor repair of a nonconforming structure shall be permitted.
Nonstructural repairs include roof replacement, foundation tuck pointing,
window replacement, painting, replacement of trim and siding, and other normal

the fair market value of the property prior to conducting of the maintenance,
based on an appraisal prepared by a state of Illinois certified real property
appraiser. If the value of repairs exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the fair
market value of the property, the building or structure shall be brought into
conformance with the provisions of this title. Value of repairs shall be
determined based on material costs and prevailing wage rates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Remodeling And Alterations Of Nonconforming Use:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â If remodeling costs exceed the lesser of one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) or sixty percent (60%) of the fair market value of a
property, based on an appraisal performed by a certified real property
appraiser, in any continuous thirty six (36) month period, the property shall
be brought into conformance with this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Structural alterations or additions to a building that is
nonconforming with respect to the height and/or setback requirements
established in section
10-8-1 of this title shall be permitted; provided, that no such alteration or
addition shall increase the existing nonconformity or create a new
nonconformity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Restoration Of Destroyed Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming building
that has been damaged by fire, explosion, or act of God to the extent of more
than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value shall not be restored except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When
damaged by less than fifty percent (50%) of its reproduction value, a
nonconforming building may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the
time of damage; provided, that all portions of the structure being restored are
not and were not on or over the property line, the nonconformity is not
increased, and a certificate of occupancy is issued within one year of the date
of the damage. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-6-5: CERTIFICATE OF NONCONFORMITY:
Evidence of the status of a nonconforming structure, use of land or use in a
structure shall be supplied by the owner of the property upon request of the
community development director, or their designee. Any nonconforming use that
has not been issued a certificate of nonconformity within twelve (12) months of
notification by the city shall lose its status as a legal nonconforming use and
shall be discontinued.
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Proof Of Status: One or more pieces of evidence predating the effective
date hereof shall be provided by the applicant and included with the
application. Evidence of nonconformity shall be in the form of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Building, land use or development permits;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â City or state zoning, tax assessor or aerial maps;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Repair and maintenance bills and receipts giving proof of the
nonconformity's existence;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Remodeling, mechanical and electrical equipment contractors'
receipts for installation and construction affecting the nonconformity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Bills of sale and contracts;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Business licenses;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Listing in telephone or business or similar publications; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Any other evidence that the community development director, or their
designee, deems appropriate to the nonconforming structure, land use or use in
a structure.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Review Of Information; Issuance Or Denial Of Certificate: The community
development director, or their designee, shall review the applicantâ€™s evidence
of preexisting, nonconforming status and determine if the nonconforming
situation is valid. When such a determination is made, the community
development director, or their designee, shall issue a certificate of
nonconformity to the applicant verifying the nature of the nonconformity, date
upon which the nonconformity occurred, the duration of the nonconformity and
the legal description of the nonconforming property. An official copy of the
certificate of nonconformity shall be retained by the city clerk. If the
community development director, or their designee, determines that the evidence
is insufficient or unsatisfactory, the applicant may appeal the community
development directorâ€™s, or their designeeâ€™s, determination to the board of
zoning appeals and planning pursuant to subsection
10-4-3 L of this title. In addition, a certificate of nonconformity shall be
required for all lawful nonconforming uses of land or buildings created by the
adoption of this title. The application for the certificate of nonconformity
shall be filed with the community development director, or their designee,
within one year after notification by the city of the nonconformity. The
applicant shall apply for a change in use permit if there is a change from one
use to another, in conformance with section
10-6-6  of this chapter. The city shall record the notice of nonconformity and
subsequent certification. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. Ord. 2025-O-5, 2-18-
2025)
10-6-6: CHANGE IN USE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Change In Use Authorized:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Any nonconforming use of land or structure may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same nature or to a less intensive nature if no
structural alterations are involved and if it is found that the relation of the
structure and proposed use to surrounding property is such that adverse effects
on occupants and neighboring property will not be greater than if the original
nonconforming use continued.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those
parts that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use on the effective
date hereof.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Information Required: Approval for such a change shall be processed
through the board of zoning appeals and planning at a public hearing. The
following additional factors shall be reviewed:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The character and history of the use and of development in the
surrounding area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The comparable degree of noise, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, glare
or smoke detectable at the property line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The comparative numbers and kinds of vehicular trips to the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The comparative amount and nature of outside storage, loading and
parking.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The comparative visual appearance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â The comparative hours of operation.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The comparative effect on water drainage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Other factors which tend to reduce conflicts of incompatibility with
the character or needs of the area.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Application Required: Application for the change of a nonconforming use
shall be submitted to the community development director, or their designee, in
conformance with the requirements of subsection
10-4-2 A of this title, in writing, together with a site plan showing the
existing uses, detailing the type and amount of the proposed change and the
names and addresses of all adjacent property owners within two hundred fifty
feet (250') of the property.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notice Of Change Of Use And Protest: Upon receipt of the application,
the property shall be posted with notification of the proposed change. If
protests are received from thirty five percent (35%) or more of the property
owners within the two hundred fifty foot (250') limit within fifteen (15) days
of the posting, the requested change shall require a conditional use permit
(see subsection
10-4-3D of this title).
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Recommendation And Action: The board shall make its recommendations on
the conditional use permit in writing to the city council. The council shall
approve, conditionally approve or deny the application as provided in
subsection
10-4-3D of this title.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Review Criteria: In addition to the criteria established in subsection
10-4-3D of this title, the board and council shall use the following criteria
to make their determinations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The proposed use creates no more off site problems than the existing
use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The proposed use occupies no more area of the structure than the
existing use;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The proposed use requires no more off street parking than the
existing use; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Existing lawful nonconforming uses of a structure that change owners
but continue the same use shall be permitted to do so; provided, that an
agreement is signed by the new owner and kept on file in the city clerkâ€™s
office stating that the new owner agrees to all conditions placed on the
previous owner and use(s) of the structure. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. Ord.
2025-O-5, 2-18-2025)
10-6-7: NONCONFORMING PARKING:
The maintenance, repair and alterations of a use with nonconforming parking may
be permitted, provided the activity does not increase the need for off street
parking. Where these activities result in an increase in parking demands,
sufficient off street parking shall be provided to bring the entire development
into conformance with the requirements of this title. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-6-8: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:

Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Generally: Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or portion
thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, any future
use of such building or portion thereof shall be in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which such building is located. Evidence of
abandonment of the nonconforming use is not required. The board may grant an
extension when an applicant provides evidence of the intent to continue a
nonconforming use and has demonstrated that such extension will not threaten
the health, safety or welfare of adjacent property owners.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Intermittent, Illegal Uses: The casual, intermittent, temporary or
illegal use of a structure, land or structure and land in combination shall not
be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use, and the
existence of a nonconforming use on part of a lot or tract shall not be
considered to have established a nonconforming use on the entire lot or tract.
(Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Removal Of Nonconforming Mobile Home Or Manufactured Home: A
nonconforming mobile home or manufactured home not located in a mobile home
park, having been removed from its foundation or pad, shall constitute
abandonment of the use and shall comply with the provisions of this title.

requirements of the zoning district in which they are located.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Historic Structures: All structures listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, or as a state or local historical site, shall not be required
to be brought into conformity with this title; provided, that no construction
or reconstruction increases the degree of nonconformity of the structure or
threatens the historic status of the structure. Structures and locations that
are eligible for listing on the national register shall be exempt from this
title, provided an application for designation by the U.S. interior department
on the national register is filed and accepted.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Development Of Legal Lots Of Record Not In Compliance With Bulk/Density
Standards: In order to encourage infill and redevelopment, legal lots of record
and vested lots of record that do not meet the bulk and density requirements of
this title may be developed with the land uses permitted in the district.
However, the city council may require that adjacent lots under single ownership
be consolidated to achieve planned density. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-6-11: CONVERSION TO CONDITIONAL USE:
Any nonconforming building, structure, or use may be converted to a permitted
conditional use by the granting of a conditional use permit in conformance with
subsection
10-4-3D of this title. This may occur only when it is shown that the

shall be issued for a lot that fails to meet minimum lot requirements, except
in the following cases:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Utilities using land or an unoccupied building covering less
than one thousand (1,000) square feet of site area are exempt from minimum lot
area standards (i.e., sewer lift station, telecommunications buildings).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The minimum lot area standards of this title shall not
prohibit the construction of a detached dwelling unit on a vacant lot that was
legally platted or recorded before the effective date hereof; provided, that
the dwelling unit is constructed in compliance with all other applicable
dimensional standards and meets the minimum health and safety standards for
water and wastewater facilities and private sewage disposal systems.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Lot Width: Lot width is measured between side lot lines along a line
that is parallel to the front lot line or its chord. Minimum lot width is
measured at all points between the front and rear setback for irregularly
shaped lots along curves or cul-de- sac streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Street Frontage: Street frontage is measured between side lot lines
along the front lot line.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Setbacks:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Measurement: Setbacks are measured between the furthermost
projection of a structure and the nearest property line of the lot on which the
structure is located. Setbacks must be unobstructed from the ground to the sky
except as specified in this section. The setback of the building from front,
side and rear lot lines shall be measured at right angles from the lot line to
the nearest point of the adjacent building wall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Bulk Plane: For any building on a lot or parcel abutting a
single-family residence in an A, RE, R-1 or R-2 district, the building setbacks
must be increased by at least one foot (1') for each foot of height in excess
of thirty feet (30'). (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Side Streets: Except in the C-3 district, on side streets,
buildings must be set back at least twenty five feet (25') or the average
setback, as described in subsection B5e of this section, whichever is less.
Buildings on side streets in the R-3, R-3U, R-4 and R-4U districts must be set
back at least fifteen feet (15') or the average setback, as described in
subsection B5e of this section, whichever is less. (Ord. 08-O-28, 10-7-2008)

10-8-3: CLUSTER OR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of clustering lots or buildings in a development
is to preserve environmentally sensitive areas, open space and agricultural
lands. Clustered development patterns shall be permitted according to the
provisions of this section.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Clustering Of Single-Family Residential Dwellings Permitted: In any
single-family subdivision in any residential district, a developer may create
lots that are smaller and arranged differently than those required by this

the planned unit development process in subsection
10-4-3C of this title.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Application For Cluster Development: Applicants seeking approval of a
cluster development shall proceed according to the requirements for major
subdivision approval, but shall label all submissions "Cluster Subdivision
Application" and shall comply with the provisions of this section.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Project Size And Density: No cluster in the RE district shall establish
more than twenty (20) lots. The maximum allowable residential density for
clustered development varies by zoning district, but shall not exceed one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the maximum density allowed as of right in the
underlying zoning district.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Open Space Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Minimum Open Space: All cluster developments shall have a minimum of
thirty percent (30%) of the gross land area preserved as open space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Dedication Of Open Space: Where possible, open space to be dedicated
for public use shall be located to provide access to or provide protection of
adjacent public lands.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Ownership And Maintenance Of Open Space:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The applicant for cluster development shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Offer to dedicate land to the public; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Convey open space to be held in common to subsequent owners
of lots and parcels in the development; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Where agricultural land is to be preserved, create an
agricultural easement over that portion of the property to be protected.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â City approval of the form of the dedication or conveyance is
required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Open space that is to be held in common shall be owned and
maintained by an organization established by the applicant/developer and
approved by the city. The applicant shall submit covenants and restrictions
regarding permanent maintenance of the open space, including provisions
addressing:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Maintenance duties of the organization;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The manner in which lot owners will be assessed by the
organization;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Conditions of default; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The manner of enforcement by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Open Space Allocation: Open space shall be provided for each phase
of a development as required by the city. If common open space will not be
provided proportionally by phase, the developer may be required by the city
council to execute a reservation of common open space by grant of an easement
or covenant in favor of the city, dedicating to the city all or a portion of
such reserved area as common open space in the event that the development is
not completed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Open Space Design And Improvements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Open space areas shall be arranged to maximize access and use by
residents of the cluster development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Where open space improvements are provided, a safe, secure and
barrier free system of trails, paths and walkways shall be designed. The
walkways shall link residences with recreation areas, schools, commercial areas
and public facilities.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Improvements may include the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Paved pedestrian paths, located in street rights of way or
pedestrian easements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Paved bikeways, designed in accordance with city standards;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Trails for equestrians, paved with soft materials such as
wood chips or gravel; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Other improvements as required by the city.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Project Landscaping And Compatibility Requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Buffering: The perimeter of a cluster development shall be buffered
from adjacent property pursuant to section
10-8-5 of this chapter. If the cluster development has the same zoning as the
adjacent lot, a type B buffer yard shall be required. Project landscaping
design shall be established in conjunction with the preliminary plat approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Design And Installation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A project landscape, open space and screening plan shall be
prepared by a registered landscape architect.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The developer will be required to establish a permanent ground
cover in the landscape area to stabilize the soil to prevent erosion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Berms or screening walls shall be approved by the city and
completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Material colors for screening walls shall be limited to earth
tone colors. The color shall be uniform for the entire length of the wall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â All landscaping plants shall be living and maintained in a sound,
healthy, vigorous growing condition.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Phasing: An applicant may propose that a cluster development project be
developed in phases, or the city may require the applicant to divide the
project into phases in order to meet requirements and standards contained in
this title. Each phase must contain a mix of residential uses, densities and
open space so as to make the phase self-sufficient, meeting the requirements,
standards and conditions applicable to the project as a whole. Each phase of
the project shall be supported by adequate facilities and services. The public
works director shall determine the adequacy of emergency access, and the city
may require secondary access for any cluster subdivision establishing thirty
(30) or more homes. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-8-4: PARKING AND LOADING STANDARDS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Parking Required For All Structures: For all buildings or structures

center of Van Buren Avenue to the center of Madison Avenue.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Standards For Unlisted Uses: The community development director, or
their designee, shall determine the number of parking spaces required for uses
not referenced in
table 8-3  (subsection B9 of this section) by applying the standard for the
most similar use or uses as listed in the table. If there is no similar use,
the community development director, or their designee, shall make a
determination based on available parking studies or standards.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 1. Â Â Â See table 8-8 of this section for percentage of lot area to be
landscaped.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Buffer Yard Standards: The following buffer yard standards shall apply
to all subdivisions and to all multi-family, commercial and industrial projects
for which site plans are required. Site plans shall include detailed drawings
of enclosure and screening methods as provided. Table 8-10 of this section
lists the types of buffer yards required between adjacent land uses. Exhibit 8-
7 of this section illustrates the minimum widths and plantings for each type of
buffer yard listed in table 8-10 of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Buffer Yards Required: Buffer yards shall be required between
parcels with different zoning designations and as otherwise required herein.
The full buffer yard is required in addition to other landscaping requirements;
provided however, that buffer yard plantings may be counted toward total
landscape area requirements. The board may authorize a reduction of buffer yard
requirements where the zoning on abutting property is not consistent with the
adopted future land use plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Types Of Buffer Yards Required:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Table 8-10 (subsection E3 of this section) shows the type of
buffer yard required to buffer an adjacent property based on its zoning
district. Exhibit 8-7 (subsection E3 of this section) illustrates a typical
buffer yard for each type. The applicant may choose to install any of the
subtypes of buffer yards. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â For example, if the proposed development is located in an R-4
(multi-family) zoning district and the "adjacent development" is zoned I-1
(industrial), then the applicant shall install a type D buffer. The applicant
may choose between the D-1, D-2 or D-3 buffer yard design. If the applicant
chooses a D-1 buffer yard, a minimum width of twenty feet (20') is required
with a berm or fence and plantings of three (3) evergreen trees, two (2)
deciduous trees and twenty (20) shrubs per one hundred feet (100') of common
property line. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. 2006 Code)

Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Commercial And Industrial Equipment And Lot Screening:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Purpose: The intent of commercial and industrial lot screening is
to ensure that items that cannot be enclosed within a building are screened on
all sides from the view of adjacent rights of way and more restrictive zoning
districts. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Boundary Landscaping: In all C and I districts, except the C-
3 district, five feet (5') of boundary landscaping shall be provided along the
abutting public right of way (the 5 foot boundary landscaping may include the
public right of way) (except an alley). Such landscaping shall consist of a
combination of ground covers and deciduous and evergreen shrubs and may include
trees if they will not obstruct sight distances or vehicular or pedestrian
circulation. No specific spacing shall be required for boundary landscaping if
the landscaping is appropriate to the character of the site and the landscaped
areas are of a size to allow proper owner maintenance. (Ord. 07-O-16, 4-3-2007)
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Salvage Yards And Junkyards: The operator of a junkyard/salvage
yard or industrial storage yard shall comply with all federal, state and local
health and safety regulations.

materials, household goods or furniture, or business equipment or materials for
more than twenty four (24) hours shall not be allowed except where permitted by
this title and shall be in compliance with the following screening standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Loading, Storage And Service Areas: Loading, storage and
service areas shall be visually screened from view of residentially zoned
properties with a decorative fence or wall, dense landscape plantings or berms.
Such screening shall provide at least seventy five percent (75%) overall visual
screening of the loading and service area(s) as viewed from vantage points on
lines perpendicular to the surface of the object(s) being screened.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Wrecking/Disposal Operations, Junkyards/Salvage Yards And
Outside Storage Lots: Wrecking/disposal operations, junkyards/salvage yards and
open storage:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Shall be screened with a wall, or combination wall and
berm, not less than eight feet (8') in height, which shall be of solid, one
hundred percent (100%) opaque construction. The wall design and construction
materials shall be approved by the board of appeals and planning in conjunction
with the issuance of a special use permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Shall be screened on all sides from the view of all
surrounding uses and all streets and rights of way. Junkyards/salvage yards may
be entirely enclosed within an approved building.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Parking Lot Landscaping: For any off street parking lot containing
over ten (10) spaces, or for any combination of parking areas on a single lot
providing more than ten (10) spaces, compliance with minimum landscaping shall
be required. The landscaping shall consist of a combination of ground cover and
deciduous and evergreen shrubs and trees. The required landscaping may be
located within or adjacent to a parking lot, and no specific spacing shall be
required; provided, that the landscaping is appropriate to the character of the
site, and that the landscaped areas are sufficient in size to allow proper
owner maintenance. A minimum of a type B buffer yard with a fence shall be
provided where a parking lot abuts a single-family residence in an RE, R-1, R-
2 and R-2U district.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Irrigation Design Standards: Irrigation systems are beneficial in
efficiently adding water to the cultivated landscape. Irrigation systems,
either manual or automatic, may be used for any landscape areas but shall be
required for development projects that are larger than one-half (1/2) acre in
size. Automatic systems, soaker, spray and drip irrigation systems should be
used as applicable for the type of planting design.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Timing Of Installation Of Required Landscaping: All required
landscaping materials shall be in place prior to occupancy, weather permitting.
In periods of adverse weather conditions, temporary approval to occupy may be
granted, subject to the posting of a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of
credit in an amount equal to one and one-half (11/2) times the estimated cost
of the landscaping, with the estimated cost to be certified by a landscaping
provider. The cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit may be forfeited if
the landscaping is not completed within one year after the approval of the
temporary occupancy. Forfeiture of any cash escrow or irrevocable letter of
credit shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility to maintain the
required landscaping.
Â Â Â J.Â Â Â General Landscaping And Site Maintenance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The applicant, property owner and/or subsequent or successor owners
and their agents shall be responsible for maintenance of any landscaping and
any landscaped buffer yard on the property on a continuing basis for the life
of the development as specified in this section. All required landscaping shall
be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include,
but not be limited to, mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering, weeding
and other activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. Failure to
maintain the landscape plantings shall be considered a violation of this title.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds and
other materials or plants not a part of the landscaping.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All required plant material shall be maintained in a healthy,
growing condition as is appropriate for the season. Plant materials that
exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease and/or damage shall be appropriately
treated and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting
season.
Â Â Â K.Â Â Â Planting List For Parkways: Table 8-11 of this section lists trees that
may be planted in medians or within the parkway adjacent to public streets.
Other trees are subject to written approval by the director of public works
prior to planting. The director of public works should be consulted prior to
planting any trees in the right of way to ensure that the trees will not
interfere with existing or planned public facilities.

tract to be subdivided, unless the city council finds that the extension is
prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion
of the city council, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the
coordination of the layout of the subdivision with the existing layout or the
most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
access shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location
of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering
areas, and sidewalks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of movement
between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.

street must temporarily be a dead end street, the right of way shall be
extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de- sac, T or L shaped turnabout
shall be provided on all temporary dead end streets, with the notation on the
subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right of way shall revert
to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued. The city may
limit the length of temporary dead end streets in accordance with these
regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Street Alignment; Jogs: Offset streets shall be avoided where
possible. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty
five feet (125') shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street
intersection has divided lanes without median breaks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Intersection Of Streets: The angle of intersection between

development may be constructed without a turnaround if such street is less than
one hundred twenty feet (120') in length. A street constructed in a phased
development that is longer than one hundred twenty feet (120') shall have a
temporary turnaround.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Alleys: Alleys with a twenty foot (20') wide right of way and
eighteen feet (18') of paved roadway may be required in commercial areas, in
the rear lots of multiple-family districts unless other adequate provisions are
made for service and deliveries, and where justified by special conditions such
as the continuation of an existing alley in the same block. Alleys are not
required in residential districts. Dead end alleys are prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 10.Â Â Â Half Streets: Half streets are prohibited, except where an existing
platted half street abuts the subdivision. Where a platted half street exists,
the other half street shall be required to be completed by the applicant.

shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses,
wherever practicable, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately
parallel to the railroad right of way shall be a sufficient distance from the
railroad right of way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial
sites.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â When streets parallel to the railroad right of way intersect a
street that crosses the railroad right of way at grade, they shall, to the
extent practicable, be a distance of at least one hundred fifty feet (150')
from the railroad right of way. Such distance shall be determined with due
consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades
by means of appropriate approach gradients.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Lot Access: No building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel
that does not abut a public street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Driveways:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Permits: A driveway permit, issued by the public works director,
is required prior to the construction of any new access point. When a traffic
study is required pursuant to subsection I of this section, no driveway permit
will be issued until the traffic study process has been completed. Any
nonresidential change in use resulting in the following will require a new
driveway permit:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An increase of greater than fifty (50) peak hour trips; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A ten percent (10%) increase in average daily trips; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Over ten (10) additional daily vehicle trips made by vehicles
exceeding thirty thousand (30,000) pounds in gross vehicle weight.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Determination Of Boundaries: For the purposes of evaluating
driveway permit requests, the boundary of the site is considered to be all
contiguous parcels under the same ownership on the effective date hereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Driveway Design Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The minimum driveway width shall be twelve feet (12') for
residential and fifteen feet (15') for nonresidential land uses, and the
maximum driveway width shall be twenty four feet (24') for residential and
thirty five feet (35') for nonresidential land uses. The minimum thickness
shall be six inches (6") within the right of way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The driveways accessing paved roads shall provide an asphalt
or concrete driveway approach from the property line to the roadbed edge.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Access Spacing Standards: Minimum spacing between adjacent driveways
or a proposed driveway and an adjacent street intersection is shown in table 9-
2 of this section.

Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Roadway types refer to anticipated cross section based on major
street map. All traffic volumes refer to 20 year forecast.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Access separation between driveways shall be measured from
centerline to centerline.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Access separation between a driveway and intersecting street shall
be measured from the centerline of the driveway and the nearest point of
curvature of the intersecting street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â May require installation of turn lanes.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â This standard is not applicable to single-family and duplex
residential lots existing as of the effective date hereof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Design Objectives: In reviewing an application for a driveway or
access permit for any nonresidential or multi-family use, the public works
director shall determine that the following objectives have been met:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Adequate clearance from any adjacent street intersection has been
provided, and spacing from adjacent driveways is sufficient to safely minimize
conflicts between traffic entering and exiting adjacent driveways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Auxiliary lanes are provided as needed to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minimize speed differentials with mainline highway traffic;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prevent the encroachment of turning vehicles on mainline
traffic; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Prevent the queuing of inbound traffic from impacting
mainline traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Sufficient storage distance between the curb line and the first
point of conflict for traffic on the site is provided to prevent the backup of
traffic onto public streets. This distance shall be adequate to absorb the
maximum peak period inbound traffic during the normal weekday.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Appropriate conflict reduction measures have been provided to
safely manage inbound and outbound traffic. Median design features and driveway
channelization shall be used, as appropriate, to accomplish conflict reduction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Access locations have been properly offset from driveways or
street intersections located across the roadway in order to limit conflicts
within the mainline or median of the street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â The design of the access satisfies standard geometric guidelines
for turning radii, driveway slope, angle of entry, design speed and width. The
access grade within the public right of way shall not exceed three percent
(3%). The drainage design of the access should not interfere with the drainage
system in the public right of way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â The access provides for the safe crossing of pedestrians, the
handicapped and bicyclists.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â The installation of necessary traffic control devices for the
safe and proper operation of the access meets the requirements adopted by the
city and, in the case of traffic signals, are located so as to allow for proper
signal coordination and adequate left turn storage needs at the access and
nearby intersections.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Except in the A zoning district, no single-family or two- family
lot smaller than one acre shall be created which is accessed from an arterial
street or a major collector street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â These standards are not intended to preclude access to existing
lots. Where the city standards would preclude access to a lot, the board of
appeals and planning may vary the access standard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Substandard Access: Where access standards of subsection F6 of this
section, or the design objectives of subsection F7 of this section cannot be
met, the public works director may grant a reduction in spacing standards of up
to twenty percent (20%). If this is not a feasible alternative, a substandard
access permit may be granted subject to the variance provisions of subsection
10-4-3J of this title and the following findings:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Conditions or circumstances exist which limit the strict
application of the requirements of this title, including the lack of a
secondary access to another public street, the inability to use joint access,
and the lack of engineering or construction solutions that can be applied to
mitigate the condition;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The proposed access will not result in undue delay or congestion
or be detrimental to the safety of the motoring public using the roadway; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The limiting access will create an exceptional and undue hardship
on the applicant and that the permit issued will allow a reasonable use of the
property.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Oversizing Streets:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Where a street runs through the proposed subdivision, the applicant
shall be responsible for the construction of such street to a collector street
standard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the traffic impact analysis indicates that the street will exceed
the collector standard, the applicant shall be required to construct the
designated street, subject to reimbursement by the city for the construction
cost of the difference between the collector street and a minor arterial
street. Should reimbursement funds by the city not be available, the
applicant's responsibility for construction shall be limited to a collector
standard; however, the design shall be modified to facilitate future expansion
of such street. Any required improvements deleted by the public works director
in order to facilitate the future street expansion shall not relieve the
responsibility of the subdivider for such improvements. The cost of such
deleted improvements shall be paid to the city. Such monies shall be deposited
in a street construction fund such as a transportation improvement fee fund,
which may be expended by the city council for the purpose of construction of
arterial and collector streets within the city. Should the subdivider make such
payments, he shall be relieved of any obligation for the completion of such
deleted improvements.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â Other Improvements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Sidewalks And Pedestrian Path Standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Sidewalks or pedestrian paths shall be required along all
streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Sidewalks or pedestrian paths shall be required along all
collector and arterial streets located within one mile of the city, unless
otherwise approved by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Walkways shall be designed to comply with the Illinois Americans
with disabilities act; provided, that the council may approve a different
standard for walkways across private property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â All required walkways shall be located within a dedicated right
of way or access easement. A median strip of grass or landscaped area at least
three feet (3') wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs unless
approved by the public works director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Sidewalk and path easements shall be a minimum of ten feet (10')
in width if adjacent to a public street or land. The minimum width of the
sidewalk/path easement between the rear or side lot lines of a parcel shall be
fifteen feet (15'), unless approved otherwise by the city council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Street Signs: The applicant shall deposit with the local government
at the time of final subdivision approval the set fee for each road sign
required by the public works director. The city shall install all road signs
before issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any residence on the streets
approved. Street name signs shall be placed at all intersections within or
abutting the subdivision, the type and location of which shall be approved by
the public works director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Street Lighting: Installation of streetlights shall be required in
accordance with design and specification standards approved by the public works
director.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Utilities:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Location: All utility facilities, including, but not limited to,
gas, electric power, telephone and CATV cables, shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. All utility facilities existing and proposed
throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Easements: Easements, as required by the public works director,
shall be provided for utilities (private and municipal), and such easements
shall be at least ten feet (10') wide. Proper coordination shall be established
between the subdivider and the applicable utility companies for the
establishment of utility easements established in adjoining properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Street Trees: Street trees shall be planted in accordance with
section
10-8-5 of this title unless the board of appeals and planning, upon
recommendation of the public works director, grants a waiver. The waiver shall
be granted only if there are trees growing along the right of way or on the
abutting property that, in the opinion of the board of appeals and planning,
comply with these regulations.
Â Â Â I.Â Â Â Traffic Impact Analysis:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Intent: The intent of this subsection is to provide the information
necessary to allow decision makers to assess the transportation implications of
traffic associated with a proposed development, to address the transportation
related issues associated with development proposals that may be of concern to
neighboring residents, business owners and property owners, and to provide a
basis for negotiation regarding improvements and funding participation in
conjunction with an application for development. This subsection establishes
requirements for the analysis and evaluation of transportation impacts
associated with proposed developments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Scope And Purpose: A traffic impact analysis will be required for
certain permitted and special uses, major subdivisions and site plans exceeding
specific trip generation thresholds. The purpose of a traffic impact analysis
will be to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Evaluate traffic operations and impacts at site access points
under projected traffic loads.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Evaluate the impact of site generated traffic on affected
intersections in the vicinity of the development site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Evaluate the impact of site generated traffic on the quality of
traffic flow on public streets located in the vicinity of the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Evaluate the impact of the proposed development on residential
streets in the vicinity of the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Ensure that site access and other improvements needed to mitigate
the traffic impact of the development meet commonly accepted engineering design
standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Ensure that adequate facilities for pedestrians, transit users
and bicyclists have been provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Identify transportation infrastructure needs and related costs
created by the development and cost sharing on needed improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Applicability: Traffic impact analysis shall be required for any
land use plan amendment, amendment to the zoning map, land subdivision permit,
special use permit, rezoning or site plan under the following conditions:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The proposed use will generate more than one hundred twenty five
(125) trips per acre per day according to the most current versions of the ITE
trip generation informational report or comparable research data published by a
public agency or institution, and which will generate, based on the size of the
development, seven hundred fifty (750) or more average daily trips; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The proposed development will concentrate one thousand five
hundred (1,500) or more trips per day through a single access point.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Waiver: The requirements of this subsection for a traffic impact
analysis may be waived by the public works director when it is determined that
such report is not necessary to determine needed road improvements or that no
unsafe or hazardous conditions will be created by the development as proposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Preparation: The traffic impact analysis shall be prepared by an
Illinois professional engineer, with experience in the preparation of such
analysis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Traffic Service Standards: The standards for traffic service that
shall be used to evaluate the findings of traffic impact studies are:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Capacity: A volume to capacity (V/C) ratio of 0.90 shall not be
consistently exceeded on any arterial or collector street as designated on the
thoroughfare plan. "Consistently" means that the V/C ratios are exceeded based
on average daily peak hour traffic counts, projections or estimates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Level Of Service: For local streets, a level of service C or
better shall be maintained. On any arterial or collector street, a level of
service D or better shall be maintained. Where the existing level of service is
below these standards, the traffic impact analysis shall identify those
improvements needed to maintain the existing level of service and what
additional improvements would be needed to raise the level of service to the
standards indicated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Number Of Access Points: The spacing of access points shall
comply with ASHTO standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Local Street Impact: Average daily traffic (ADT) on local streets
shall be within the ranges spelled out in the thoroughfare plan for the class
of street involved. No nonresidential development shall increase the traffic on
a local street with at least three hundred (300) average daily trips by more
than twenty five percent (25%).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Internal Circulation: On site vehicle circulation and parking
patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic on
any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Safety: Access points shall be designed to provide for adequate
sight distance and appropriate facilities to accommodate acceleration and
deceleration of site traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â Contents: A traffic impact analysis shall contain information
addressing the following factors:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Site Description: The report shall contain illustrations and
narrative that describe the characteristics of the site and adjacent land uses
as well as expected development in the vicinity which will influence future
traffic conditions. A description of the proposed development, including access
plans, staging plans and an indication of land use and intensity, shall be
provided.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Study Area: The analysis shall identify the geographic area under
study and identify the roadway segments, critical intersections and access
points to be analyzed. The focus shall be on intersections and access points
adjacent to the site and roadways or intersections within one-fourth (1/4) mile
of the site.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Existing Traffic Conditions: The report shall contain a summary
of the data used in the analysis of existing traffic conditions, including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Traffic count and turning movement information, including the
source of and date when traffic count information was collected;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Correction factors that were used to convert collected
traffic data into representative design hour traffic volumes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Roadway characteristics, including the design configuration
of existing or proposed roadways, existing traffic control measures (speed
limits, traffic signals, etc.) and existing driveways and turning movement
conflicts in the vicinity of the site; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The existing level of service for roadways and intersections
without project development traffic using methods documented in the "Special
Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual", published by the transportation research
board, or comparable accepted methods of evaluation. Level of service should be
calculated for the weekday peak hour and, in the case of uses generating high
levels of weekend traffic, the Saturday peak hour.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Horizon Year(s) And Background Traffic Growth: The report shall
identify the horizon year(s) that were analyzed in the study, the background
traffic growth factors for each horizon year, and the method and assumptions
used to develop the background traffic growth. Unless otherwise approved by the
public works director, the impact of development shall be analyzed for the year
after the development is completed and twenty (20) years after the development
is completed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Traffic Assignment: The report shall identify projected design
hour traffic volumes for roadway segments, intersections or driveways in the
study area, with and without the proposed development, for the horizon year(s)
of the study.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Mitigation/Alternatives: In situations where the traffic level of
service standards are exceeded, the report shall evaluate each of the following
alternatives for achieving the traffic service standards:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Identify where additional right of way is needed to implement
mitigation strategies;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Identify suggested phasing of improvements where needed to
maintain compliance with traffic service standards; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Identify the anticipated cost of recommended improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â Process For Review And Preparation Of A Traffic Impact Analysis: The
following steps provide an outline of the steps to be included in the
preparation and review of a traffic impact analysis:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The public works director and community development director, or
their designee, shall be consulted for assistance in determining whether a
traffic impact study needs to be prepared for a proposed development
application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The public works director and community development director, or
their designee, shall meet with applicants to identify study issues,
assumptions, horizon years and time periods to be analyzed, analysis
procedures, available sources of data, past and related studies, report
requirements and other topics relevant to study requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Following initial completion of a traffic impact analysis, the
report shall be submitted to the community development director, or their
designee, for distribution to the staff of all jurisdictions involved in the
construction and maintenance of public roadways serving the development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Within ten (10) working days, staff shall complete an initial
review to determine the completeness of the report and shall provide a written
summary to the applicant outlining the need for any supplemental study or
analysis to adequately address any deficiencies. A meeting to discuss the
contents and findings of the report and the need for additional study may be
requested by the applicant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Following a determination that the analysis is complete, staff
shall prepare a report outlining recommendations that have been developed to
address the findings and conclusions included in the study regarding the
proposed development's access needs and impacts on the transportation system.
Depending on the type of application, the recommendations may be presented to
the board and/or council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â In the case of a traffic impact analysis showing deficiencies
requiring mitigation within the public right of way, negotiations based on the
findings and conclusions resulting from the traffic study shall be held with
the city council. A development agreement, detailing the applicant's
responsibilities and the city's responsibilities for implementing identified
mitigation measures, shall be prepared following the negotiations for action by
both parties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â Remedial Action When Standards Not Met: If staff finds that the
proposed development will not meet applicable service level standards, staff
shall recommend one or more of the following actions by the public or the
applicant:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Reduce the size, scale, scope or density of the development to
reduce traffic generation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Divide the project into phases and authorize only one phase at a
time until traffic capacity is adequate for the next phase of development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Dedicate right of way for street improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Construct new streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Expand the capacity of existing streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â f.Â Â Â Redesign ingress and egress to the project to reduce traffic
conflicts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â g.Â Â Â Alter the use and type of development to reduce peak hour
traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â h.Â Â Â Reduce background (existing) traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â Eliminate the potential for additional traffic generation from
undeveloped properties in the vicinity of the proposed development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â j.Â Â Â Integrate nonvehicular design components (e.g., pedestrian and
bicycle paths or transit improvements) to reduce trip generation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â k.Â Â Â Implement traffic demand management strategies (e.g., car or van
pool programs, flex time, staggered work hours, telecommuting, etc.) to reduce
trip generation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â l.Â Â Â Recommend denial of the application for development for which the
traffic analysis is submitted. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003; amd. Ord. 2025-O-5, 2-
18-2025)
10-9-7: PARKS, PLAYGROUNDS AND OPEN SPACE AREAS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â General Requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â All residential subdivisions shall be designed to satisfy the
neighborhood park and open space needs of the subdivision residents as shown in
this section. Such needs shall be met by dedication and acceptance of public
park land and/or by a reservation by covenant of private space, provided there
shall exist sufficient covenants, running with the land, to ensure adequate
maintenance by the property owners identified in the covenants.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The city council shall determine the acceptability of dedicated
lands or the development of park and recreational facilities in the
subdivision, as the council deems appropriate, to meet the requirements of this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â No building permit shall be issued until the provisions of this
section are satisfied.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â This section applies to the development of all land for residential
use in the city, regardless of the zoning.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Dedication Of Open Space Lands:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Schedule:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Minimum Requirement: If the city council determines that the
dedication of land by the applicant is acceptable and in compliance with this
section, such dedication shall be by warranty deed from the applicant to the
city or shall be dedicated by the plat. The amount of land required to be
dedicated shall be not less than one-half (1/2) acre per one hundred (100)
dwelling units.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Calculation Of Open Space: The minimum required dedication of
open space shall be in addition to minimum required yard areas and space
reserved for off street parking required in section
10-8-4 of this title. The percentage of space required to be dedicated shall be
based upon the total area of the development or subdivision used for
residential development, excluding any commercial use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â General Requirements: All lands to be dedicated shall meet the
following general requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Size And Shape: The tract shall not contain less than four (4)
acres unless the city council finds the tract to be of an adequate size to
efficiently meet the parks and recreation needs of the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Location And Accessibility: The tract shall be located in or
adjacent to the subdivision and easily accessible to same. Consideration shall
be given to placing parks where they can be added to by future subdivisions, or
are in addition to an existing park.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Topography; Drainage: At least fifty percent (50%) of the park
area shall have a grade less than four percent (4%). The balance may be covered
with steep slope, streams, ditches, lakes or other natural features.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Natural Features: Features such as trees, brooks, hilltops and
views shall be preserved whenever possible. The subdivider shall designate or
show, at the time of filing the final plat, the trees and other natural
features that are to be retained. The preservation and creation of lakes and
wooded areas are encouraged.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Private Recreation Facilities: The city council may, at its sole
discretion, authorize open space, parks or recreation facilities to be
constructed and maintained by the applicant or other persons to satisfy the
requirements of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Recreation Sites: Land reserved for recreation purposes shall be of
a character and location suitable for use as a playground, play field, or for
other recreation purposes, and shall be relatively level and dry, and shall be
improved by the developer to the standards required by the board of appeals and
planning, which improvements shall be included in the development improvement
agreement and security. A recreation site shall have a total frontage on one or
more streets of at least two hundred feet (200'), and no other dimension of the
site shall be less than two hundred feet (200') in depth and a size in
conformance with the National Recreation and Park Association standards. The
board of zoning appeals and planning may refer any subdivision proposed to
contain a dedicated park to the parks and recreation advisory board for a
recommendation. All land to be reserved for dedication to the city for park
purposes shall have prior approval of the city council and shall be shown
marked on the plat "Reserved For Park And/Or Recreation Purposes".
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Other Recreation Reservations: The provisions of this section are
minimum standards. None of the provisions of this section shall be construed as
prohibiting a developer from reserving other land for recreation purposes in
addition to the requirements of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Cash Payment In Lieu Of Land Dedication:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The city council may require the payment of a fee in lieu of
dedication of land based on the appraised value of the land being platted and
the amount of land required to be dedicated, if, in the judgment of the city
council, the quantity of land to be subdivided is of a size or configuration
that dedication of a portion thereof:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Is not feasible or practical; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Will not create a parcel suitable for neighborhood park
development or for usable open space or trails; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The land is adjacent or readily accessible to already
existing public park or recreational facilities or publicly maintained open
space.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The fee shall be paid at the time of final platting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The developer shall furnish an appraisal of land value for the
purpose of determining the cash payment due in lieu of land dedication. The
appraisal shall be prepared by a state of Illinois certified appraiser and
shall indicate the average value of the land within the proposed subdivision
prior to development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â All fees in lieu of dedication payments shall be deposited in a
separate fund established by the city, and such funds and the interest thereon
shall be used only for the purchase and development of neighborhood park and
recreational facilities.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Resubdividing; Open Space Requirements: Any lands resubdivided after
the effective date hereof shall be subject to the provisions of subsection B of
this section; except, that land previously dedicated or cash payments made in
lieu of land dedication will be credited against the obligations of the
subdivider. In no instance will lands dedicated to the city, or cash payments
made in lieu of land dedication, be returned to the applicant as a result of
resubdivision. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)

10-10-1: PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that persons and businesses desiring
to exercise their rights, under the first amendment of the U.S. constitution,
by expressing commercial and noncommercial messages, shall be treated uniformly
while ensuring that the public health, safety and welfare are protected. This
chapter has the following specific objectives:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and
maintained so that the public safety and traffic safety are not compromised;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To allow and promote positive conditions for sign communications while
at the same time avoiding nuisances to nearby properties and promoting an
attractive environment;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To reflect and support the desired character and development patterns
of the various zoning districts;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â To allow for adequate and effective signs in commercial and industrial
zones while preventing signs from dominating the appearance of the area; and
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is
protected. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-10-2: COMPLIANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
Other than lawful nonconforming signs, no signs shall be permitted in any
zoning district except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and
shall require a sign permit in conformance with the provisions in subsection
10-4-2F of this title. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-10-3: APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the erection, alteration,
reconstruction, construction and maintenance of all on premises and off
premises signs and billboards within the city.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â To the extent that any other provision of this title shall be more
restrictive than the provisions set forth in this chapter, the more restrictive
provision shall apply.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The sections, paragraphs, clauses, and phrases of this chapter are
severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this
chapter shall be declared unlawful by the valid judgment, decree or injunction
order of a court of competent jurisdiction, such ruling shall not affect any of
the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this
chapter. In the event that, contrary to the policies, interests, and values of
the city, a court of competent jurisdiction issues a judgment, decree or
injunction order that this chapter is unlawful because of any omission or
prohibition in this chapter, then all provisions of this chapter not
specifically declared to be unlawful shall remain in full force and effect. In
the event that a judgment, decree or injunction order declaring all or a
portion of this chapter to be unlawful is reversed or vacated by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the provisions contained in this chapter shall remain
in full force and effect.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no sign shall be
subject to any limitation based on the content of message contained on such
sign. Any sign authorized in this chapter may contain noncommercial copy in
lieu of any other copy. (Ord. 03-O-9, 3-18-2003)
10-10-4: SIZE AND HEIGHT:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Maximum On Premises Sign Area Per Lot, Tract Or Parcel:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The maximum allowable sign area permitted for on premises signs for
any lot or parcel shall be computed by applying the maximum sign area permitted
in a zoning district contained in table 10-1 (subsection A3 of this section).
Lots fronting on two (2) or more streets are allowed to include the sum of all
street frontages when calculating total allowable maximum on premises sign
area. For example, the property shown in exhibit 10-1 (subsection A3 of this
section) would have a total of two hundred thirty feet (230') of frontage (150'
+ 80').
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The total square footage for window signs, wall signs and awning
signs on the exterior of the building shall not exceed twenty five percent
(25%) of the building face on any elevation. These totals do not count towards
the maximum sign area allowed pursuant to table 10-1 (subsection A3 of this
section). Projecting signs do count towards the maximum sign area. Banners are
allowed and do not count toward maximum sign area if located in an interior
side or rear yard and they are placed more than twenty five feet (25') from the
right of way line. Banners that are placed less than twenty five feet (25')
from any right of way shall be treated as temporary signs pursuant to section
10-10-10 of this chapter.

Â 
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Sign Face Area: On premises signs shall be calculated by measuring from
the extreme boundaries of each sign face. The message area shall include any
emblem, logo, trademark, representation or other display, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it
is placed, but shall not include the supporting framework, bracing, poles,
apron, supports, structural members, decorative fence or wall that is clearly
incidental to the sign and not a part of the message. The sign area of on
premises directional signs shall not be included in the measurement of the
total sign area. Billboards and off premises sign area calculations shall
include the border and trim.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Cabinet Signs: The sign area is determined by multiplying the width
by the height as shown in exhibit 10-2 (subsection B4 of this section). The
sign area of round cabinet signs shall be calculated based on the radius of the
sign with the formula shown in exhibit 10-2 of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Back To Back Signs: The sign area of back to back signs shall be
calculated as shown in exhibit 10-3 (subsection B4 of this section). If the
sign faces are parallel or within ten degrees (10Â°) of parallel, then only one
sign face is measured. If there is a separation of more than three feet (3')
between faces or an angle greater than ten degrees (10Â°), then each sign face
shall be calculated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Multiple Signs: The sign area for multiple signs shall be calculated
by taking the sum of the sign area for each individual cabinet. For example, in
exhibit 10-4 (subsection B4 of this section), the sign area would be:
(A x B) + (C x D) + (E x F)

Â 
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Sign Height: The height of the sign shall be measured from the ground,
excluding berms, filling, mounding or excavations, at the base of the sign or
from the grade level of the adjacent street or highway centerline, whichever is
higher, to the top of highest attached component of the sign. In cases where
the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined due to multiple levels of the
building or topography, the sign height shall be computed on the assumption
that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or grade of the
land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever
is lower. Exhibit 10-5 at the end of this subsection shows the method for
calculating sign height. Where topography neighboring buildings or existing
landscaping would obscure a sign from the adjoining street, the applicant may
request a variance in conformance with subsection
10-4-3J of this title.

10-10-12: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide for the regulation
of signs and sign structures that legally existed prior to the effective date
hereof, but which fail to comply with one or more of the applicable regulations
or standards. It is the intent of this section to specify those circumstances
and conditions under which such nonconformities shall be permitted to continue.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Applicability: This section applies to nonconforming signs and sign
structures that were originally allowed and have been maintained over time.
These signs and sign structures have legal nonconforming status and may
continue so long as they are otherwise legal. Nonconforming signs and sign
structures that were not permitted when they were established and have been
maintained over time have no legal right to continue and shall be terminated.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Status Of Legal Nonconforming Signs: Any on premises or off premises
sign or billboard which was lawfully established, erected or affixed prior to
the effective date hereof and which complied with all regulations in force at
the time it was erected or affixed, but which fails to conform to all
applicable regulations and restrictions of this title, shall be considered a
legal nonconforming sign or billboard. A legal nonconforming sign or billboard
may be continued so long as it is otherwise in conformance with these standards

control and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering
geologist which may make requirements for further work. (Costs inure to the
developer.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the community
development director, or their designee, may specify the time of starting

The purpose of this chapter is to provide specific regulations for the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless service
facilities. In order to accommodate the communication needs of residents and
businesses while protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare of
the community, the city council finds that these regulations are necessary in
order to:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Facilitate the efficient provision of personal wireless services to the
residents of the city, as well as to other persons, firms, and/or corporations
in the vicinity of the city;
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Minimize adverse visual effects of personal wireless service
facilities, through careful design, siting, screening, and landscape buffering
standards;
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Minimize the impacts of personal wireless service facilities on, and
reduce conflicts with, the architectural, historical, tourism and economic
significance of historic structures and districts designated by the federal,
state and local governments;
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Minimize the impacts of personal wireless service facilities on, and
reduce conflicts with, the architectural, historical, tourism and economic
significance of the city's principal commercial and tourist corridor;
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from falling ice and
tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements;
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Promote, encourage and maximize the shared use of existing and approved
towers and base stations to accommodate new personal wireless service
facilities in order to reduce the number of towers needed to serve the
community; and
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Promote, encourage and maximize the use of existing tall structures
that have been established within the community for the collocation of new
personal wireless service facilities. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-2: FINDINGS:
The city council makes the following legislative findings concerning the
relationship these regulations have with the city's general planning efforts:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The city of Charleston adopted an update and amendment to its
comprehensive plan on December 1, 2009 (the "2009 comp plan"), following the
completion of an in depth study of the existing uses and the trends of
development in the city's jurisdiction and within one and one-half (11/2) miles
thereof. The 2009 comp plan incorporates goals and recommendations from earlier
comprehensive plans, provides status reports on activities taken to implement
earlier recommendations and adopts new recommendations to facilitate the goals
described.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The 2009 comp plan recommended, and the city has implemented, a zoning
overlay district called the residential transition area to create a transition
between high density residential and commercial developments and low density
residential uses in order to balance a growing economy with neighborhood
preservation.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A primary characteristic of the residential transition area is the
height restriction applicable therein which limits structures to no greater
than thirty five feet (35').
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The 2009 comp plan states the city of Charleston is committed to
preserving, restoring, and rehabilitating historic structures and the areas
that are significant to Charleston's heritage. The city has expressed that
commitment by taking the following affirmative steps:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â On October 19, 2004, a historic preservation ordinance was
established;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â On January 10, 2007, the city was granted certified local
governments (CLG) status; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â On February 19, 2008, ordinance 08-O-05 granting historic district
designation of 6th and 7th Streets was approved by the city council.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â In addition to the historic district, the most historically and
architecturally significant individual buildings within the city are the "Old
Main" building on the campus of Eastern Illinois University and the Coles
County Courthouse, located downtown.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â The 2009 comp plan recommends the establishment of gateway features at
the four (4) major approaches to the city, including the easterly and westerly
approaches along Lincoln Avenue, to maintain, enhance, and promote tourism,
economic welfare and the natural and aesthetic qualities of Charleston through
encouragement of quality development and beautification efforts by the city and
its residents.
Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The 2009 comp plan supplements and complements the "1996 Charleston
Tomorrow" strategic plan, which expresses a goal to maintain and preserve the
Lincoln Avenue (IL 16) corridor as a gateway entrance to the city.
Â Â Â H.Â Â Â The city has taken affirmative steps to enhance and beautify the
Lincoln Avenue corridor as a gateway entrance to the city, including:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The 2003 unified development code contains special sign regulations
for the Lincoln Avenue corridor; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The city has implemented corner flower projects and constructed new
sidewalks along the Lincoln Avenue corridor. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-3: INTERPRETATION:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The provisions of this chapter are not intended to and shall not be
interpreted or applied so as to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this
chapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between
providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent
that any provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in
conflict with any provision of this title, the provisions of this chapter shall
be deemed to control.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required under
this chapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service or to
install personal wireless service facilities, the city council shall act within
a reasonable period of time after a complete request is duly filed with the
city, taking into account the nature and scope of the request. There shall be a
rebuttable presumption that a reasonable period of time to take final action on
applications for collocated facilities is ninety (90) days and for new
facilities one hundred fifty (150) days; provided that such period shall be
tolled during any time the applicant needs to respond to reasonable requests
for additional information. Any decision to deny such a request shall be in
writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No decision to deny an application for a conditional use permit or a
zoning variation for the construction or installation of a personal wireless
service facility may be based on the environmental effects of radio frequency
emissions to the extent that such facility complies with the FCC's regulations
concerning such emissions.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Nothing herein shall be construed to release any applicant from
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local building, electrical
and occupational safety laws, regulations, codes and rules. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-
2015)

Notes
  1. See FCC 14-153, report and order dated October 17, 2014, pgs. 3 - 4 ("We
  likewise facilitate sharing of transmission equipment by, for example, using
  "neutral-host" DAS that can support multiple providers simultaneously.
1 Promoting shared use in this manner advances several important policy goals
  while creating little or no potential for competitive harm and, indeed,
  promoting opportunities for increased competition... Finally, sharing
  resources - rather than relying on new builds - safeguards environmental,
  aesthetic, historic, and local land-use values.").

Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Reservation Of Rights: The city council, acting in its capacity as and
exercising the commercial rights of a property owner, reserves the right to
deny, for any reason or no reason, the use of any or all city owned property by
any one or all applicants. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-9: PREFERENCE FOR SHARED USE:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The shared use of towers, base stations and distributed antenna systems
("collocation") shall be preferred to the construction of new personal wireless
service facilities. Provided that collocation is accomplished in a manner
consistent with the terms of this chapter, then applications for collocation
facilities may be approved administratively without any new or additional
conditional use permit approval. Proper plans must be submitted and permits
obtained for such collocation facilities as required by the terms of this
title.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â An applicant for a conditional use permit for a new personal wireless
service facility shall submit a report inventorying existing towers, base
stations and distributed antenna system within a reasonable distance from the
proposed site (not less than a 1,000 foot radius) outlining opportunities for
collocation as an alternative to the proposed use. The applicant must
demonstrate that the proposed personal wireless service facility cannot be
accommodated on an existing towers, base stations and distributed antenna
system due to one or more of the following reasons:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Refusal of the owner to permit the collocation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The planned equipment would exceed the structural or service
capacity of existing and approved towers, base stations and distributed antenna
systems, considering existing and approved uses for those facilities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The planned equipment would cause interference with other existing
or approved equipment, which cannot reasonably be prevented; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Existing or approved towers, base stations and distributed antenna
systems do not have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can
function effectively and reasonably.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The city council may consider existing towers and base station sites
located within one and one-half (11/2) miles of city boundaries that are
capable of serving territory within the city when examining an application for
an additional new facility. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-10: CONDITIONS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Conform To Provisions: Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
the personal wireless service facility shall conform to all applicable federal
laws and regulations concerning its use and operation, and shall also conform
to all applicable provisions of this title and all other applicable provisions
of this code.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Preferences: When collocation is not possible for the reasons described
in subsection
10-13-9B of this chapter, and more than one location is capable of providing
roughly equivalent service to close a significant gap in coverage, the city may
direct the location of the new personal wireless service facility in the
following order of preference:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Industrial district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Commercial district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Governmental district (other than city owned land);
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Residential district;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Buildings designated by the federal, state or local government as
having historical or architectural significance; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Geographic districts designated by the federal, state or local
government as having historical or architectural significance.
In the event a site meets more than one preference category, such site shall be
deemed to have the lowest applicable preference. All of the preferences are
subject to compliance with the special regulations described in section
10-13-6 of this chapter.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Consideration For Approval Of Permit: In considering a request for
approval of a conditional use to permit the installation of personal wireless
service facilities the city council shall, in addition to other relevant
standards for approval described in this code, also give due consideration and
weight to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Whether the applicant has sought and been denied the opportunity for
collocation, as described in section
10-13-9 of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Whether the applicant has sought and been denied the opportunity to
locate its personal wireless service facility on a site with a higher
preference according to subsection
10-13-10B of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Whether a significant gap in coverage exists in each applicant's
coverage area for the provision of personal wireless service. A "gap in
coverage" exists when a remote user of such services is unable to either
connect with the land based national telephone network or to maintain a
connection capable of supporting a reasonably uninterrupted communication. This
standard shall be applied separately to each personal wireless service
provider.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Whether the means chosen to fill a significant gap in coverage are
the least intrusive on the conditions set forth in this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Whether there are specific and unique aesthetic, visual and safety
objections relative to such application and/or the subject property, either in
isolation or cumulatively, that are distinct from those generalized concerns
otherwise addressed in this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Whether the proposed site would encroach on a building or district
with historical, architectural or economic significance. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-
2015)
10-13-11: NONCONFORMITIES:
A personal wireless service facility erected prior to November 4, 2014, which
would be prohibited under this chapter shall be considered to be a legal
nonconforming use and/or legal nonconforming structure, as the case may be, and
shall be subject to the rules on nonconforming uses and structures as provided
by chapter 6 of this title. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-12: ABANDONED OR UNUSED TOWERS OR ANTENNAS; ENFORCEMENT; LIEN:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Deemed Abandoned: A tower or transmission equipment shall be deemed
abandoned if, for reasons within the reasonable control of the owner, it
remains unused or unoperated for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months,
unless a shorter abandonment period is provided in the applicable lease, in
which event, the abandonment period specified in the applicable lease shall
govern, and such abandonment shall be as determined by the city council. All or
any portion of a personal wireless service facility deemed abandoned or unused
under this subsection shall be removed according to the decommissioning and
restoration plan described in this section.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Removal And Hearing: All abandoned or unused portions of a personal
wireless service facility shall be removed within six (6) months of the board's
determination that such facilities are abandoned, unless a time extension is
approved by the city council. Before the board makes a finding or issues an
order for removal of the facility resulting from its abandonment, the applicant
and the owner shall be given an opportunity for a predeprivation hearing in the
manner described below:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â When the city believes all or any part of a facility has been
abandoned, the city manager shall cause a notice of facility abandonment to be
sent via first class mail to the owner of the facility. The notice of facility
abandonment shall state the name and address of the owner, the name and address
of the property owner, a summary of the grounds for the city's determination
and describe the opportunity for a hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Failure to request a hearing within twenty one (21) days from the
date of the notice will result in the city council making its determination
solely on the basis of evidence presented by the city staff.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A person may challenge the validity of the notice of facility
abandonment by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to submit evidence
which would disprove abandonment, or the term for which the facility has not
been used or operated is less than twelve (12) months. Upon a request for a
hearing, the city manager shall schedule the hearing for a regular or special
city council meeting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â All parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present
testimony and evidence at the hearing. A request for a continuance of the
hearing date must be made in person before the city council and may be granted
upon a showing of good cause. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at
the hearing.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Notice: Written notice of the board's determination of abandonment
shall be sent via regular mail, and via certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner of the personal wireless service facilities and the
owner of the property, as determined by reference to the records of the chief
county assessment officer.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Decommissioning And Restoration Plan: Prior to receiving a building
permit and/or conditional use permit for the construction of a personal
wireless service facility, the owner and/or operator must include a
decommissioning and restoration plan with the application to ensure such
facility and all related equipment is properly decommissioned. The owner of the
facility and the underlying property owner(s) shall be jointly liable for the
removal of all equipment associated with the facility at the expiration of the
conditional use permit, if any, the end of the useful life of the facility, or
when the facility is abandoned as herein described. The decommissioning and
restoration plan shall contain:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Provisions for removal of the facility and all related equipment,
including those below the soil surface.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Provisions for the restoration of the property and improvements upon
completion of the decommissioning of the facility and all related equipment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â An estimated cost of decommissioning certified by an authorized
agent of the applicant and the financial resources to be used to accomplish
decommissioning.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A right of entry onto the site granted to the city, pursuant to
reasonable notice to effect or complete decommissioning and/or restoration.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Nuisance: Any facility which remains erected more than six (6) months
after the expiration of the conditional use permit, if any, the end of the
useful life of the facility, or the facility is determined to be abandoned
shall be deemed a nuisance.
Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Lien On Costs Of Enforcement Or Removal:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the city incurs any costs to abate the nuisance caused by the
owner and petitioner's failure to perform the applicant's decommissioning and
restoration plan in a timely manner, that cost is a lien upon that underlying
parcel. If, for any one parcel, the city engaged in any enforcement activity or
performed plan activities on more than one occasion during the course of one
year, then the city may combine any or all of the costs of each of those
activities into a single lien.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â To perfect a lien under this section, the city must, within one year
after the cost is incurred, file notice of lien in the office of the Coles
County recorder. The notice must consist of a sworn statement setting out:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â A description of the underlying parcel that sufficiently
identifies the parcel;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The amount of the enforcement or removal cost; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The date or dates when the enforcement or removal cost was
incurred by the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The removal cost is not a lien on the underlying parcel unless a
notice is personally served on, or sent by certified mail, to the applicant and
the person to whom the tax bill for the general taxes on the property for the
taxable year was sent, not less than ten (10) days preceding the removal
activities. The notice must: a) state the substance of this section; b)
identify the underlying parcel, by common description; and c) describe the
city's proposed activity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A lien under this section may be enforced by proceedings to
foreclose as in case of mortgages. An action to foreclose a lien under this
section must be commenced within two (2) years after the date of filing notice
of lien. Failure to file a foreclosure action does not, in any way, affect the
validity of the lien against the underlying parcel.
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Upon payment of the lien cost by the applicant or owner of the
underlying parcel after notice of lien has been filed, the city shall release
the lien, and the release may be filed of record by the owner at his or her
sole expense as in the case of filing notice of lien. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-13: INTERFERENCE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TELECOMMUNICATIONS:
No new or existing telecommunications service shall interfere with public
safety telecommunications. All applications for new service shall be
accompanied by an intermodulation study which provides a technical evaluation
of existing and proposed transmissions and indicates all potential interference
problems related to other telecommunications facilities operating on the same
facility or adjacent property. Before the introduction of new service or
changes in existing service, telecommunication providers shall notify the city
at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of such changes and allow the city
to monitor interference levels during the testing process. If at any time it is
determined by the city council, or its designee, that public safety
communications experience interference from the new, modified, or existing
telecommunications service so as to jeopardize or impede emergency services to
residents of the city, the city shall refer the issue to the appropriate
judicial or administrative forum for dispute resolution, the city's costs for
which shall be borne entirely by the applicant. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
10-13-14: ADDITIONAL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:
Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In addition to the information required elsewhere in this title,
applications for a conditional use permit for a new personal wireless service
facility shall include the following supplemental information:

equipment cannot be mounted on an existing tower or base station;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â A architectural site plan including tower and ground structure
elevations, and landscaping; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â A plan indicating how specific visual impacts created by the
proposed facilities will be minimized.
Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Applications for a building permit for a new personal wireless service
facility shall include a report from a qualified and licensed professional
engineer which includes, to the extent applicable, information that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Describes the tower height and design including a cross section and
elevation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Documents the height above grade for all potential mounting
positions for collocated transmission equipment and the minimum separation
distances between transmission equipment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Describes the tower's capacity, including the number and type of
transmission equipment that it can accommodate;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Includes a professional engineer's stamp and registration number;
Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Describes the wind rating of the tower and the manner in which the
tower is designed to fail; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Includes any other information necessary to evaluate the request.
Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For all new personal wireless service facilities, the applicant shall
submit to the city a letter of intent committing the owner and his or her
successors to allow the shared use of the tower or base station if an
additional user agrees in writing to meet reasonable terms and conditions for
shared use.
Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the applicant is not the owner of the subject property, the
applicant shall submit to the city a copy of the lease agreement pursuant to
which the applicant is granted authority to erect the proposed personal
wireless service facility.
Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The city shall be given not more than thirty (30) days to review an
application and provide prompt notice to the applicant of whether the
application is complete. A failure to provide notice shall result in the
application being deemed complete. (Ord. 15-O-16, 5-5-2015)
