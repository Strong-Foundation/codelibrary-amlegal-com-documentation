member is attending the meeting by use of a telephone conference call or other
electronic means, identify the method of attendance and the reason why the
absent member is participating by such means.
      7.   If the Village President attends the meeting through the use of a
telephone conference call or other electronic means, he or she shall vacate the

call or other electronic means, after being identified by the other Village
Board members as belonging to the absent member, shall be simultaneously
broadcast to the public present at the meeting so that his or her voice can be
heard, and the member shall also be able to hear any discussions of the other
members and the public comment regarding any issue discussed at the meeting
before a vote is taken.
      9.   The reasons for which an absent member of a Village Board may
participate in a meeting by use of a telephone conference call or other
electronic means are limited to those reasons set forth in subsection D5 of

or other electronic means shall publicly state the reason(s) for his or her
absence and the reason(s) shall be made part of the record of the meeting.

CHAPTER 27
IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION POLICY
SECTION:
1-27-1: Established
1-27-2: Purpose And Definitions
1-27-3: Identification Of Red Flags
1-27-4: Detecting Red Flags
1-27-5: Preventing And Mitigating Identity Theft
1-27-6: Administration
1-27-1: ESTABLISHED:
The village of Kildeer ("village") developed this identity theft prevention
program ("program") pursuant to the federal trade commission's red flags rule
("rule"), which implements section 114 of the fair and accurate credit
transactions act of 2003. This program was developed with oversight and
approval of the village board and village administrator's office. (Ord. 09-O-
1047, 8-4-2009)
1-27-2: PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS:
   A.   Requirements Of The Red Flags Rule: Under the red flags rule, every
financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft
prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its
operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to:
      1.   Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those red flags into the program;
      2.   Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program;
      3.   Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate identity theft; and
      4.   Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity
theft. (Ord. 09-O-1047, 8-4-2009)
   B.   Red Flags Rule Definitions: The red flags rule defines "identity theft"
as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a
"red flag" as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   According to the rule, a municipality is a creditor subject to the rule
requirements. The rule defines a municipality as a "financial institution" and
"creditors" to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers,
utility providers, and telecommunications companies. Where nonprofit and
government entities defer payment for goods or services on a recurring basis,
they, too, are to be considered creditors.
   All the village's accounts that are individual village accounts held by
customers of the village whether residential, commercial or industrial are
covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is: (Ord. 15-O-022,
12-15-2015)
      1.   Any account the village offers or maintains primarily for personal,
family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions;
and
      2.   Any other account the village offers or maintains for which there is
a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of
the village from identity theft.
"Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or number that
may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a
specific person", including: name, address, telephone number, social security
number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification
number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or
taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, or
routing code. (Ord. 09-O-1047, 8-4-2009)
1-27-3: IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS:
In order to identify relevant red flags, the village considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with identity theft. The village identifies the following red
flags, in each of the listed categories:
   A.   Notifications and warnings from credit reporting agencies:
      1.   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      2.   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
      3.   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for an
applicant; and
      4.   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer's usual pattern or activity.
   B.   Suspicious documents:
      1.   Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered
or inauthentic;
      2.   Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      3.   Other document with information that is not consistent with existing
customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears
forged); and
      4.   Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged.
   C.   Suspicious personal identifying information:
      1.   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);
      2.   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a
credit report);
      3.   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      4.   Identifying information presented that is consistent with fraudulent
activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing address);
      5.   Social security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      6.   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      7.   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law, social security
numbers must not be required); and
      8.   A person's identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   D.   Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account:
      1.   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change the
account holder's name;
      2.   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up to date account;
      3.   Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use
(example: very high activity);
      4.   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
      5.   Notice to the village that an account has unauthorized activity;
      6.   Breach in the village's computer system security; and
      7.   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   E.   Alerts from others:
      1.   Notice to the village from a customer, identity theft victim, law
enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft. (Ord. 09-O-1047, 8-4-2009)
1-27-4: DETECTING RED FLAGS:
   A.   New Accounts: In order to detect any of the red flags identified above
associated with the opening of a new account, village personnel will take the
following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the
account:
      1.   Require certain identifying information such as name, service
address, relationship to service address (owner or renter), mailing address,
telephone number, or other identification;
      2.   Verify existence of a business entity against the village's business
license database; and
      3.   Independently contact the customer if any information is
questionable in nature.
   B.   Existing Accounts: In order to detect any of the red flags identified
above for an existing account, village personnel will take the following steps
to monitor transactions with an account:
      1.   Verify the identification of customers if they request information
(If request from resident will only accept requests in person or via telephone.
If request from business can accept requests in person, via telephone, via e-
mail, via facsimile.);
      2.   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      3.   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes. (Ord. 09-O-1047, 8-4-2009)
1-27-5: PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT:
   A.   Red Flags Detected: In the event village personnel detect any
identified red flags, such personnel shall take one or more of the following
steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag:

      2.   Contact the customer;
      3.   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access to
accounts;
      4.   Reopen an account with a new number;
      5.   Notify the village administrator for determination of the
appropriate step(s) to take;
      6.   Notify law enforcement; or
      7.   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
   B.   Protect Customer Identifying Information: In order to further prevent
the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to village accounts,
the village will take the following steps with respect to its internal
operating procedures to protect customer identifying information:
      1.   Ensure that its website(s) used for account transactions is secure
or provide clear notice that the website(s) is not secure;
      2.   Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and
computer files containing customer information;

devices;
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act;
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or

retailer of the telecommunications.
INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate or
terminate outside this state.
INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.
RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Term):
Means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state,
directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission
facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or

corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or
permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving

computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,

a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff. 2-1-

   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of four
percent (4.0%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event,
shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by
this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in
the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of four
percent (4.0%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation
of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or
municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any
tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the
amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax
properly due and paid in a municipality in this state which was not previously
allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff. 2-1-2011)
3-11-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff. 2-1-2011)
3-11-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act 1  and any accompanying rules and regulations
created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff.
2-1-2011)

3-11-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff.
2-1-2011)

interstate telecommunications shall be effective with respect to the gross
charges billed by telecommunications retailers on or after July 1, 2011.

municipal telecommunications tax now imposed by the village at the rate of one
percent (1.0%) with respect to the gross charges billed by telecommunications
retailers with respect to the act or privilege of originating in the
municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate and interstate
telecommunications shall continue in effect until July 1, 2011, provided,
however, that any amounts due or payable to the village for any tax periods
ending prior to July 1, 2011, shall nevertheless remain payable as if this
chapter had not been adopted. (Ord. 11-O-002, 2-1-2011, eff. 2-1-2011)

      Woodland Protection: It is the intent of this section to establish
regulations controlling the removal and encouraging the replacement of trees
from public and private property within the village. In so doing, the village
will safeguard the ecological environment, including soil, air and water
quality, habitat, and noise mitigation, and the aesthetic environment including
economic and quality of life benefits of tree and woodland preservation. These
regulations are further intended to serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing
and disturbing of land so as to preserve, insofar as practical, the existing
natural vegetation of the area and to replace as necessary the removed
vegetation with appropriate plant material indigenous to the region.
      1. These regulations shall apply to all new development and forestry.
Forestry would involve the clearing of woodlands*, with or without development.
(*Woodland: an area or stand of trees whose total combined canopy covers an
area of one acre or more and at least 50 percent of which is composed of
canopies of trees having a diameter at breast height (dbh) of at least 10
inches or any grove consisting of 8 or more individual trees having a dbh of at
least 12 inches whose combined canopies cover at least 50 percent of the area
encompassed by the grove. Provided, however, that no trees grown for commercial
purposes shall be considered a woodland.)
      2. A permit should be required for removal or destruction of trees
greater than six inches (6") diameter at breast height (dbh) either for new
development or for forestry with the following exceptions: a) trees requiring
immediate removal for disease and safety reasons, b) trees in nurseries,
preserves, and botanic gardens, c) trees that are invasive or exotic species,
d) removal consistent with good forestry practice and woodland management as
verified by letter of approval by a certified professional forester or
arborist.
      3. For all new development or forestry, a tree survey shall be provided
in conjunction with the tree removal permit application indicating the location
of all trees with a dbh of six inches (6") or more which may include
information on their species, health, and structure and identifying those trees
which are proposed to be destroyed, relocated or preserved.
      4. Forestry - When forestry would result in removal of more than thirty
percent (30%) of the woodland area on the applicant’s parcel, reforestation
shall be provided elsewhere on the parcel or on nearby property to restore the
woodland to at least seventy percent (70%) of its original area. The
reforestation shall comply with the regulations as per section 6-5-9 of the
village code.
      Development - In the event that the submitted plans indicate there are
existing trees that shall be removed for the development of the site, such
trees shall be replaced in accordance with the following:
 
Diameter Size Of Existing Tree (Inches) Number Replacement Trees Trunk Caliper*

      *Trunk caliper in inches as measured diameter at breast height (dbh).
      All replacement trees shall have a minimum trunk size, as noted above,
measured diameter at breast height (dbh) upon installation. Replacement trees
shall comply with regulations as per section 6-5-9 of the village code. All
replacement trees shall be guaranteed for one full year from planting date and,
if replacement of failed trees is necessary, shall be promptly replaced with
trees of the same variety and size.
      5. The applicant is encouraged to relocate trees otherwise expected to be
destroyed.
      6. A final tree inspection approval by the village is required.
      7. Tree protection measures to be taken during construction shall be
specified in the application. (See guidelines set by International Society Of
Arboriculturists.)
      8. Enforcement
      A. The Building Commissioner shall administer the Woodlands Protections
provisions of the Village Code* (See Title 4 of the Village Code).

   Existing buildings.
      (a)   Increases in fire areas of existing buildings.
      (1)   Currently sprinklered buildings. When any existing building that is
classified in a use group that would, if newly constructed, be required to have
an automatic fire sprinkler system and is protected by an automatic fire
sprinkler system, is added to, remodeled, or altered in any manner that
increases the fire areas of the building, regardless of the cost or amount of
increase in fire areas, the additional fire areas shall also be protected by an
automatic fire sprinkler system.
      (2)   Currently non-sprinklered buildings. When any existing building
that is not protected by an automatic fire sprinkler system; and that is not
regulated by the International Residential Code (IRC) as adopted and that
would, if newly constructed, be required to have an automatic fire sprinkler
system is added to, remodeled or altered in any manner that increases the fire
areas of the building, regardless of the cost, so that the fire areas of the
entire building, including the fire areas of the building that were added,
remodeled, or altered, then the fire areas of the entire building, including
the fire areas of the building that were added, remodeled, or altered, shall be
protected by an automatic fire sprinkler system.

work area exceeds fifty (50) percent of the aggregate area of the building,
then the fire areas of the entire building shall be protected with an automatic
fire sprinkler system, regardless of whether such remodeling or alteration
results in an increase in the fire areas of the building.
      (c)   Changes in use group. If the use of any building is changed such
that it is classified in a use group requiring sprinklers, such building shall
comply with the provisions as if it were a newly constructed building.
      (d)   Alternative fire protection for existing buildings. When the Fire
Chief, Director of the Fire Prevention Bureau and Building Commissioner makes a
unanimous written determination, based on factors such as building size,
building construction type, location of the building on the property, the
availability or appropriateness of water as an extinguishing agent, the size of
a new addition, percentage of remodeling or alterations, and the change in use
group classification, that the public health, safety and welfare and the lives
and property of individuals will be adequately safeguarded by alternative fire
protection to be provided pursuant to specific plans approved and incorporated
as part of such written determination, then, on condition that such alternative
fire protection is provided, an automatic fire sprinkler system shall not be
required.
      (e)   Alternative timing for installation of automatic sprinkler system
in existing multi-tenant/condominium buildings. Whenever the provisions of this
section require the installation of an automatic fire-sprinkler system
throughout an existing multi-tenant or condominium building, then each
currently existing and occupied tenant space or condominium unit within said
building and outside of the work area of the related building permit may remain
unsprinklered for a period not to exceed five (5) years following the issuance
of the current permit, subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
      1)    Upon the vacation of an occupied tenant space or condominium unit
the vacated space or unit must be sprinklered prior to any further occupancy;
and
      2)   When any future remodeling or alteration takes place within any
currently unsprinklered tenant space or condominium unit involving a work area
which exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate area of such space or unit,
the tenant space or condominium unit must be sprinklered simultaneously with
the completion of the future work; and
      3)   At the time of the issuance of the current permit the water service
and sprinkler system shall be designed for the entire building; and
      4)   The building water service and sprinkler system shall be installed

be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this
chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter.
      1.   If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
village of Kildeer.
      2.   Facility operators shall allow the village of Kildeer ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an

operator at the written or oral request of the village of Kildeer and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      6.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village of Kildeer access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this
chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the village of Kildeer reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-8-3: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the village of Kildeer has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the village of Kildeer may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-9: REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The village of Kildeer will adopt requirements identifying best management
practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system,
or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of such activity,
operation, or facility shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and nonstructural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises that is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with all terms and
conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. These BMPs shall be part of a
stormwater management plan (SWMP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-10: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials, which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or
pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of
the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the
village of Kildeer in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the village of Kildeer within seven (7) business
days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates
from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on site written record of the discharge and
the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for
at least five (5) years. Failure to provide notification of a release as
provided above is a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-11: VIOLATIONS, ENFORCEMENT, AND PENALTIES:
4-7-11-1: VIOLATIONS:

violate, any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the
village of Kildeer may serve upon that person a written warning notice,
specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting
the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution
whereby any offending discharge will cease.
Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice
in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the warning notice. Nothing in this
section shall limit the authority of the village of Kildeer to take any action,
including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a warning notice. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-11-3: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
   A.   Whenever the village of Kildeer finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the village of

1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-11-4: COMPENSATORY ACTION:
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this
chapter, the village of Kildeer may impose upon a violator alternative
compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance
workshops, creek cleanup, etc. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-11-5: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   A.   Emergency Cease And Desist Order: When the village of Kildeer finds
that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, or any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations
are likely to recur, and that the person's violation(s) has (have) caused or
contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the
United States which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the
village of Kildeer may issue an order to the violator directing it immediately
to cease and desist all such violations and directing the violator to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Any person notified of an
emergency order directed to it under this subsection shall immediately comply
and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the village
of Kildeer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm
to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment to persons or to
the environment, including immediate termination of a facility's water supply,
sewer connection, or other municipal utility services. The village of Kildeer
may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the village of Kildeer that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the village of Kildeer
within seven (7) days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an
emergency cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the violator.
   B.   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
village of Kildeer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the village of Kildeer may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   C.   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
village of Kildeer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the village of Kildeer for a
reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this chapter, without the prior approval of the village
of Kildeer. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-12: CIVIL PENALTIES:
In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth
in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described
therein within fourteen (14) days, or such greater period as the village of
Kildeer shall deem appropriate, after the village of Kildeer has taken one or
more of the actions described above, the village of Kildeer may impose a
penalty not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) (depending on the severity
of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt
of the notice of violation. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-13: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
Any person that has violated or continues to violate this chapter shall be
liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be
subject to a criminal penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation
per day and/or imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed seven (7) days.
Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall
constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-2009)
4-7-14: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
village of Kildeer. The notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) days
from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the
appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within thirty (30)
days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the
municipal authority or their designee shall be final. (Ord. 09-O-1042, 6-2-
2009)
4-7-15: ENFORCEMENT MEASURES AFTER APPEAL:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within seven (7)

   D.   Floor Area Ratio Guidelines And Intent:
      1.   Background: Effective December 5, 1994, by action of the village
board, the zoning regulations of this code were amended to include FAR
restrictions in residential zoning districts. Prior to this action by the
village board, this subject was discussed by the plan commission/board of
appeals at several public meetings and at a public hearing, held on October 19,
1994. The village instituted FAR regulations for the primary goal of ensuring
the size and scale of buildings and structures relate harmoniously to the size
of the lot on which they are located, as well as to the surrounding
neighborhood. (Ord. 95-O-681, 1-4-1995; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)
      2.   Regulated Development: All buildings and structures developed within
R-1 and R-2 single-family residence districts, excluding cluster and townhome
planned developments, are required to comply with the FAR restrictions as
provided for in this title. In each case, the maximum FAR allowed is 0.30. The
following guidelines were prepared to ensure compliance with these regulations
and to provide additional information on the calculation of floor area ratio.
      3.   Review And Approval:
         a.   A completed floor area ratio worksheet (see below) is required
for each lot on which a new building or structure is proposed or on which
modifications are proposed to an existing building or structure (i.e.,
additions) that would increase the floor area from that which presently exists.
         b.   Copies of plats of survey, building plans, and other drawings as
necessary to demonstrate the basis of computations, must accompany the
completed floor area ratio worksheet. Additional support documentation shall be
submitted as required by the village to complete the review.
         c.   Worksheets prepared in conjunction with the construction of a new
residential home or shed/gazebo, etc., must be certified by an engineer or
architect. Worksheets prepared in conjunction with an addition to an existing
building/structure do not require certification. All other applications require
certification by an engineer or architect as determined necessary by the
building commissioner.
         d.   All completed worksheets and support documentation must be
submitted to the village with a building permit application.
         e.   Upon receiving a completed worksheet with all necessary support
documentation, the building commissioner, or appointed designee, shall within
two (2) weeks determine whether the proposed improvements comply with the
applicable FAR requirements.

5-10-1: PURPOSE:
The B business district is established to allow commercial development at
appropriate locations within the village. The retail and service uses allowed
within this district are intended to serve area residents, and enhance the
economic base of the village. The B business district should be located along
arterial roadways where adequate access can be provided without disrupting
residential areas. The high visibility afforded to parcels along these
arterials requires site and building design that enhances the economic
viability of the business and aesthetic quality of the public right of way.
Impacts on existing and future residences, in and adjacent to the village,
should be further minimized by the provision of appropriate perimeter buffers
and by promoting design in this district which is compatible with the character
of Kildeer and viable commercial development. (Ord. 11-O-007, 3-15-2011, eff.

5-10A-1: PURPOSES:
Certain property within the village offers limited opportunities for larger
scale commercial development to serve Kildeer and neighboring communities. Such
property is uniquely located, however, at the gateway to the village and
neighboring villages and abutting and adjacent to established single-family
detached residential areas. Accordingly, such development must be carefully
planned and regulated to avoid the many potential adverse consequences to the
village, to neighboring villages, and to the abutting and adjacent residential
uses, which adverse consequences could result from too dense, poorly buffered,
badly designed, or otherwise ill planned use of such property. The purposes of
the LC limited commercial district are to create regulations that allow the
property zoned within the district to achieve a reasonable amount of commercial
development, to protect the stature and aesthetics of the principal gateway to
the village, to protect and preserve the quality of existing single-family
residential areas, and to protect the village from undesirable impacts of
unnecessary and unwanted intense commercial development. (Ord. 93-O-648, 9-7-
1993)

5-10B-1: PURPOSE:
An office and research district (O&R) is established to allow office and
research development and accessory uses at appropriate locations within the
village. The uses allowed within this district are intended to serve area
residents, and enhance the economic base of the village. The O&R office and
research district should be located along roadways where adequate access can be
provided without disrupting residential areas. The visibility afforded to
parcels along these roadways requires site and building design that enhance the
economic viability of the business and aesthetic quality of the public right of
way. Impacts on existing and future residences, in and adjacent to the village,
should be further minimized by the provision of appropriate perimeter buffers
and by promoting design in this district which is compatible with the character
of Kildeer and viable office and research development. (Ord. 11-O-008, 3-15-

5-13-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of the
public streets, and so promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for the off street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put. (Ord. 76-O-227, 12-2-1976)
5-13-2: GENERAL PROVISIONS, PARKING AND LOADING:
   A.   Scope Of Regulations: The off street parking and loading provisions of
this title shall apply as follows:
      1.   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date hereof, accessory parking and loading
facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in
which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building permit has
been issued prior to the effective date hereof, and provided that construction
is begun within one year of such effective date, and diligently prosecuted to
completion, parking and loading facilities as required hereinafter need not be
provided.
      2.   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through gross floor area, seating capacity or other unit of
measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities,
parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for such
increase in intensity of use.
However, no building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established
prior to the effective date hereof shall be required to provide such additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units
of measurement existing upon the effective date hereof, in which event parking
or loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the total
increase.
Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed
to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for
such new use. However, if the said building or structure was erected prior to
the effective date hereof, additional parking or loading facilities are
mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use would
exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking and
loading provisions of this chapter.
   B.   Existing Parking And Loading Facilities: Accessory off street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served which were in existence on the effective date hereof or were provided
voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced below or
if already less than, shall not further be reduced below the requirements of
this chapter for a similar new building or use.
   C.   Permissive Parking And Loading Facilities: Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings; provided,
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   D.   Damage Or Destruction: For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date hereof, which
subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or
other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off street
parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such
damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in
no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading
facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses
or construction. (Ord. 76-O-227, 12-2-1976)
   E.   Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No off site parking lot shall
change ownership from that of the zoning on which the building or use served by
such facility is located. No such off site parking facilities shall be
authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where the plans call for
parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until and unless the plan
commission/board of appeals has reviewed the plans and heard the applicant and
made findings that the common ownership or possession of the zoning lot and the
site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the
off site parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of
the proposed use or building. (Ord. 76-O-227, 12-2-1976; amd. Ord. 05-O-942,
11-7-2005)
   F.   Submission Of Plot Plan: Any application for a building permit, or for
a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required shall include
therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 76-O-227, 12-2-1976)
5-13-3: ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, PARKING:
   A.   Use Of Parking Facilities: Off street parking facilities accessory to
residential use and developed in any residential district in accordance with
the requirements of this chapter shall be used for the parking of passenger
automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which such
facilities are accessory or by guests of said occupants. Under no circumstances
shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used
for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants,
visitors or customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
   B.   Joint Parking Facilities: Off street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted; provided, that the total number of spaces
so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use.

property nor curb cut shall exceed a width of thirty feet (30').
   E.   In Yards: Except for transitional yards in a B district which are
governed by section

         c.   Alternative materials which provide equivalent strength may be
used subject to approval by the village engineer.
      3.   Screening And Landscaping: All open automobile parking areas
containing more than five (5) parking spaces shall be effectively screened on
each side adjoining or fronting on any property situated in a residence
district by a densely planted compact hedge. Such required screening shall
conform with the front and side yard setback requirements of the district in
which the parking is located.
      4.   Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off street parking areas

create a nuisance.

CHAPTER 14
PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
SECTION:
5-14-1: Purpose
5-14-2: Definitions
5-14-3: Standards
5-14-4: Procedure
5-14-5: Changes In The Planned Development
5-14-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of the planned development provisions is to promote efficient land
patterns in order to preserve trees, wetlands and other natural resources,
provide site amenities, and secure large parcels of permanent open space,
characteristic of Kildeer's existing rural environment. These provisions are
intended to encourage and allow more creative and imaginative design for land
developments than would be possible under the strict application of Kildeer's
conventional Zoning and Subdivision Code provisions. The efficient land
patterns which will result from implementation of these provisions will also
result in more economical land development.
The following objectives of the Village will be attained through the use of the
planned development process:
   A.   Foster high-quality development by allowing flexibility in land use and
design standards, thereby encouraging innovative site planning.
   B.   Promote more efficient land patterns which not only preserve open space
and natural resources, but also provide for more economical networks of
utilities, streets and other facilities.
   C.   Protect the character of existing large lot single-family developments
in the Village by:
      1.   Requiring adequate separation and screening between more intensive
uses and existing large lot development; and
      2.   Promoting compatibility in design between new and existing
developments.
   D.   Promote diverse, high quality, residential environments.
   E.   Permit a land use pattern with a mixture of residential and
nonresidential uses that will maintain, expand, and enhance the existing
residential character of Kildeer.
   F.   Create a method for the permanent preservation of common open space for
the continued use and enjoyment of the residents of the development.
   G.   Provide for usable and suitably located public and private recreational
facilities.
   H.   Encourage developers to provide amenities that enhance the quality of
life, both within the planned development, as well as within the community as a
whole.
   I.   Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
building relationships for developments which include more than one land use.
   J.   Encourage a land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals and welfare. (Ord. 91-O-587, 8-5-1991)
5-14-2: DEFINITIONS:
The following definitions shall apply to planned developments:
BUSINESS: For the purposes of this Chapter, business shall be defined as retail
commercial, office or service uses.
CLUSTER SUBDIVISION: A single-family, detached home residential subdivision,
consisting of three (3) or more residential lots, that concentrates the
buildings on a part of the site to allow the remaining land to be used for
recreation, common open space, and/or preservation of environmentally sensitive
features. This form of development permits a reduction in minimum lot area and
bulk requirements of the underlying zoning provided: a) there is no increase in
the number of lots permitted, or overall density, compared to that which would
be possible under a conventional subdivision; and b) the land outside of lot
area is devoted to open space, active recreation, preservation of
environmentally sensitive areas, or agriculture. The maximum density shall be
determined by the "underlying zoning", defined as follows: The gross site area,
minus an estimated fifteen percent (15%) of the residual site area for rights
of way, divided by forty three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square
feet. While underlying zoning determines the maximum number of lots, actual
allowable density will depend on individual site characteristics.
DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE: An ordinance adopted by the village board upon
completion of both preliminary and final plan approvals which includes graphics
and other support documentation upon which village board approval is based. The
development ordinance shall also specify conditions of approval established by
the village board, if any.
LARGE LOT RESIDENTIAL: For the purpose of this chapter, "large lot residential"
development shall mean detached single-family homes on lots one or more acres
in size.
NET DENSITY: For the purpose of determining the number of units per acre in a
planned development for net density calculations, lot area shall be included,
but not streets, street rights of way, or open space.
OFFICE PARK: A three (3) or more acres planned development developed
exclusively with office or office/research uses shall constitute an office
park.
OFFICE/RESEARCH: For the purposes of this chapter, office/research uses shall
be limited to: offices for general business uses (excluding retail);
professional or religious, philanthropic or fraternal nature; technology and
research centers, including medical and hospital research establishments 1 ; or
other similar uses which may be approved by the village board. Office/research
uses shall meet all applicable standards of village ordinances. Light
industrial, assembly, and laboratory facilities, as such uses relate to the
production of products and parts, shall be prohibited. All research shall be
conducted within enclosed buildings, and ancillary outside storage of materials
shall be prohibited. No use shall be permitted which involves environmentally
hazardous materials, toxic wastes, or contaminants, unless otherwise approved
by the village board.
PLAN: A drawing of a tract of land that contains information related to
proposed development.
PLAN REVIEW COMMITTEE: The group that meets with a petitioner during the
preapplication review stage of the land use regulation process. The committee
shall consist of either:
   A.   The Village Board;
   B.   The Plan Commission; or
   C.   An ad hoc committee as determined by the Village Administrator or
Village President and in each case including. village staff and consultants.
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT: A parcel of land under single ownership or unified
control, for which the specific requirements of the underlying zoning district
may be modified when: a) the proposed development offers benefits to the
neighborhood and/or community of which it is a part, beyond those required by
the zoning code provisions; and/or b) the proposed use of land includes
substantial amenities not otherwise required. This includes, but is not limited
to: provisions for common open space; recreational facilities; or specific
design, engineering, architectural, site planning or landscape features.
A planned development includes a program for the provision, operation, and
maintenance of such areas, facilities, and improvements which will be for
common use by residents of the planned development and/or community, but which
will not be provided, operated, or maintained at public expense.
PLAT OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT AND SUBDIVISION: A drawing representing a tract of
land of the approved planned development, with all approved site data set forth
thereon, and suitable for recording with the Lake County recorder of deeds,
which shows the subdivision or consolidation of one or more properties,
including individual lots or parcels, if any, streets and rights of way,
easements, boundary markers and other site information as required by the
village's subdivision code 2 .
REDEVELOPMENT: Alterations of a business property that do not expand the total
gross floor area as measured from exterior wall surfaces by more than ten
percent (10%).
TOWNHOME: A dwelling containing two (2) or more residential units, each having
a completely separate entrance at ground level.
UNIFIED CONTROL: The combination of two (2) or more tracts of land wherein each
owner has agreed that his or her tract of land shall be developed as part of a
planned development, and shall be subject to all control applicable to and
adopted for the planned development. (Ord. 91-O-587, 8-5-1991; amd. Ord. 96-O-

the planned development with the comprehensive plan, the zoning ordinance,
subdivision ordinance 8, and the goals and policies for planning of the
village. Recommendations relative to a preapplication plan review are advisory
only, and shall not constitute a waiver from the requirements contained in this
code.
      5.   The plan review committee may, at its discretion, require plans and
support documentation to be revised before making a recommendation on the pre-
application plan. This may require additional meetings between the petitioner
and the committee, to assure that the proposed planned development conforms, to
the maximum extent possible, with the applicable code provisions, goals, and
policies of the village.

Board grants final plan approval. As part of the Village Board approval of the
final plan, the Village Board may extend this period of time. An extension of
the two year validity period may be granted by the Village Board prior to the
expiration date of the approval if the applicant requests an extension in
writing prior to the expiration date of the approval.

development approval, once the final plan has expired with no request for
extension pending, the Village Board may initiate a map amendment to rezone the
lot to its most appropriate district classification, as deemed suitable by the
Village Board, acting on the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board.

with the approved plans; provided, construction is started within ninety (90)
days and diligently prosecuted to completion. Such building shall thereafter be
deemed a lawfully established building.
5-16-3: DISCONTINUANCE OF USE:
   A.   Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a
nonconforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the

originally designed and constructed for the prior nonconforming use.
   B.   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure or part thereof
has been discontinued for a consecutive period of one year or whenever there is
evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming use,

or used thereafter only for a conforming use and in compliance with the
provisions of the district in which it is located. In the event the damage or
destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value based
upon prevailing costs, the building may then be restored to its original
condition and the occupancy or use of such building may be continued which
existed at the time of such partial destruction.
In either event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure must
be started within a period of six (6) months from the date of damage or
destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion.

any manner which would increase the degree or extent of its nonconformance with
respect to the bulk regulations of the district in which it is located.
5-16-8: USE DISTRICT CHANGES:
Whenever the boundaries of a use district shall be changed so as to transfer an
area from one use district to another use district of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming
uses existing therein.

the plan commission/board of appeals. The officer from whom the appeal is taken
shall forthwith transmit to the commission/board all the papers constituting
the record upon which the action appealed was taken.
      An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the building commissioner certifies to the plan commission/board
of appeals, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason
of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In this event, the proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the plan
commission/board of appeals or by a court of record on application and on
notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due causes shown.
      The plan commission/board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and decide the
appeal within a reasonable time. Any party may appear in person or by agent or
attorney.

942, 11-7-2005)
5-17-7: VARIATIONS:
   A.   Authority: The village board of trustees shall decide variations of the
provisions of this title in harmony with its general purpose and intent, and
shall vary them only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth where the
plan commission/board of appeals shall have made a finding of fact based upon
the standards hereinafter prescribed that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this title.
   B.   Initiation: An application for a variation may be made by any person,
or by any office, department, board, bureau or commission requesting or
intending to request application for a building permit, zoning certificate or
occupancy certificate.
   C.   Processing: An application for a variation shall be filed with the
village clerk. The village clerk shall forward such application to the plan
commission/board of appeals for processing in accordance with applicable
statutes of the state of Illinois and the provisions of this title.

except after a public hearing before the Plan Commission/Board of Appeals, of
which there shall be a notice as required by 5-12-13.
   D.   Decisions: All recommendations and findings of the plan commission/
board of appeals on variations arrived at after the hearing shall be
accompanied by the findings of fact specifying the reason or reasons for
recommending the approval or disapproval of the variation, and the decision of
the village board of trustees shall be final and subject to judicial review
only in accordance with applicable statutes of the state.
   E.   Standards:
      1.   The board of trustees of the village shall not vary the provisions
of this title as authorized in this chapter, unless it shall have made findings
based upon the evidence presented to it and the plan commission/board of
appeals in the following cases:
         a.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
         b.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
         c.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      2.   A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the judgment
of the village board, sustains each of the three (3) conditions enumerated
above.
      3.   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the board of
trustees in making this determination whenever there are practical difficulties
or particular hardships, shall also take into consideration the extent to which
the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the
evidence:
         a.   That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved will bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out;
         b.   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is
based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoned
classification;
         c.   That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         d.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property;
         e.   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         f.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      4.   The village board may require such conditions and restrictions upon
the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set forth in this chapter to reduce or minimize the effect of such
variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the general
purpose and intent of this title.
   F.   Authorized Variation: Variations from the regulations of this title
shall be granted by the village board only in accordance with the standards set
out in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in
no others:
      1.   To permit up to a twenty percent (20%) reduction in the required
front, side, or rear yard, except that no such variation shall be permitted in
any business or commercial district for any required yard abutting a lot line
in any residential district.
      2.   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but in no
event shall the respective area and width of the lot be less than ninety
percent (90%) of the required area and width. The percentage set forth in this
subsection is not to be reduced by any other percentage for minimum lot width
and area set forth in this title.
      3.   To permit the same off street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two (2) or more uses, provided the substantial uses of
such facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours
of the same days of the week.
      4.   To reduce the applicable off street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or twenty percent
(20%) of the applicable regulations, whichever number is greater.
      5.   To increase by not more than twenty percent (20%) the gross area of
any sign.
      6.   To increase by not more than ten percent (10%) the maximum gross
floor area of any use so limited by the applicable regulations.
      7.   To extend the period of time a nonconforming use may continue or
remain.
      8.   To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this
section when a lot of record or a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on the
effective date hereof, is by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent
domain by any authorized governmental body or by reason of a conveyance under
threat of an eminent domain proceeding reduced in size so that the remainder of
said lot does not conform with one or more of the regulations of the district
in which said lot of record or zoning lot or structure is located.
   G.   Other Variation: Variations other than those listed in subsection F of
this section may be granted by the village board, except in the LC limited
commercial district. No such other variation shall be granted except after a
public hearing as set forth herein for variations generally and a report from

5-17-10: SPECIAL USES:
   A.   Purpose: The development and execution of this title is based upon the
division of the village into districts, within any one of which the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related
to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
special uses, which, because of their unique character, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands and upon the
public need for the particular use or the particular location. Such special
uses fall into two (2) categories:
      1.   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities, or
uses traditionally affected with public interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   B.   Authority: Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the village
board in accordance with the provisions of this title applicable to amendments
of this title and the regulations and conditions set forth in this title for
special uses.
No application for a special use shall be acted upon by the village board until
after:
      1.   A written report is prepared and forwarded to the village board by
the plan commission/board of appeals in a manner prescribed herein for
amendments to this title; and
      2.   A public hearing has been held by the plan commission/board of
appeals after due notice by publication as prescribed herein, for amendments,
and the findings and recommendations of the plan commission/board of appeals
have been reported to the village board.
   C.   Initiation: An application for a special use may be made by any person,
or by an office, department, board, bureau or commission requesting or
intending to request a building permit or occupancy certificate.
   D.   Processing: An application for a special use, in such form and
accompanied by such information as shall be established from time to time by
the plan commission/board of appeals shall be filed with the village clerk and
thereafter introduced to the village board of trustees. Such application shall
be forwarded to the plan commission/board of appeals, with a request to hold a
public hearing. Notice shall be given of the time and place of the hearing in
accordance with section
5-17-13.
The plan commission/board of appeals shall hold a public hearing and forward
its recommendations in the form of a written report to the village board within
thirty (30) days following the date of public hearing on each application
unless it is withdrawn by the petitioner.
The application shall state:
      1.   The proposed use at that particular location requested is necessary
or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the interest of
public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of the
neighborhood or community; and
      2.   Such use will not under the circumstances of the particular case be
detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of persons
residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property values or
improvement in the vicinity; and
      3.   The proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in this title for such use, and with the stipulation and conditions
made a part of the authorization granted by the village board of trustees.
In the case of written protest against any proposed amendment of the
regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of
twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley
therefrom, or by the owner of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly
opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, is filed with the village clerk,
the special use shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of two-thirds
(2/3) of all of the village trustees. Any proposed special use which fails to
receive the approval of a majority of the plan commission/board of appeals
members and is so reported, shall not be passed by the village board except by
a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all the trustees of the village.
      4.   Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this title where an
"adult use" as defined in section
5-1-6 of this title is allowed as a special use in any zoning district, no
other criteria shall be used for granting or denial of the special use permit
than those listed herein:
         a.   The property line of each adult use must be located no less than
five hundred feet (500') from the property line of any other adult use;
         b.   No adult use shall be located within five hundred feet (500') of
a residential zoning district;
         c.   The building line of any adult use shall not be located within
five hundred feet (500') of the property line of any public building, church,
school, library, park or playground.
The adult use, special use permit shall be granted if the aforementioned
criteria are met but shall be subject to revocation if in judicial proceedings
it is found that activities engaged in under such special use permit constitute
obscenity or distribution of harmful material to minors in violation of state
statutes.
   E.   Decisions: The village board, upon report of the plan commission/board
of appeals and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed
special use in accordance with applicable statutes of the state or may refer it
back to the plan commission/board of appeals for further consideration. (Ord.

5-19-1: FINDINGS AND DETERMINATIONS:
The village has determined that satellite antennas of various sizes, shapes,
varieties and configurations can be installed and operated in such a manner as
to be unsightly nuisances not compatible with existing structures and land uses
within the village, and that they further can be located in such a fashion that
the appearance of the structures produces major undesirable consequences for
owners of adjacent properties. The village has further determined that
satellite antennas shall be considered structures for the purposes of this code
subject to all applicable provisions concerning structures. (Ord. 01-O-839, 9-
4-2001)
5-19-2: BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful to install, erect, or operate a satellite antenna system
without prior thereto having secured a building permit therefor prior to the
commencement of construction. (Ord. 84-O-381, 2-5-1984)
5-19-3: BUILDING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS:
The installation, erection, construction and operation of a satellite antenna
system shall be considered a permissible accessory use in all residentially
zoned areas, provided, however, that any such satellite antenna system shall
not exceed four feet (4') in diameter for data communication, nor eight feet
(8') in diameter for video reception purposes. The satellite antenna system
must be ground supported, with the center of the dish no higher than six feet
(6') aboveground. Satellite antenna twenty four inches (24") or less in
diameter may be mounted on the residential structure. For the purposes of this
section "residential zone" shall mean, and include, R-1 single-family
residential district, R-2 single-family residential district, PD-1 single-
family residential district and PD-2 low-density single-family residential
district. (Ord. 01-O-839, 9-4-2001)
5-19-4: SPECIAL USE:
A person desirous of installing, erecting, constructing or operating a
satellite antenna system in excess of the diameter or the height set forth in
section
5-19-3 of this chapter may apply for a special use. The plan commission/board
of appeals shall consider the application in accordance with the procedures set
forth in section
5-17-10 of this title. The plan commission/board of appeals may recommend a
special use to the village board of trustees to construct a satellite antenna
system in excess of the diameter specified in section
5-19-3 of this chapter, provided that the proposed system shall satisfy all the
following criteria: (Ord. 91-O-601, 12-2-1991; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)
   A.   The system as proposed shall be compatible with existing uses in the
surrounding area.
   B.   The construction and installation of the satellite antenna system shall
strictly conform to all applicable village code provisions.
   C.   The proposed satellite antenna system shall have no adverse impact on
adjacent properties.
   D.   The proposed satellite antenna system shall be structurally sound and
adequate for anticipated wind loads, and must have a permanent foundation
therefor.
   E.   The applicant must demonstrate that a larger diameter antenna is
necessary for adequate reception due to the proposed location of the antenna,
or any other unavoidable conditions.
   F.   In any event, the maximum diameter of any satellite antenna installed,
pursuant to a special use, shall not exceed ten feet (10') in diameter, and the
maximum height of the center of the dish shall be no higher than ten feet (10')
aboveground. (Ord. 91-O-601, 12-2-1991)
5-19-5: RESIDENTIAL ZONES ONLY:

      1.   Comprehensive Plan Conformity: Advise the developer of the project's
conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, and its conformity with the sewer
facility plan which delineates the areas to be served by either public and/or
private sanitary sewer service. This will determine the feasibility of the
proposed subdivision and the sizes of utilities and the lots therein.
      2.   Zoning Check: Check the existing zoning of the tract and advise the
subdivider if a zoning change is necessary or desirable.
      3.   Public Facility Impact: Determine the adequacy of existing or
proposed schools, parks and other public spaces in the vicinity of the proposed
subdivision.
      4.   Site Inspection: Inspect the site or otherwise determine its
relationship to major streets, utility systems, natural features, and adjacent
land uses and determine any unusual problems in regard to topography,
utilities, flooding, etc.
      5.   Placement On Board Agenda: Place matter on agenda for next regular
Board meeting.

provisions and conditions of the comprehensive plan. Plat approval may be
withheld if a subdivision does not conform to the provisions of the
comprehensive plan.
      3.   Area Sketch Plan Required: Where a tract of land proposed for
subdivision is part of a larger, logical subdivision unit in relation to the
village as a whole, the plan commission/board of appeals may, before
recommending approval, cause to be prepared by the subdivider a sketch plan for
the entire area or neighborhood, such sketch plan to be used by the plan
commission/board of appeals as an aid in judging the proposed plat.
      4.   Storm Water Provisions Required: The plan commission/board of
appeals shall not recommend for approval by the village board any plat of
subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm water runoff.
      5.   Preservation Of Natural Features: In all subdivisions due regard

to the approved plans and specifications, the designated natural areas may be
accepted by the Village Board. The developer shall guarantee the public
improvements against defective workmanship and/or materials for a period of two
(2) years from the date of acceptance. As a precondition to the acceptance of
the natural area improvements, the developer shall be required to deposit with
the Village an irrevocable letter of credit or an irrevocable letter of
commitment in substantially the form contained in Appendix II on file in the
Village Clerk's office, to provide financial security for the guarantee of the

of the cost of the original improvements, or two thousand dollars ($2,000.00),
whichever is greater. These funds shall be held by the Village, and shall be

6-3-10: DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC USE:
The purpose of this section is to provide additional open space for visual
pleasure and development of recreational areas for the benefit of village
residents.
   A.   Any proposed development of a land parcel equal to or less than five
(5) acres shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
   B.   The amount of land dedicated pursuant to this section shall be based
directly on the population density of the proposed development. The formula
shall be ten (10) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) population based on
population per dwelling unit. (Reference the table of estimated ultimate
population per dwelling unit published by Illinois School Consulting Service.)
   C.   Where the developer proposes to provide private recreational or open
space, the village board may, at its option, waive all or part of the required
public dedication. In general, a substitution of private for dedicated open
space will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement, in addition to
provisions for the permanence and maintenance thereof. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-
1999)
   D.   If, following recommendation of the plan commission/board of appeals,
the village board determines that on site land for the required dedication is
not available, or available land is not suitable or usable, then an amount of
money equal to two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) per acre for each of
the otherwise required acres shall be paid to the village to be held in a
separate village fund for the purpose of purchasing and/or maintaining or
improving land for recreational purposes in the village for the use of the
village residents. Provided, however, if the subdivider files a written
objection to the two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) per acre valuation,
he shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of improved land in
the area of his development. Final determination of the set fair market value
per acre of subject improved land shall be made by the village board of
trustees based upon the appraisal submitted by the subdivider and such other
information that has been submitted or is available to the village board. (Ord.
01-O-833, 7-2-2001; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)
   E.   The village board reserves the right to determine whether the land
dedication shall be to the village, a homeowners' association, another agency,
or a combination thereof.
   F.   The timing of the dedication shall be such that:
      1.   If land, dedication will coincide with the recording of the final
plat.
      2.   If cash contribution, fifty percent (50%) payable to the village at
the time the bond is posted for the public improvements, prior to commencement
of development; the balance shall be secured by a separate letter of credit and
payable at the time the certificate of occupancy is issued for the first unit,
or expiration of said letter of credit, whichever comes first. (Ord. 99-O-791,
6-7-1999)
6-3-11: RESERVATION OF PUBLIC SPACES AND SITES:
   A.   Plan For Public Land: Whenever a tract to be subdivided includes a
proposed street, highway or parkway, or proposed site for a park, playground,
school or other public use as indicated in the comprehensive plan map of the
village, such space shall be suitably incorporated by the developer into his
subdivision plat after proper determination of its necessity by the plan
commission/board of appeals and the appropriate village office or other public
agency involved in the acquisition and use of each such site. (Ord. 99-O-791,
6-7-1999; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)
   B.   Adequate Open Space Required:
      1.   Floodplain Areas: See title 5, chapter 11, and title 7, chapter 6,
of this code.
      2.   Park And Playground Sites: Unless appropriate provision for
dedication or donation of park or playground sites has been made by the village
board in a previous action, any required park or playgrounds shall be acquired
by the appropriate village, county or state agency.
   C.   Acquisition Of Land For Public Use: The acquisition of land which is
identified on the preliminary plan and which is to be served by a public agency
shall be initiated within twelve (12) months of the village board approval of
the preliminary plan. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate
acquisition within the prescribed twelve (12) months shall result in the
removal of the reserved designation from the property involved and the freeing
of the property for private development. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
      1.   Referral To Public Body: The plan commission/board of appeals shall
refer that plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its
consideration and report. The plan commission/board of appeals may propose
alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency
thirty (30) days for reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall
include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and
an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition.
      2.   Notice To Property Owner: Upon receipt of an affirmative report from
an acquiring agency, the plan commission/board of appeals shall notify the
property owner and shall designate on the preliminary plan that area proposed
to be acquired by the public body. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999; amd. Ord. 05-O-
942, 11-7-2005)
      3.   Duration Of Land Reservation: The acquisition of land reserved by a
public agency on the preliminary plan shall be initiated within twelve (12)
months of notification, in writing, from the owner that he intends to develop
the land. The twelve (12) month period shall commence from the date of approval
of the preliminary plan or the written notification, whichever is later.
Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the
prescribed twelve (12) months shall result in the removal of the "reserved"
designation from the property for private development. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-
1999)
      4.   Valuation Of Land: The value of such land shall be established by
three (3) qualified appraisers, one of whom shall be appointed by the plan
commission/board of appeals, one by the subdivider and one of whom shall be
mutually agreed upon by the other two (2). Should the village board decide to
acquire such premises, then and in that case, it shall make arrangements to pay
the subdivider thereof the appraised value or a sum that is mutually agreed
upon. The village board may accept any donation of land as above described,
should the subdivider desire to contribute the same to the village. (Ord. 99-O-
791, 6-7-1999; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)
6-3-12: DEDICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF DETENTION PONDS, FUNDS IN LIEU THEREOF:
   A.   Contribution Of And Development Of Detention Ponds Or Funds Required:
No final plat shall be approved until such time as the subdivider shall have
fully complied with the provisions of this title by either submitting detailed
plans and specifications for the development of storm water detention ponds on
the property to be subdivided, or shall agree to deposit funds for the
development of storm water detention ponds (as required by the development of
his subdivision) to be constructed off the site in an area designated by the
village.
   B.   Engineering Studies: The developer, at his expense, shall hire a
professional engineer, registered in the state, to prepare a detailed study of
the detention required by his subdivision. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
   C.   Location Of Detention Ponds: After the required storm water detention
has been determined, as specified in subsection A of this section, these
calculations shall be submitted to the village for review by the village
engineer. If the detention area required to serve the proposed subdivision is
more than one acre foot in size, the detention pond shall be constructed as
part of the subdivision improvements.
If recommended by the village engineer, in subdivisions where less than one
acre foot of detention is required, the developer shall pay to the village, in
lieu of construction of the detention facility, the equivalent of two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000.00) per acre foot. (Ord. 01-O-833, 7-2-2001)
   D.   Determination Of The Cost Of Off Site Detention Ponds: If it has been
determined (by the criteria specified in subsection C of this section) that the
detention pond is to be constructed off the site of the subdivision, the
developer, at his expense, shall have a professional engineer, registered in
the state, prepare an estimate of the cost to construct the detention pond off
the site, including the comparable cost of the land. The estimate shall be
submitted to the village for review by the village engineer.
Upon approval by the village, the funds in the amount of the approved estimate
shall be deposited with the village in lieu of the construction of the
detention pond on the site. Once deposited with the village, the funds shall
become the property of the village. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
6-3-13: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL LAND OR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of development, a final plat of
subdivision, or a final plat or special use permit for a planned unit
development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for
school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents and
children of the development, or make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land
dedication, or a combination of both at the option of the village, in
accordance with the following criteria and formula:
   A.   Criteria For School Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirements And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a
proposed development, subdivision or planned unit development shall bear
directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The
land dedication requirement shall be determined in accordance with the date for
the estimated number of children entering school per type of dwelling found in
the latest edition of the table prepared by the Illinois School Consulting
Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc., Naperville, Illinois.
School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be
determined in accordance with the following criteria based upon
"Recommendations for Elementary and High School Spaces", published by the
office of the superintendent of public instruction (now the state
superintendent of education), state of Illinois, Springfield, Illinois:
 
School Classification By Maximum Number  Of Minimum Number  Of Acres Of
Grades                   Students           Land
Elementary               600                11
Junior high              900                29
Senior high              1,500              45
 
      2.   Location: The comprehensive plan of the village, the comprehensive
school plan or facility utilization plan of the school district and the
standards adopted by the school district shall be considered in locating school
sites. The location of dedicated school sites shall be determined with the
input of the school district involved. A central location which will serve
equally the entire development is most desirable. Additional guidelines which
shall be considered in locating sites include, but are not limited to, size of
the subdivisions, proximity of the site to other schools and municipal
services, topography and shape of the site, accessibility of the site, safety
and the environmental and use conditions.
   B.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of School Land: Where the
subdivision or development is small and resulting school site is, in the
opinion of the village, too small to be practical or when the available land,
in the opinion of the village, after consultation with the affected school
district, is inappropriate for school purposes, the village shall require the
subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of a school land
dedication which contribution shall be paid to the village which shall then pay
said contributions over the school district and such contributions shall be
held in trust by the school district in which the development is located. Such
contributions shall be expended solely for the acquisition of land for school
sites and/or the types of improvements of school land, as set forth in
subsection B2 of this section, which land and/or improvements will be available
to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that development,
subdivision or planned unit development or for the improvement of other
existing local school land which already serves such needs. The village shall
have the right to request and receive from the affected school districts annual
audit reports and any other information the village may need from time to time
to ensure compliance with this section. If any portion of a cash contribution
in lieu of school land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth
herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, the school district (or
the village if applicable) holding the funds shall refund such contribution to
the owners of record of all lots, except lots dedicated pursuant to the
provisions of this section, in the development, subdivision, or planned unit
development for which such contribution was made. The refund shall be paid to
the persons who are the owners of record on the day which is the tenth
anniversary of the receipt of such contribution. The amount of the refund due
to each lot owner shall be equal to the amount of the original contribution,
together with such interest as may have been earned thereon, divided by the
total number of lots in the development, subdivision or planned unit
development (excluding only those lots which were dedicated pursuant to this
section) for which such contribution was made.
      1.   Acquisition Using Cash In Lieu Of School Land Donations:
         a.   The term "acquisition" as used in this section shall mean the
acquiring of land by purchase, condemnation or such other means as may be
appropriate.
         b.   The acquired land shall be used for the construction of new
facilities or shall support the types of improvements as set forth in
subsection B2 of this section.
      2.   Improvement Using Cash In Lieu Of School Land Donations: Where
existing school lands will serve the needs of the development, the cash
contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be used for the following types
of physical improvements: expansion of existing school facilities, additions to
existing facilities and, additions to school grounds and environment. (Ord. 99-
O-791, 6-7-1999)
      3.   Fair Market Value: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the sum of the fair market value of a vacant, unimproved and
unsubdivided acre of land in the village and the estimate of the village
engineer as to the cost of improving such land with electrical utilities,
water, sewer and streets, including enclosed drainage and curbs and gutters,
and all other improvements required under this title. All cash contribution
calculations shall be made by the village and the affected school districts
shall refer all developers to the village for such calculations. It has been
determined that the present fair market value of a vacant, unimproved and
unsubdivided acre of land in and surrounding the village is one hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($150,000.00) per acre, and the estimate of the village
engineer as to the cost of improvements is fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)
for a total of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00), and such figure of
two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) shall be used in making any
calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files objections thereto.
In the event of any objection, the developer shall, at his cost and by a Member
of Appraisal Institute (MAI), submit an appraisal showing the "fair market
value" of the land in the development or other evidence thereof and final
determination of said "fair market value" per acre of such vacant, unimproved
and unsubdivided land shall be made by the village board based upon such
information submitted, by the subdivider or developer and from the sources
which may be submitted to the village board by others. The village on its own
motion or at the request of others may from time to time amend this provision
to provide for different fair market values for parcels that are deemed by
others and the village to be of greater or lesser value. (Ord. 01-O-833, 7-2-
2001)
Cash contributions shall be paid at the time set forth in subsection H of this
section, provided, however, an owner, may on written request to the village
submitted at the time of application for approval of a final plat, pay one-half
(1/2) of the required contribution at the time of final plat approval with the
balance to be paid six (6) months after the date of final plat approval
provided the balance due is secured by an irrevocable letter of credit in a
form and from an issuer approved by the Village at the time of final plat
approval. If the developer so chooses to pay the required contribution in two
(2) installments, the amount of the second installment shall be based on the
then current price per acre of land and the Engineer's estimate of cost of
improvements as computed hereunder.
      4.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There may be situations
when both a land dedication and a cash contribution are necessary. These
occasions may arise, among others, when:
         a.   If it is determined by the Village that the land to be dedicated
for a school site within a development contains fewer acres than the amount
called for by this Section, a cash contribution shall be required for the
difference between the amount of land called for by this Section and the amount
of land which is actually to be dedicated.
         b.   If a major part of a local school site has already been acquired
and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the
site, the remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash
contribution for the difference is required.
   C.   Density Formula: The table of population density is generally
indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new
construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication
of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu of unless a written objection
is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer:
      1.   Objections To Density Formula: In the event a subdivider, developer
or school district involved files a written objection to the table of estimated
ultimate population and submits his own demographic study showing the estimated
additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit
development, a final determination of the density formula to be used in such
calculations shall be made by the Village Board based upon such demographic
information as the Village shall require. It is recognized that population
density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the
specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu
thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.
      2.   Presumed Density Formula: In applying the table of population
density to a subdivision for which the types of units and number of bedrooms
cannot reasonably be determined from the data on file with the Village at the
time the application for final plat approval is complete, the following types
of units and bedroom data shall be used unless written objection is filed
thereto by the subdivider, developer, or school district.
         Detached Single-Family: Four (4) bedroom unit per lot.
         Attached Single-Family: Equal mix of two (2) and three (3) bedroom
units at maximum unit density permitted by applicable zoning.
         Low Density Apartment: Equal mix of two (2) and three (3) bedroom
units at maximum unit density permitted by applicable zoning.
         High Density Apartment: Equal mix of one and two (2) bedroom units at
maximum unit density permitted by applicable zoning.
   D.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned
unit development is less than forty (40) acres, school space which is to be
dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining
developments in order to produce usable school sites without hardship on a
particular developer.
   E.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for school uses shall not differ greatly
from surrounding land.
   F.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated fully improved with
streets, water, sewer, enclosed drainage, curbs and gutter and in a condition
ready for full electrical and gas service, as applicable to the location of the
site, or acceptable provision made therefor.
   G.   Title To Sites: All sites to be dedicated shall be conveyed to the
Village either by warranty or trustee's deed, or such form of conveyance as the
Village shall require. The subdivider or developer shall be responsible for
conveying good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be responsible for
payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance, including any
agricultural rollback taxes which might be extended or levied against such
sites. In the discretion of the Village, a commitment for title insurance
issued by a company authorized to do business in Illinois may be required as
evidence of clear title. Conveyance shall occur only after or simultaneously
with the passage of a resolution by the school district in which the
development is located in which it indicates that the property will be accepted
by the school district for school purposes. Immediately thereafter, the village
shall convey such property to the appropriate regional board of school
trustees, or the trustees of schools, for the use and benefit of the
appropriate school district, whichever is applicable.
   H.   Time For Dedication Or Payment Of Fees In Lieu Thereof: The dedication
of school lands or payments of fees in lieu thereof shall be made by the owner
of land at the time of application for a building permit, except as otherwise
provided in subsection B3 of this section.
   I.   Expenditure Of Cash Contributions: Any school district which has a
school building located within the corporate limits of the village may receive
cash contributions hereunder, such contributions to be utilized in accordance
with subsection B2 of this section only at the school district's building to
which children residing in the village are assigned.
   J.   Indemnification: Except as otherwise provided below, the affected
school districts shall be required, as a condition of receiving the donations
hereunder, to indemnify and hold harmless the village from any loss, claims and
causes of actions of every kind incurred by the village as a result, either
directly or indirectly, of the passage of this section, or the administration
or enforcement thereof, including any so incurred as a result of a lawsuit
brought or threatened by the affected school districts. If the village is sued
by any subdivider or developer as result, directly or indirectly, of the
passage of this section, the village may, at its option, undertake the defense,
and all litigation costs, including attorney fees, shall be immediately
reimbursed by the affected school district. The village may withhold delivery
of any contribution to a school district pending compliance with these
indemnity provisions.
      1.   Where school districts improperly use funds or fail to use funds and
do not return same as specified in this section, the village may sue the
affected school district and shall be entitled to recover as a part of the
judgment therein, or any settlement thereof, all costs and expenses, including
attorney fees, incurred by the village.
      2.   Unless otherwise specifically provided, the above indemnification
provisions shall be an implied condition of every intergovernmental contract
entered into pursuant to this section.
   K.   Covenant Not To Sue: The affected school districts covenant and agree
not to sue the village for any claim arising, directly or indirectly, out of
the passage of this section, or the administration or enforcement thereof.
(Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
6-3-14: VACATION OF PLAT OF SUBDIVISION:
   A.   Any plat or any part of a plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
   B.   Such an instrument shall be approved by the village board in like
manner as plats of subdivisions. The village board may reject any such
instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its streets.
Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved, and recorded or
filed by the village, in the like manner as plats of subdivision; and being
duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the
recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described in such
plat. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
6-3-15: OTHER DIVISIONS OF LAND:
   A.   Description: A subdivision is described as a tract of land which is to
be, or has been, divided into two (2) or more lots or parcels, any of which is
five (5) acres, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of
ownership or building development, including all public streets, ways for
public service facilities, parks, playgrounds, school grounds, or other public
grounds, and all the tracts, parcels or lots and numbering of all such lots, or
parcels by progressive numbers giving their precise dimensions. The term
"subdivision" includes resubdivision and consolidation, and where it is
appropriate to the context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the
land subdivided. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
The plan commission/board of appeals may recommend granting a partial or entire
waiver of the applicability of the subdivision code provisions for any division
of property if the plan commission/board of appeals finds that the

village administrator and zoning administrator for the purpose of minimizing
the risk of objections to or rejection of the prepared plat of survey, and for
the purpose of ascertaining the problems and requirements affecting his
property. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999)
   C.   Procedure For Approval: The owner or subdivider shall file with the
village administrator ten (10) contact prints of a certified plat of survey
showing the proposed division of such lots, parcels or tracts of land. Ten (10)
prints of the plat of survey shall be forwarded to the plan commission/board of
appeals at least ten (10) days before the next meeting of the plan commission/
board of appeals.
The plan commission/board of appeals shall recommend to the village board,
approval, conditional approval, or rejection of the proposal. The village board
shall be notified in writing of any conditions of approval or the reason for
rejection. (Ord. 99-O-791, 6-7-1999; amd. Ord. 05-O-942, 11-7-2005)

7-4-2: MAILBOX DAMAGE:
Snow plowing of the streets by the Village is done for the public good and
mailboxes installed inside the public right of way are to be installed and
maintained in a fashion to absorb the impact of snow coming off the face of a
plow blade. Mailboxes are a homeowner's responsibility and deteriorated and
weakened mailboxes and posts are to be replaced prior to the start of winter.
   A.   Any mailbox or post damaged during Village snow removal operations
through direct contact or snow discharge as determined by the Chief Village
Officer, or his or her designee, shall be repaired, if practical, or
reparations for the damages given, but in no event will an amount exceeding two
hundred dollars ($200.00) be paid to the owner of the mailbox. Mailboxes shall
not be repaired in kind.
   B.   The Village shall not be responsible for any damage caused to any
private property located within the public right of way, including, but not
limited to, landscaping, "invisible fence" wiring, plants shrubs, trees,
lighting, sprinkler systems, hoses, plumbing or any other materials whatsoever,
regardless of the fashion in which the property is damaged (e.g., damage to
vegetation caused by the application of salt).
   C.   Snow plowing is a Village-wide operation performed under difficult
weather conditions and special snow removal operations to accommodate an
individual property owner's driveway or mailbox are not practical. Homeowners
are responsible for providing access to their mailbox and driveway during
winter conditions.

representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall
be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including,
without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area
and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights of way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.

days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section
7-9-21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-2007)

suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this

an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of
Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the village director of public works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village director
of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security
fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-
16-2007)
7-9-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:

permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:

practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

      1.   Except as provided in the following subsection, no utility shall
spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation
in the village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or
disease.
      2.   Spraying of any type of brush killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights of way unless the utility demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the director of public works that such spraying is the only practicable
method of vegetation control. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-2007)
7-9-18: REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES:
   A.   Notice: Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the
village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights of way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or
upon, the rights of way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights of way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights of way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights of
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights of way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within
ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the village director of
public works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not
direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice
of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to
consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by
another utility or person. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-2007)
7-9-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:

within rights of way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify noncompliance
with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right of way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
village director of public works or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete
repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the
traveling public.
   C.   Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the village a
description of the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight
(48) hours after an emergency repair. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-2007)

   A.   Request For Variance: A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the village director
of public works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The village director of public works
shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this
chapter identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The village director of public
works may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the village director of public works may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   E.   Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village
director of public works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the
right to appeal to the village board, or such other board or commission as it
may designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The village
board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-2007)
7-9-22: PENALTIES:
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 07-O-995, 10-16-
2007)
7-9-23: ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty
(30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed
approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days
of denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the Village's review period.
            The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application.
            Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the
deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not
apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different

an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents and information are specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.

         If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
         A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the
type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public
safety agency's communications equipment.
         Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing
unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licensed by a public safety agency.
         If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy
the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Certain Facilities And Poles Prohibited: The wireless provider shall
not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part
of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication
worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
         However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Code Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
         New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and
conditions set forth in the zoning regulations, including title 5 of this Code.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights- of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection B1d of this section; or
         c.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a person to collocate
small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately-owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this chapter.
   F.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village's
utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the
wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this
paragraph.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   H.   Abandonment; Sale Or Transfer:
      1.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The

wireless provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
      2.   Sale Or Transfer: A wireless provider shall provide written notice
to the Village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the
jurisdiction of the Village. Such notice shall include the name and contact
information of the new wireless provider. (Ord. 18-O-015, 7-17-2018)
7-11-4: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of Lake County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act.
Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
Village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal
utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 18-O-015, 7-17-2018)
7-11-5: INDEMNIFICATION:
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right- of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 18-O-015, 7-17-2018)
7-11-6: INSURANCE:
The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   A.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all

   C.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection
limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village improvements
or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self- insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 18-O-015, 7-17-2018)
7-11-7: APPEALS:
Any wireless provider aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including denial of or conditions established in connection with
a permit, variance, or other approval, made by the Village Engineer under the
provisions of this chapter may seek a review of such order, requirement,
decision or determination by filing a request for review thereof with the
Village Manager, within thirty (30) days after the notification of the order,
requirement, decision or determination. The request for review shall set forth

circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be

Removal of a Campsite in violation of this chapter may occur under the
following circumstances:
   A.   Prior to removing a Campsite, the Village shall post a notice, 24-hours
in advance of the removal, unless immediate removal of the Campsite is deemed
to be necessary for one of the reasons in subparagraphs 1-4, below. If such
immediate removal is undertaken, the basis for causing the immediate removal of
such Campsite should be adequately documented by the appropriate person(s).
      1.   immediate removal of the Campsite is necessary to maintain access to
a property;
      2.   immediate removal of the Campsite is necessary to maintain the
sanitary condition of a property;
      3.   immediate removal of the Campsite is necessary because the Campsite
is an obstruction to any public right-of-way; or,
      4.   immediate removal of the Campsite is necessary because the Campsite
poses a risk to the health and safety of the Village and its residents.
   B.   Upon any action pursuant to Section 8.A, above, the person causing such
action to be taken shall inform an appropriate agency delivering social
services to homeless individuals in the Village, of the location of the
Campsite and the person(s) found to be in violation of this chapter, so said
agency may determine whether or not it would be appropriate to offer its
services to the/those person(s).
   C.   If a 24-hour notice has been posted, and the 24-hour notice period has
passed, then the Campsite, as well as all Personal Property thereon, shall be
removed by the appropriate person(s) acting on behalf of the Village.
   D.   No portion of this Section shall be construed to prohibit any person
found to be engaging in Public Camping from removing their Personal Property
from the Campsite; however, such Personal Property that constitutes Exempt
Personal Property and which a reasonably prudent law enforcement officer,
exercising the applicable constitutional standard, would conclude that said
Exempt Personal Property constitutes items appearing to be stolen or otherwise
appearing to be evidence of a crime, and/or items which the person cannot
demonstrate the requisite lawful authority to possess, may be retained and
stored as evidence. (Ord. 24-O-020, 8-20-2024)
7-12-8: DISPOSITION AND RELEASE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: 
   A.   All Personal Property removed from any Campsite which is not Exempt

available for and released to an individual confirming ownership.
   B.   All Exempt Personal Property may be disposed of or retained as evidence
by the appropriate law enforcement agency of the Village. (Ord. 24-O-020, 8-20-

chapter within a rolling twenty-four (24) month period may be a monetary
penalty of $750 or incarceration for a period not exceeding the maximum time
allowed pursuant to Section 1-2-9 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-
2-9).
   G.   As a substitute for any monetary penalty assessed pursuant to
paragraphs A-F, above, and if consented to by the Village, the penalty assessed
to any person found in violation of this chapter may be that said person must
engage in public service by cleaning the rights-of-way and other public
facilities of the Village for an amount of time that, if the person found to
have violated this chapter was being paid the minimum wage under Illinois law,
the amount paid for that person’s labors would have been equal to the monetary
penalty assessed under this chapter.
   H.   The Village is hereby empowered to exercise all powers afforded to it,
at law or in equity, to collect any fines assessed against a person pursuant to
this chapter, including but not limited to seeking incarceration of said person
for a period of time that conforms with Section 1-2-9 of the Illinois Municipal
Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2-9).

approved by the Lake County Health Department.
      30.   Subsurface seepage fields or seepage pits shall not be constructed
in an area where the water is less than 4 feet below the trench or pit at all
times. Seasonal water table must be lowered to 2 feet below the seepage trench
by approved drainage.
      31.   Septic tanks and seepage fields shall be located at least 50 feet
from the shores of lakes or streams and at least 10 feet from an open ditch,
bank of stream, road cuts, edge of fill, farm tile or other clear water drains.
      32.   No in-ground swimming pool may be constructed within 20 feet of the
seepage field or reserve seepage field area.
      33.   Laundry wastes and other liquid basement wastes, except as noted,
must be discharged to the treatment system. Where it is necessary to pump such
wastes to the system, a separate leakproof sump and pump shall be provided for
such purpose exclusively.
      34.   Drainage from foundation footing drains, water softener, air
conditioner, humidifier, downspouts, and other clear waterdrains shall not be
discharged to the sewage disposal system or above the septic field area.

            (1)   Sewer shall be cast iron with mechanical or leaded joints.
            (2)   Sewer pipe with watertight joints.
Regulation D. Seepage Pits
Seepage pits are a less desirable method of disposal than an absorption field
and they shall only be used where there is no likelihood of contaminating
underground waters, where it is not possible to construct an absorption field,
and only when soil types are suitable for this use. The bottom of seepage pit
must be located at least 4 feet above the ground water table. The following are
the minimum requirements governing seepage pit construction:
      1.   Absorption area requirements are listed in Item C-27 of these Design
Specifications.
      2.   Soil Series 93, 323, 325, 327, 696, 698 and 706 can be used for
seepage pits if soil is sandy at 2 feet below the bottom of the proposed pit.
      3.   In determining the available absorption area per pit, the effective
absorption area of the seepage pit shall be the gross vertical wall area of
previous strata; the bottom area shall not be included.
      4.   Seepage pits shall be separated by a distance equal to 3 times the
diameter of the largest pit as measured between the near walls of adjacent
pits. The area of the lot shall be large enough to maintain this distance
between pits while still allowing room for additional pits if the original
design should prove inadequate.
      5.   Location: The location of seepage pits shall comply with the table
shown in Regulation C, Item 35.
      6.   Pit Construction: All seepage pits shall be lined with masonry,
unmortared below the inlet and mortared above, this lining shall be carried to
within 12 inches of the ground surface and capped with a reinforced concrete
cover designed for a dead load of 150 pounds per square foot and provided with
a manhole and watertight cover. On larger diameter pits the lining above the
inlet may be corbeled to reduce the size and span of the pit cover.
An annular space of approximately 6 inches shall be provided between the lining
and the pit wall; this space shall be filled with clean gravel or crushed stone
ranging in size from 1/2 inch to 2 1/2 inches.
Regulation E. Unsuitable Soils
When an application for on-site sewage disposal permit has been denied because
the soil on the lot is verified by the Health Officer as unsuitable for use for
subsurface seepage field, the Health Officer shall not issue a permit for the
construction of an individual sewage disposal system unless an individual plan
that provides for overcoming the limiting conditions, without violating any
local or County ordinance or regulation, or State law, has been submitted and
approved by the Department.
Regulation F. Privies
      1.   No new privy will be permitted for any premises having a domestic
water supply under pressure; where an existing privy on such premises fails or
requires replacement, it shall be replaced only by a water carriage system,
when such system can be expected to function satisfactorily, as determined by
the provisions of this Chapter.
      2.   Every privy shall be built, repaired and maintained to be in
accordance with the requirements of the Illinois State Department of Public
Health Private Sewage Disposal Licensing Act and Code 4.005, a copy of which
shall be on file in the office of the Lake County Health Department.
      3.   Every privy shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition and be
maintained insect and rodent proof.
Regulation G. Application for Permit
Before a septic system may be installed, an application, drawn to scale showing
all details of the system, must be submitted and approved by the Lake County
Health Department.

RULE II. SUBDIVISION SOIL TESTS
The adequacy of proposed subdivision sites utilizing individual soil absorption
sewage disposal systems shall be determined from the results of the soil type
that is identified by the required borings on the proposed lot. The soil type
shall be designated by the soil properties that most closely represent the
typical soil profile as described in the Lake County Soil Survey, the Illinois
Agricultural Experiment Station Soil Report No. 88. All soils must have a
minimum of 6 inches of permeable soil between the bottom of the trench and the
mottled subsoil, and also must be protected so that the seasonal high water
table will not rise closer than 2 feet below the bottom of the trenches.
Every lot served by an individual sewage disposal system shall have a suitable
area equivalent to 2 times the minimum requirement of the Lake County Health
Department as to soil type and type of development.
SECTION I
1.1 Number and Location of Test Holes: Sufficient borings to a minimum depth of
4 feet shall be made in the proposed field area. The number and location of
test holes shall be determined by the Lake County Health Department. The
borings shall be left open until inspected and evaluated by the Department.
1.2 Reporting of Results: The location of the boring shall be shown on the
engineering plat of subdivision. A detailed soil description showing the
different depth of each change of color and texture, as to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture textural classification, is required. This information is to be
furnished by a registered professional engineer, land surveyor, sanitarian
licensed to practice in Illinois, or a trained soil tester or soil scientist.
1.3 Suitable Lots: A minimum of 70% of the lots in any proposed subdivision or
unit of a proposed subdivision utilizing individual soil absorption sewage
disposal systems shall meet the requirements of this Chapter.
1.4 Unsuitable Lots: All unsuitable lots must be recorded on the final plat. If
more than 30% are unsuitable at the time of their evaluation, a sufficient
number of unsuitable lots must be upgraded so that 70% of the total lots are
suitable for individual sewage disposal installation. An engineering solution
must be submitted and approved for each of the remainder of the lots. This
information is to be furnished by a registered professional engineer licensed
to practice in Illinois.
TABLE II
LAKE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT
Division of Environmental Health
USE OF SOILS TO DETERMINE SUITABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION DETAILS FOR INSTALLING
SUBSURFACE SEEPAGE FIELDS
The Soil Survey, Lake County, Illinois, prepared by the Soil Conservation
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, provides detailed information about
the soils of Lake County. The table on the following pages is based on these
data and establishes the criteria to be used in determining the suitability of
specific soils for use and details for constructing and sizing subsurface
seepage fields. Field confirmation of soil type is required. It is possible
that the locations of the line on the soil map separating 2 differing types is
not precise and small areas of a differing soil type may exist within a larger
area shown on the map to be uniform.
Special Requirements. Special construction requirements are required in order
to overcome specific limitations or the slight difference in soil series.
Size of seepage field, square feet, bottom area of trench, is determined by the
controlled percolation rate and the number of bedrooms in the dwellings or the
average daily flow in other structures.
Maximum trench depths are specified for certain soils that are underlain with
dense clay or are subject to seasonal high water tables. The bottom of the
trench must be 6 inches above the slow permeable subsoil indicated by the
mottled coloring.
Curtain drains are required in certain soils when ground water seasonally rises
close to the surface. They are used to intercept the lateral movement of ground
water above the seepage field. Tile is installed about 3 feet deep, backfilled
close to the surface with gravel and discharges to a suitable lower point such
as a road ditch. The drain may not be closer than 10 feet to a seepage line and
the final 10 feet must be of one-piece construction.
Subsurface Drainage: Soils having seasonal high water table will be drained in
accordance with the "Drainage Guide for Illinois", U.S. Department of
Agriculture, AENG 881, or other recommended drainage standards.
Filling: Suitable fill may be placed on certain soils in order to level off a
low area or in order to raise the system a suitable height above the seasonal
high water table or slow permeable subsoil.
Unsuitable Soils: Soils with very severe limitations are unsuitable for use of
subsurface seepage fields under the existing conditions. Septic tanks and drain
fields will not be considered on these soils except on an individual basis
where an engineering plan that provides specific solutions for the limiting
conditions has been submitted.

Acts of vandalism resulting in damage to real or personal property within the
Village pose a threat to the value of property and the welfare of residents. It
is in the best interests of the Village that such acts be prosecuted by the
Village as a local offense; that penalties therefor be imposed which are
related to the nature of the act and the type of offender; and that the parents
or legal guardians of minors found guilty of such acts be held responsible for
any monetary penalty or order of restitution or reparation imposed. The
diligent pursuit of such interests will tend to increase parental supervision
of minors and reduce the incidence of juvenile vandalism, thus advancing the
welfare of residents of the Village. (Ord. 77-O-242, 2-3-1977)
9-2-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

reached nineteen (19) years of age.

corporation, company or organization of any kind.

directed by the court.
      2.   The conditions of conditional discharge may, in addition, require
that the defendant:
         a.   Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training;
         b.   Undergo medical or psychiatric treatment, or treatment for drug
addiction or alcoholism;

conditional discharge, the court shall determine the amount and conditions of
payment. When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court, at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period of conditional
discharge may impose an additional period of not more than two (2) years. Only
the conditions of payment shall continue to apply during such conditional
period. The court shall retain all of the incidents of the original sentence,

the burden of going forward with the evidence and proving the violation by the
preponderance of the evidence.

with conditions of a sentence which imposes financial obligations upon the
offender unless such failure is due to his wilful refusal to pay.
         e.   May modify the conditions of a conditional discharge on motion of
the Village or on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice
to all parties and a hearing.
      5.   If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at any
time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue the
offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the
conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time of
the initial penalty.
      6.   A judgment revoking probation or conditional discharge is a final
appealable order.

9-12-7: SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF BUS:
Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a violation of Chapter 9-
12 has occurred the Bus is subject to seizure and impoundment in addition to
any other monetary penalty or other remedy that may be pursued. The police
officer shall, in the exercise of discretion, provide for the towing of the Bus
to a facility approved by the Police Department. Any police officer shall have
the authority to refuse to allow any and all passengers from disembarking the
bus and shall escort the bus out of our corporate limits.
Upon the towing of a Bus, the police officer shall notify or make a reasonable
attempt to notify the owner of record, lessee, person claiming to be the owner
or lessee, or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle
owner' s right to request an administrative hearing.
(Ord. 24-O-002, 1-16-2024)
9-12-8: ADMINISTRATIVE TOW HEARING:
Within five (5) business days after a Bus is seized and impounded, the Village
shall notify, by personal service, first class mail, or certified mail, the
owner of record, lessee, and any lienholder of recorder of the owner's right to
request a hearing to determine whether a violation of this Chapter 9-12
actually occurred. The name and address of the person to whom a vehicle is
registered as shown on the records of the State in which the vehicle is
registered shall be conclusive evidence of the name and address of the owner of
record of the vehicle, unless the owner of record gave the Village actual
written notice of a different name or address.
In order to obtain a hearing, the owner of record must file a written request
for a hearing with the Village Clerk or the Police Department no later than ten
(10) business days after the date the notice was mailed. The hearing date must
be scheduled for a date that is no more than fifteen (15) business days after a
request for a hearing has been filed. The person requesting the hearing shall
be given at least five (5) business days' notice of the date of the hearing.
The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed in accordance
with this Code's Administrative Hearing Procedures. The owner of the Bus shall
have the right to be represented by an attorney; the right to notice of the
charges causing the seizure and impoundment of the Bus; the right to present
witness and documentary evidence; and the right to cross-examine all witnesses.
If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a preponderance of
evidence, that a violation of this Chapter 9-12 has occurred involving the
seized and impounded Bus, then the hearing officer shall enter an order finding
the owner of record of the vehicle liable to the Village for the administrative
fees of seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00), which shall be in addition
to any other penalties, fines and remedy sought. If, after a hearing, the
hearing officer does not determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the vehicle was used in violation of Chapter 9-12 of this Code, the hearing
officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and ordering the return of
the vehicle.
If the owner of record fails to request a hearing on the seizure and
impoundment of the Bus in a timely manner or fails to appear at the hearing,
the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived the owner' s right to a
hearing, and the hearing officer may enter a default order in favor of the
Village in the amount of the administrative fees. However, if the owner of
record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner, no default
order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her right to a hearing
and signs a written waiver, in which case, an order of liability shall be
deemed to have been made when the Village receives the written waiver.
(Ord. 24-O-002, 1-16-2024)
9-12-9: REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOVERY OF A SEIZED AND IMPOUNDED BUS:
A vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter shall remain impounded until:

paid to the Village and all applicable towing and impound fees are paid to the
towing agent, in which case, the owner of record shall be given possession of
the Bus; or
   B.   The Bus is deemed abandoned, in which case, it shall be disposed of in
the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles.
(Ord. 24-O-002, 1-16-2024)
9-12-10: POSTING FEE:
If a fee in the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) is posted with
the Police Department, the impounded Bus shall be released to the owner of
record, and the owner of the Bus shall still be liable to the towing agent for
any applicable towing fees. If, after an Administrative Hearing on the seizure
and impoundment of the Bus, it is determined that the Bus was used in violation
of Chapter 9-12 the posted fee shall be forfeited to the Village; however, if a
violation of Chapter 9-12 is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the
fee will be returned to the person posting the fee. All money posted pursuant
to this chapter shall be held by the Village until the hearing officer issues a
decision or, if there is a judicial review, until a final order is entered in
the judicial proceeding in which review is sought.
(Ord. 24-O-002, 1-16-2024)
9-12-11: DISPOSITION OF AN UNCLAIMED BUS:

10-8-3: SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT:
   A.   Whenever a police officer has cause to believe that a motor vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to section
10-8-2 of this chapter, the police officer may cause the vehicle to be towed to
a facility authorized by the municipality. A reasonable administrative fee not
to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be imposed by the village upon
the owner of record or the agents of the registered owner. For purposes of this
chapter, owner of record is the person or entity recorded with the Illinois
secretary of state as the vehicle owner or listed in the registry of motor
vehicles of another state. It is not necessary for criminal charges to be
filed, prosecuted or proven in order to seize and impound a motor vehicle
pursuant to this section. An administrative fee shall not be assessed if
verifiable proof is presented confirming that the motor vehicle was stolen at
the time the motor vehicle was impounded.
   B.   At the time the vehicle is towed, the municipality shall notify or make
a reasonable attempt to notify the owner or lessee, or person identifying
himself or herself as the owner or lessee of the vehicle, or any person who is
found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged offense, of
fact of seizure, and of the vehicle owner's or lessee's right to an
administrative hearing.
   C.   Any administration fee imposed shall be in addition to:
      1.   Any other penalties that may be assessed by a court of law for the
underlying violations; and
      2.   Any towing or storage fees, or both, charged by the towing company.
   D.   The administrative fee assessed shall be uniform for all similarly
situated motor vehicles.
   E.   The fees shall be collected by and paid to the municipality imposing
the fees.
   F.   The towing and storage fees, or both, shall be collected by and paid to
the person, firm, or entity that tows and stores the impounded vehicle.
   G.   The municipality shall also provide notice that the motor vehicle will
remain impounded pending the completion of an administrative hearing, unless
the owner or lessee of the vehicle or lienholder posts with the municipality a
bond equal to the administrative fee as provided by ordinance and pays for all
towing and storage charges. (Ord. 12-O-002, 2-20-2012)
10-8-4: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
   A.   Within ten (10) business days after a vehicle is seized and impounded
pursuant to this chapter, the village shall notify, personally or by certified
mail, the owner, lessee, and any lienholder of record of the owner's right to
request a hearing to challenge whether a violation of this chapter has
occurred. The owner of record seeking a hearing must file a written request for
a hearing with the village administrator or designee no later than ten (10)
business days after notice was issued. The hearing date must be no more than
forty five (45) business days after the date of the notice of hearing and shall
be conducted pursuant to the administrative hearing procedures set forth in
title 1, chapter 26 of this code. (Ord. 12-O-002, 2-20-2012)
   B.   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. In a hearing on the propriety
of impoundment of a vehicle any sworn or affirmed report, citation or ticket
that: 1) is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement officer's duties
and 2) sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to the impoundment,
shall be admissible evidence of the vehicle owner's liability, unless rebutted
by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
   C.   If, after the hearing, the administrative hearing officer determines by
a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of this
chapter, the administrative hearing officer shall then enter an order finding
the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for the
administrative penalty.
   D.   If, after a hearing, the administrative hearing officer does not
determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such
a violation, the administrative hearing officer shall enter an order finding
for the owner and for the return of the vehicle.
   E.   If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails to appear at the
hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record
shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the
administrative hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the
village in the amount of the administrative penalty.
   F.   If the owner pays the administrative penalty and the vehicle is
returned to the owner, no default order needs to be entered if the owner is
informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which
case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made when the village
receives the written waiver. (Ord. 08-O-1027, 11-3-2008)
10-8-5: DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES:
   A.   An administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a debt due and owed the village. A vehicle impounded pursuant to
this chapter shall remain impounded until:
      1.   The administrative penalty as set forth herein is paid to the
village and all applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing
agent, in which case the owner of record shall be given possession of the
vehicle; or
      2.   A bond in the amount of the administrative penalty is posted with
the police department and all applicable towing and storage fees are paid to
the towing agent, at which time the vehicle will be released to the owner of
record; or
      3.   The vehicle is deemed abandoned, in which case the vehicle shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned
vehicles. (Ord. 08-O-1027, 11-3-2008)
10-8-6: POSTING OF BOND:
   A.   If a bond is posted with the police department, the impounded vehicle
shall be released to the owner of record. The owner of the vehicle shall still
be liable to the towing agent for any applicable towing and storage fees.
   B.   If an administrative penalty is imposed for violation of this chapter,
the bond will be forfeited to the village; however, if a violation of this
chapter is not proven by the preponderance of the evidence, the bond will be
returned to the person posting the bond.
   C.   All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the
village until the administrative hearing officer issues a decision, a hearing
has been waived, or, upon entry of a decision by the circuit court, if judicial
review has been requested.
   D.   The bond posted will be in the form of cash. Credit cards, personal
checks, business checks or traveler's checks will not be accepted. (Ord. 08-O-
1027, 11-3-2008)
10-8-7: VEHICLE POSSESSION:
Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within thirty five (35) days after the
expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the village's action under this chapter, or the time at which a final
judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time a final
administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in
default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed or abandoned vehicle as provided by
law, provided, however, that where proceedings have been instituted under state
or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may not be disposed
of by the village except as consistent with those proceedings. (Ord. 12-O-002,
2-20-2012)
