PARK AND RECREATION BOARD
§ 32.25  PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to use existing public and private
resources and combine them into a coordinated park and recreation program for
the use and benefit of the residents of the city.  The city realizes there is
growing demand for recreational facilities and programs, but it is also aware
that the present financial and human resources available through the city
system are limited.  Therefore, until the time as the city’s own resources are
expanded and improved, the system of delivery of park and recreation programs
set out in §§
32.26 and
32.27 is hereby established to provide city residents with what is hopefully an
adequate and effective system.

organizations may each submit the name of 1 nominee, who must be a resident of
the city, to the Mayor prior to the second City Council meeting in April of
each year.  (All members’ terms shall begin and expire on the general dates
established for appointed city officials on other boards and committees.)  All
members shall have equal voting power.  A chairperson shall be elected from the
members and shall serve for a 1-year term.  No member may act as chairperson
for more than two  consecutive years.  Other offices may be established by the
Board as they require or deem appropriate and necessary.
   (C)   Recognized private recreational organizations.  The City Council may,
after a review and affirmative recommendation by the Board of the petition of a
private recreational organization, recognize the organization as a deliverer of
a specific recreational program.  Recognition shall be formally approved by a

injury incurred in the line of duty to his or her department head and take such
first aid treatment as may be necessary, may be declared ineligible for

reasonably anticipates illness, disability or convalescence for more than 10
working days will apply to the Council for an unpaid medical leave of absence.
Applications will be filed at least 2 weeks prior to the requested leave. The

reason and approximate time needed for leave, and will accompany the
application with a statement from the attending physician. In case of emergency
or incapacitation of the employee, the Council will waive these requirements.
The Council may, in its sole discretion, allow or deny the request for medical
leave; no employee is entitled to medical leave.
   (D)   Bereavement leave.  A maximum of 3 days leave may be taken by an

employee will present his or her orders in advance of taking leave, and will
report back to work within 10 business days after return from active duty.
Military leave will not be granted to an employee who voluntarily joins the
active Armed Services of the United States in a national emergency.
   (F)   Jury leave.  An employee called for jury duty will be given leave to
attend jury duty. The employee, upon receiving a summons, will immediately

compensation paid by the court.

      (1)   A pregnant employee is entitled to an unpaid maternity leave of
absence. An employee who becomes pregnant will notify her department head (or,
if the employee is a department head, her committee chairperson) of her
condition by the beginning of the fifth month of the pregnancy and submit to
her department head a written statement from her personal physician specifying
the estimated delivery date and the estimated date that the employee should
cease working. From time to time, the employee will provide written statements
from her personal physician if the initial estimated dates change. The
department head will forward all such statements to the Council.
      (2)   A maternity leave of absence will commence when the employee's
physician certifies that she is no longer able to perform work safely and
efficiently. Maternity leave will continue until such time as the employee's
physician certifies that the employee is able to return to work, but not later
than 10 weeks after commencement of maternity leave, or 8 weeks after the birth

contact City Hall and report her return to work plans within 30 days of the
birth of her child.

chairperson will forward the request, with recommendations, to the Council. The
Council, in its sole discretion, may approve or disapprove the extension or
approve the extension in part.
      (4)   An employee who returns to work at the conclusion of maternity
leave will be restored to her former position or to a comparable position at
the same rate of pay unless circumstances have changed or made it impossible or
unreasonable to reinstate the employee.
      (5)   A pregnant employee may, consecutively with her unpaid maternity
leave, take any accrued sick days or her then allowable vacation days.

§ 37.065  OTHER BENEFITS.
   (A)   Medical benefits.
      (1)   The city provides a full-time employee and his or her dependents
with medical insurance as set forth in the governing medical insurance policy
at a cost to be determined from time to time by the Council. Under the city's
medical insurance policy, medical benefits are available on the first day of
the employee's employment. Employees terminating employment with the city are
entitled to participate in the city's medical insurance program at their own
cost as set forth in the city's governing medical insurance policy, and by the
COBRA laws. The city's medical insurance program is subject to change without
notice.
      (2)   Life and disability insurance will be provided by the city for the
employee, after the employee has been employed for 90 days.
      (3)   The city will continue to pay the city portion of the premium for

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
§ 37.070  POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   Prohibition on sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass a person
because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment
is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of
1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment
free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which
affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of
the City of Villa Grove to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
   (B)   Definition of sexual harassment.
      (1)   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in
the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines SEXUAL HARASSMENT as any
unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
         (b)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
         (c)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
         (a)   Verbal. Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor,
and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions,
threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even
outside of their presence, of a sexual nature.
         (b)   Non-verbal. Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering,
obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls," "smacking"
or "kissing" noises.
         (c)   Visual. Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
         (d)   Physical. Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching,
brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
         (e)   Textual/electronic. "Sexting" (electronically sending messages
with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and
Twitter).
      (3)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person."
   (C)   Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment.
      (1)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes
herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the
incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his
position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not
necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
      (2)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
         (a)   Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
         (b)   Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the City Manager or
Administrator, or the Chief Executive Officer of the municipality.
         (c)   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
         (d)   Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is
to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
      (3)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report
(what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
      (4)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
   (D)   Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment
allegations.
      (1)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee's:
         (a)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy;
         (b)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy; or
         (c)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
      (2)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
      (3)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
      (4)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein,
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (ILCS Chapter 5, Act 430, § 15-10)
provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs
in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
         (a)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a
public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state
agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is
in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
         (b)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state
employee; or
         (c)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
      (5)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (ILCS Chapter 740, Act 174, § 15
(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses
information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative
commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has
reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a
state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not
retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law
enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. (ILCS Chapter 740, Act 174, § 15(b)).
      (6)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (ILCS Chapter 775, Act
5, § 6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for 2 or more
people to conspire to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed
that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment
in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified,
assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the
Illinois Human Rights Act.
      (7)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge, either due within 300 days of the alleged
retaliation.
   (E)   Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment.
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in ILCS Chapter 5, Act 430, § 5-65,
may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 per offense, applicable discipline or
discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties
established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each
violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the
municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an
ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency.
   (F)   Consequences for knowingly making a false report.
      (1)   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser
using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping
sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false
report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is
a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
      (2)   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report
alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees
Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official
is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to $5,000 against any person who intentionally makes
a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

to the Council.
(Ord. 062402A, passed 6-24-2002; Am. Ord. 2005-MC12, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 37.091  VERBAL WARNING.
   One method of disciplinary action is a verbal warning by the employee's
department head or committee chairperson. The department head or committee
chairperson will document such verbal warning as to date, time, place, who is
present, the reason for the verbal warning and the substance of the verbal

§ 37.093  SUSPENSION WITHOUT PAY.
   (A)   Suspension without pay is another method of disciplinary action, to be
used only for serious infractions or where the employee has not rectified
deficiencies noted in verbal or written warnings. However, neither a verbal
warning nor a written warning is a condition precedent for a suspension. The
authority to suspend for 24 hours is vested in the department head with
immediate notification to the committee chairperson (or Mayor or other Council
member). Suspension by a department head is limited to incidents of employee
insubordination or malicious bodily contact. The authority to suspend for 24
hours may also be exercised by the Mayor or committee chairperson, with
immediate notification to the Council.
   (B)   Suspension without pay are limited to 10 working days for any
infraction. The authority to suspend for 10 days must be with Council approval,
subject to hearing rights set forth in §

§ 37.094  DISMISSAL.

§ 37.095  DEMOTIONS.
   Demotions are, strictly speaking, not a disciplinary action, but the Council
may demote any employee whose work in his or her job has not been satisfactory,
but who, in the opinion of the Council, can satisfactorily perform less
difficult work.
(Ord. 062402A, passed 6-24-2002; Am. Ord. 2005-MC12, passed 10-24-2005)

but not limited to, taxes and utility bills.
   (M)   Habitual discourtesy or disrespect to the public or to fellow

§ 37.097  HEARING RIGHTS.
   Any full or part-time non-probationary employee will have the right to a
hearing and appeal of the disciplinary action, as follows:
   (A)   Verbal and written warnings may be appealed by presentation of a
grievance in writing to the employee's department head (or, in the case of
discipline of a department head, to the committee chairperson) who, if
possible, will resolve the grievance. If the aggrieved employee is not
satisfied with the disposition of the written or verbal warning, the employee
will submit his or her case in writing to the City Council within 5 working
days. The City Council will require in writing the action taken and
justification therefore against the aggrieved employee. The City Council may
conduct a hearing allowing witnesses for both or either side to testify, or it
may call witnesses of its own, before deciding on the issue. The Council will
render its decision within 10 days of the receipt of the appeal of the
aggrieved employee and advise the aggrieved employee of its decision in
writing; the decision will be placed in the personnel file if the verbal or
written warning is sustained. The verbal or written warning will be removed
from the personnel file if the verbal or written warning is overruled by the
City Council.
   (B)   In cases of suspension, the employee is entitled to a hearing before
the Council. The hearing will be pre-suspension unless in the judgment of the
committee chairperson, department head, or in the absence of the committee
chairperson, the Mayor, circumstances require immediate suspension and a post-
suspension hearing. At the hearing, the employee may present witnesses, may be
represented by counsel, and may, at the employee's own expense, have a court
reporter present. The notice of hearing will explain these rights and identify
any complainants. The Mayor will preside at any such hearing, and the City
Attorney will be present to advise the Council. After such hearing, the Council
may elect to affirm the suspension without pay, shorten or lengthen the
suspension without pay, or if it determines in a post-suspension hearing that
the suspension was improper, terminate the suspension and award back pay.
   (C)   Any employee faced with discharge is entitled to a statement of
reasons for the discharge and a pre-discharge hearing, which will be held by
the Council in the same manner as a suspension hearing and as to which the
employee has the same rights as in a suspension hearing. The pre-discharge
hearing will, in the case of an employee suspended without pay pending
discharge, be held in conjunction with the post-suspension hearing.
   (D)   The Council will make its decison in a suspension or pre-discharge
hearing by majority vote of those present. The Mayor is entitled to vote at
such hearing and will be counted in determining the decision.
   (E)   In addition to the rights set forth in this section, police officers
are entitled to rights set forth in the Uniform Peace Officers' Disciplinary
Act, ILCS, Chapter 85, §§ 2551, et seq.

§ 37.098  PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS.
   (A)   If the Mayor believes that an employee of the city is not performing
consistent with the efficient performance of city business or needs improvement
in some areas of service to the community, the Mayor may institute a
performance improvement plan. These performance improvement plans shall include
specific goals for improvement and shall provide a specific time period within
which improvement is expected. Additional evaluations may be completed during
the course of the performance improvement plan. Failure to meet the goals of
the performance improvement plan may result in a reduction in duties, hours
and/or pay. Failure to meet the goals established may also result in
termination of employment.
   (B)   Terminations for poor performance under this section are not
considered disciplinary action and do not grant any of the hearing rights
provided in §
37.097 for employees appealing disciplinary actions.
(Ord. 2014-MC07, passed 6-23-2014)
TERMINATIONS
§ 37.100  RESIGNATIONS.

employee's supervisor, who, in turn, will notify the City Council. The Council
will determine the proper termination pay and see to it that any city property
is either returned or charged as a deduction from termination pay.

§ 37.101  LAYOFFS.
   When it is necessary in the judgment of the Council to reduce the number of
employees on the city payroll or on the payroll of any department, the Council
may lay off employees in its sole discretion. An employee thus separated is
eligible for re- employment and, if re-employed, will retain seniority rights
as of the date of separation for purposes of this section.
(Ord. 062402A, passed 6-24-2002; Am. Ord. 2005-MC12, passed 10-24-2005)
§ 37.102  RETURN OF CITY PROPERTY.
   An employee leaving the city's service, whether through resignation, layoff
or dismissal, will return any property of the city which the employee has in
his or her possession. The property must be returned to the employee's
supervisor, before the employee receives his or her final check.

IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
§ 39.01  OBJECTIVE.
   (A)   The purpose of this Identity Theft Prevention Program (herein referred
to as “Program”) is to protect customers of the city's utility services from
identity theft.
   (B)   The Program is intended to establish reasonable policies and
procedures to facilitate the detection, prevention and mitigation of identity
theft in connection with opening new covered accounts and activity on existing
covered accounts. 
(Ord. 2008-MC08, passed 10-27-2008)
§ 39.02  SCOPE.
   (A)   This Program applies to the creation, modification and access to
identifying information of a customer of 1 or more of the utilities operated by
the municipality (water and sewer) by any and all personnel of the
municipality, including management personnel.
   (B)   This Program does not replace or repeal any previously existing
policies or programs addressing some or all of the activities that are the
subject of this Program, but rather it is intended to supplement any such
existing policies and programs.
(Ord. 2008-MC08, passed 10-27-2008)
§ 39.03  DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this Program, each of the following terms have the meaning set
forth opposite its name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be
given a different meaning: 
   COVERED ACCOUNT.  An account that the city offers or maintains, primarily
for personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to
permit multiple payments of transactions  (16 C.F.R. § 681.2(b)(3)(i)).  A
utility account is a “covered account.”  The term COVERED ACCOUNT also includes
other accounts offered or maintained by the municipality for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the municipality or its customers from identity
theft (16 C.F.R. 681.2(b)(3)(ii)). 
   IDENTITY THEFT.  A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (16 C.F.R. § 681.2(b)(8) and 16
C.F.R. § 603.2(a)).
   IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.  Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, Social Security number, date of birth, official state- or
government-issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or  taxpayer identification
number.  Additional examples of “identifying information” are set forth in 16
C.F.R. § 603.2(a). 
   RED FLAG.  A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the Federal Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules (16 C.F.R.
pt. 681) or the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.),
as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, enacted
into law on December 4, 2003 (Public Law 108-159). 
(Ord. 2008-MC08, passed 10-27-2008)
§ 39.04  POLICY.
   (A)   Administration of the Program.  Issues to be addressed in the annual
Identity Theft Prevention Report include:
      (1)   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with opening new covered accounts and
activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
      (2)   Service provider arrangements.
      (3)   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's
response.
      (4)   Recommendations for material changes to the Program, if needed for
improvement.
   (B)   Identity theft prevention elements.
      (1)   Identification of relevant red flags.  The city has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the Federal
Trade Commission's Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the municipality's
past history with instances of identity theft, if any.  The municipality hereby
determines that the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this
Program, given the relative size of the municipality and the limited nature and
scope of the services that it provides to its citizens:
         (a)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers.
            1.   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer
report or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
            2.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze
in response to a request for a consumer report.
            3.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in § 681.1(b) of the Federal Trade Commission's
Identity Theft Rules.
            4.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
               a.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of
inquiries;
               b.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
               c.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
               d.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for
abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
         (b)   The presentation of suspicious documents.
            1.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been
altered or forged.
            2.   The photograph or physical description on the identification
is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting
the identification.
            3.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
            4.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
            5.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or
gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
         (c)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
            1.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For
example:
               a.   The address does not match any address in the consumer
report or CRA ID Check response; or
               b.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
            2.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer.  For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range
and date of birth.
            3.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity, as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the municipality. For example:
               a.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
               b.   The phone number on an application is the same as the
number provided on a fraudulent application.
            4.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type
commonly associated with fraudulent activity, as indicated by internal or
third-party sources used by the municipality.  For example:
               a.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop or a prison; or
               b.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager
or answering service.
            5.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other
persons opening an account or other customers.

         (a)   City employees that interact directly with customers on a day-
to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility of monitoring the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider in connection with  opening new accounts, modifying or
accessing existing accounts, and detecting any red flags that might arise.
            1.   Management shall see to it that all employees who might be
called upon to assist a customer with opening a new account, or with modifying
or otherwise accessing an existing account, are properly trained so that they
have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in this
Program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction.
            2.   An employee who is not sufficiently trained to recognize the
red flags identified in this Program shall not open a new account for any
customer, modify any existing account, or otherwise provide any customer with
access to information in an existing account without the direct supervision and
specific approval of a management employee.
            3.   Management employees shall be properly trained so that they
can recognize the relevant red flags identified in this Program, and exercise
sound judgment in connection with the response to any unresolved red flags that
may present themselves in connection with opening a new account, or with
modifying or accessing an existing account.
            4.   Management employees shall be responsible for making the final
decision on any such unresolved Red Flags.
         (b)   The Program Administrator shall establish, from time to time, a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may

with the application in verifying the customer's identity, and  the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. 
            1.   Such policy shall be generally consistent with the spirit of
the Customer Identification Program rules (31 C.F.R. § 103.121) implementing §
326(a) of the U.S. Patriot Act, but need not be as detailed. 
            2.   The Program Administrator shall establish, from time to time,
a written policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing
accounts shall establish their identity before being allowed to make
modifications to or otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
      (3)   Response to detected red flags.
         (a)   If the responsible city employees, as set forth in division (B)
(2) above, are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a reasonable
belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to open a new
account or to modify or otherwise access an existing account, based on the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the municipality shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be. 
         (b)   Discrimination by city employees with respect to opening new
accounts or modifying or accessing existing accounts will not be tolerated, and
shall be grounds for immediate dismissal. 
         (c)   The Program Administrator shall establish, from time to time, a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation.
            1.   Consideration should be given to aggravating factors that may
heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security incident that
results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a notice that a
customer has provided account information to a fraudulent individual or
website. 
            2.   Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity theft
when a red flag is detected include:
               a.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity
theft.
               b.   Contacting the customer.
               c.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security
devices that permit access to a covered account.

particular circumstances.

devices are erected or in place.
   (D)   Whenever any official traffic-control device is placed or held in
position approximately conforming to the requirements of this traffic code, the
device shall be presumed to have been so placed or held by the official act or

no signal light facing the vehicle is illuminated shall stop before entering
the intersection, in accordance with rules applicable in making a stop at a
stop sign.
   (F)   Any violation of division (A) that occurs within a designated highway
construction zone or maintenance zone shall result in a fine of no less than
$100 and no more than $1,000.
(ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-305)
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.31  TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively 1 at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at the place prohibits the
turn.  Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield
the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or the other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time.  The vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   (1)   Steady yellow indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow
arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being
terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in
§
70.32, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway
before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
      (2)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow arrow indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.32, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk
that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic
controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no the stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk,
then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing until an
indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no crosswalk,
then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing until an
indication permitting the movement indicated by the red arrow is shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the village
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a
one- way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of
this section.  After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways.  The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   After stopping as required by divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) above,
the driver or a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails
to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than
120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to
detect the arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s size or
weight, shall have the right to proceed, after yielding the right of way to
oncoming traffic facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after
making a stop at a stop sign required by ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-204.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall
not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application.  Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
the sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
(ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-306) 
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.32  PEDESTRIAN-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “Walk” or
“Don’t Walk” or the illuminated symbols of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, these signals shall indicate as follows.
   (A)   “Walk” or walking person symbol.  Pedestrians facing this signal may
proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   “Don’t Walk” or upraised palm signal.  No pedestrian shall start to
cross the roadway in the direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has
partly completed his or her crossing on the “Walk” signal or upraised palm
symbol shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the “Don’t Walk”
signal or upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady, or flashing.
(ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-307) 
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.33  LANE-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever lane-control signals are used in conjunction with official signs,
they shall have the following meanings.
   (A)   Downward-pointing green arrow.  A driver facing this indication is
permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal is located. 
Otherwise, he or she shall obey all other traffic controls present and follow
normal safe driving practices.
   (B)   Red X symbol.  A driver facing this indication shall not drive in the
lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify
accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present.  Otherwise he or
she shall obey all other traffic controls and follow normal safe driving
practices.
   (C)   Yellow X (steady).  A driver facing this indication should prepare to
vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner to avoid, if
possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.
   (D)   Flashing yellow arrow.  A driver facing this indication may use the
lane only for the purpose of approaching and making a left turn.
(ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-308) 
Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.34  FLASHING SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in conjunction
with a traffic-control device, it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic
as follows.
   (A)   Flashing red (stop signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past the signal only with caution.
   (C)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.

SPEED RESTRICTIONS
§ 71.001  SPEED LIMITS.
   (A)   No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this city at a speed
which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any
person or property.  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the
applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching
and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions.
Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person
or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and
the duty of all persons to use due care.
   (B)   No person may drive a vehicle upon any street at a speed which is
greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by
divisions (C) and (D) below, by §
71.002, or by a regulation or ordinance made under this chapter.
   (C)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in an urban district (as defined in §
70.01) for all vehicles is:
      (1)   Thirty miles per hour; and
      (2)   Fifteen miles per hour in an alley.
   (D)   Unless some other speed restriction is established under this chapter,
the maximum speed limit in a non-urban district shall be as determined under
ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-601.
   (E)   A first violation of this section is a petty offense with a minimum
fine of $150.  A second or subsequent violation of this section is a petty
offense with a minimum fine of $300.
(ILCS Chapter 625, Act 5, § 11-601) 
Penalty, see § 71.999
Statutory reference:
   Authority to regulate speed, see ILCS Chapter 65, Act 5, § 11-40-1 and

§ 71.002  SPECIAL SPEED LIMITS WHILE PASSING SCHOOLS AND WHILE TRAVELING
THROUGH HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE ZONES.
   (A)   School zones.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, a SCHOOL DAY shall begins at 6:30
a.m. and concludes at 4:00 p.m.
      (2)   On a school day when school children are present and so close
thereto that a potential hazard exists because of the close proximity of the
motorized traffic, no person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess
of 20 miles per hour while passing a school zone, or while traveling on a
roadway on public school property or upon any public thoroughfare where
children pass going to and from school.
      (3)   This section shall not be applicable unless appropriate signs are
posted upon streets wherein the school zone is located.  With regard to the
special speed limit while passing schools, the signs shall give proper due
warning that a school zone is being approached, and shall indicate the school
zone and the maximum speed limit in effect during school days when school
children are present.
      (4)   A first violation of this section is a petty offense with a minimum
fine of $150.  A second or subsequent violation of this section is a petty
offense with a minimum fine of $300.
      (5)   When a fine for a violation of this section is $150 or greater, the
person who violates the section shall be charged an additional $50 to be paid
to the unit school district where the violation occurred for school safety
purposes.  If the violation occurred in a dual school district, $25 of the
surcharge shall be paid to the elementary school district for school safety
purposes and $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to the high school district for
school safety purposes.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the entire
$50 surcharge shall be paid to the appropriate school district or districts.
      (6)   When a fine for a violation of division (A)(2) is $150 or greater,
the person who violates division (A)(2) shall be charged an additional $50 to
be paid to the unit school district where the violation occurred for school
safety purposes. If the violation occurred in a dual school district, $25 of
the surcharge shall be paid to the elementary school district for school safety
purposes and $25 of the surcharge shall be paid to the high school district for
school safety purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the entire

   (C)   Use of electronic surveillance.  Nothing in this chapter shall
prohibit the use of electronic speed- detecting devices within 500 feet of
signs within a special school speed zone or a construction or maintenance zone
indicating the zone, as defined in this section, nor shall evidence obtained
thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding, provided the use of
the device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in the
special school speed zone or a construction or maintenance zone.
   (D)   (1)   (a)   Definition.  For the purpose of this section, a
CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE SPEED ZONE is an area in which the Department, Toll
Highway Authority, or a local agency has posted signage advising drivers that a
construction or maintenance speed zone is being approached, or in which the
Department, Authority, or local agency has posted a lower speed limit with a
highway construction or maintenance speed zone special speed limit sign after
determining that the preexisting established speed limit through a highway or

Penalty, see § 71.999
SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.080  OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must
exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a
highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in
this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet
from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not proceed until the tracks
are clear and he or she can do so safely.  The foregoing requirements shall
apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagger gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and the train or railroad track equipment, by
reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment is approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.  Whenever a person driving a
vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always
required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care and
caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of
danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this section, the driver
shall slow down within 50 feet but not less that 15 feet from the nearest rail
of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that the tracks
are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.
   (B)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around, or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (C)   When stop signs are erected at railroad grade crossings, the driver of
any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the
nearest rail of the railroad, and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way.
   (E)   No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to
negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient
undercarriage clearance.
   (F)   It is unlawful to violate any part of this section.
      (1)   A violation of this section is a petty offense for which a fine of
$500 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $1,000 shall be
imposed for a second or subsequent violation.  The court may impose 25 hours of
community service in place of the  $500 fine for the first violation.
      (2)   For a second or subsequent violation, the Secretary of State may
suspend the driving privileges of the offender for a minimum of 6 months.

gears during the crossing, and the driver shall not shift gears while crossing
the track or tracks.
   (B)   This section shall not apply:
      (1)   At any railroad grade crossing where traffic is controlled by a
police officer or a human flagger;
      (2)   At any railroad grade crossing controlled by a functioning traffic-
control signal transmitting a green indication which, under law, permits the
vehicle to proceed across the railroad tracks without slowing or stopping,
except that division (A) of this section shall apply to any school bus;
      (3)   At any streetcar grade crossing within a business or residence
district; or

of division (B) of this section or a similar provision of a local ordinance;
the Secretary shall suspend for a period of 3 months the driving privileges of
any person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of division (B) of

grant, for the duration of any suspension issued under this subsection, a
restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle

limits that the Secretary of State shall find necessary to avoid any undue
hardship.  A restricted driving permit issued hereunder shall be subject to
cancellation, revocation and suspension by the Secretary of State in like
manner and for like cause as a driver's license may be cancelled, revoked or

ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause
for the revocation, suspension or cancellation of the restricted driving
permit.  The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a
restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated
driver remedial or rehabilitative program.  Any conviction for a violation of

shall be subject to seizure and impoundment as provided in this section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, a motor vehicle is not considered to

      (1)   The motor vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and
the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered;
      (2)   The motor vehicle was operating as a common carrier and the
violation occurred without the knowledge of the person in control of the motor
vehicle; or
      (3)   The alleged owner of record provides adequate proof that the motor
vehicle had been sold to another person prior to the violation.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.03  SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT.
   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle
is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to § 79.02, such police officer
shall provide for the towing of such motor vehicle to a facility designated by
the city.  Before or at the time the motor vehicle is towed, the police officer
shall notify the owner of record or the person in control of the motor vehicle
at the time of the alleged violation, whichever is present if there is such a
person, of the fact of the seizure and impoundment and of the right of the
owner of record to request a vehicle impoundment hearing under this chapter.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.04  NOTICE.
   Within 72 hours after a motor vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to §
79.02, the Police Department shall notify by certified mail the owner of record
and any lien holder of record of the fact of the seizure and impoundment and
the right to request a motor vehicle impoundment hearing under this chapter. 
However, no such notice need be sent to the owner of record if the owner of
record is personally served with the notice at the time the motor vehicle is
seized and impounded and the owner of record acknowledges receipt of such
notice in writing.  A copy of such notice shall be forwarded to the hearing
officer.  The notice shall state the penalties that may be imposed if no
hearing is requested, including that a motor vehicle not released by payment of
the administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees may be sold
or disposed of the city in accordance with applicable law.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.05  HEARING.
   The owner of record seeking a vehicle impoundment hearing shall file a
written request for such a hearing with the Police Department no later then 15
days after notice was mailed or otherwise given to the owner of record.  The
hearing date shall be no more than ten calendar days after a request for a
vehicle impoundment hearing has been filed.  If, after the vehicle impoundment
hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that
the motor vehicle was used in the violation, the hearing officer shall enter an
order finding the owner of record liable to the city for the amount of the
administrative penalty prescribed, plus applicable towing and storage fees
payable to the towing agent.  If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not
determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle was used in
such a violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the
owner of record and for the return of the motor vehicle and any previously paid
administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees; provided that if
the motor vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to state or federal drug
asset forfeiture laws, the motor vehicle shall not be returned unless and until
the city receives notice from the appropriate, state, or where applicable,
federal officials that forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or
forfeiture proceedings have concluded and there is a settlement or a court
order providing that the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of
record.  If the owner of record requests a vehicle impoundment hearing but
fails to appear at such hearing or fails to request a vehicle impoundment
hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be deemed to have waived
his right to such a hearing and the hearing officer shall enter a default order
in favor of the city for the amount of the administrative penalty prescribed,
plus applicable towing and storage fees payable to the towing agent.  However,
if the owner of record pays such administrative penalty and applicable towing
and storage fees and motor vehicle is returned to the owner of record, no
default order need to be entered if the owner of record is informed of his
right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which case an order of
liability shall be deemed to have been made when the city receives the written
waiver.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.06  HEARING OFFICER; PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   The Mayor or her designee shall serve as the hearing officer for the
vehicle impounding hearings under this chapter.
   (B)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at any vehicle impoundment hearing.  The formal rules of evidence will
not apply at any such hearing.
   (C)   Any sworn or affirmed report, including a report prepared in
compliance with § 11-501.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §
11-501.1) that is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement officer's
duties and sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to the impoundment,
shall be admissible evidence of the owner of record's liability under § 79.02
and shall support a finding of the owner of record's liability under § 79.02,
unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.07  DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDMENT VEHICLE.
   (A)   Any administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a debt due and owing the city which may be enforced in any manner
provided by law.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a motor vehicle
impounding pursuant to this chapter shall remain impoundment until:
      (1)   The administrative penalty is paid in full to the city and all
applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case
the owner of record shall be given possession of the motor vehicle;
      (2)   A cash bond in the amount of $500 is posted with the city and all
applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the towing agent, at which time
the motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record; or
      (3)   The motor vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a
judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law.
   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever a person
with a lien of record against a motor vehicle impounded under this section has
commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be
given to that person if he pays the applicable towing and storage fees and
agrees in writing to refund to the city the net proceeds of any foreclosure
sale, less any amounts necessary to pay all lien holders of record, up to the
total amount of administrative penalties imposed under this chapter.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no vehicle that was seized
and impounded pursuant to state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws shall be
returned to the owner of record unless and until the city has received notice
from the appropriate state, or where applicable, federal officials that
forfeiture proceedings will not be instituted; or forfeiture proceedings have
concluded and there is a settlement or a court order providing that the vehicle
shall be returned to the owner of record.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.08  POSTING OF BOND.
   If a cash bond of $500 is posted with the city comptroller, the impounded
motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record upon the payment of any
applicable towing and storage fees to the towing agent.  If an administrative
penalty is imposed for any violation under § 79.02, the cash bond will be
forfeited to the city; however, in the event a violation under § 79.02 is not
proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the cash bond will be returned to
the person posting the bond.  Any bond money to be forfeited to the city
pursuant to this section shall be held by the city comptroller until 30 days
after an administrative penalty is imposed by the hearing officer under this
chapter, or, if there is a judicial review, until a final judgment is rendered
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2011-MC01, passed 4-25-2011)
§ 79.09  FAILURE TO PAY PENALTY.
   If the administrative penalty and applicable towing and storage fees are not
paid within 30 days after and administrative penalty is imposed under this
chapter against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the
vehicle impoundment hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and
shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
unclaimed vehicles.  In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and
applicable towing and storage fees are not paid within 30 days after the
expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's
determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action seeking
administrative review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is
applicable, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed
of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles;
provided that, if the motor vehicle was seized and impounded pursuant to state
or federal drug asset forfeiture laws and proceedings have been instituted
under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the motor vehicle may not be
disposed of by the city except as consistent with those proceedings.

CHAPTER 114:  SIMPLIFIED MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAX
Editor's notes:
   Prior to January 1, 2003, the City of Villa Grove imposed a 5% Municipal
Telecommunications Tax and a 1% Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance
Fee, as authorized by state statutes. Those charges were the subject of §§
114.01 -
114.08 of this
Chapter 114.
   However, the State of Illinois enacted the Simplified Municipal
Telecommunications Tax Act, effective July 1, 2002, to apply on and after
January 1, 2003, which replaced such prior taxes and fees, for which a
municipality could levy such tax at a rate not to exceed 6% of the gross charge
for telecommunications purchased at retail.
   Municipalities which, prior to the implementation of that Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, had adopted prior municipal
telecommunications tax charges confirmed by the State of Illinois Department of
Revenue, were not required to adopt an ordinance imposing the new Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax. Rather, that new tax at the rate determined
by the Illinois Department of Revenue, commenced on January 1, 2003.
   The City of Villa Grove was, pursuant to that procedure, duly notified by
the Department of Revenue that it would, effective January 1, 2003, have a 4.5%
Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax.
   A municipality could however, by ordinance, change the rate of such new
January 1, 2003, tax from the rate determined by the Department of Revenue to
another rate selected by the municipality, not to exceed 6%.
   The City of Villa Grove Ordinance No. 092302A, adopted on September 23,
2002, amended the rate of such tax to 6% on January 1, 2003, and added §
114.09 Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax to the City Code. Said
Ordinance was duly filed with the Department of Revenue and remains in effect.
   Since January 1, 2003, the provisions of the Illinois State statute
comprising the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act, 35 ILCS 636/5-
1, et seq., apply in all respects to the imposition and collection of such tax
and the provisions of Villa Grove's 1998 §§
114.01 -
114.08 inclusive of
Chapter 114 were rendered inapplicable.
   However, since the prior §§
114.01 -
114.08 were the basis for the State's determination of the applicability of the
Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax on January 1, 2003, the City
Attorney advised that the repeal of those prior provisions might appear to
affect the authority of the City to continue the imposition and collection of
said Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax.
   Accordingly, those provisions are still included in this Chapter, subject to
these Editor's Notes.
   Section
114.09 Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax, adopted in Ordinance No.
092302A, on September 23, 2002, remains in effect as the basis for the
continuing imposition of such tax.

   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Building Inspector.  The Building Inspector shall
not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      (1)   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      (2)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (3)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

elevation.  Any development located on land that can be shown by survey
elevation to be below the base flood elevation.  Any development located on
land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood
elevation and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first
flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to
the requirements of this chapter.  In addition, any development located on land
shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a
flood source, but not identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance
rate map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The Building Inspector shall maintain documentation of the existing
ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate
map identification.
      (3)   The Building Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. 
The Building Inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other federal,
state, and local permits have been obtained.

§ 151.11  VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Board of Appeals for a
variance.  The Board of Appeals shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the City Council.  The City
Council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The Board of Appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of §
151.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic structures.  Variances to the building protection
requirements of §
151.07 which are requested in connection with reconstruction, repair, or
alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in §
151.02, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
§§
151.06 and
151.07 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; or
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture.
      (1)   Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall be decided
individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's unique
circumstances.  Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as well
as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
      (2)   In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and
the threat to public health and safety, the following conditions shall be
included for any variance issued for agricultural structures that are
constructed at-grade and wet-floodproofed.
         (a)   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure.  Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
         (b)   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
         (c)   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures,
the exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation,
wall framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base
flood elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance
with §
151.07.
         (d)   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in
accordance with §
151.07.  All of the building's structural components must be capable of
resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic, buoyancy, and
hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
         (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with §
151.07.
         (f)   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to
the 100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters in accordance with §
151.07(B).
         (g)   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of §
151.06.  No variances may be issued for agricultural structures within any
designated floodway. 
         (h)   Wet-floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the Floodplain Administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction.
(Ord. 2011-MC03, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 151.12  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study.  Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage.  This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 2011-MC03, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 151.13  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city to
fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program including:
2005-MC01 passed on January 10, 2005.  However, this chapter does not repeal
the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the
program.  Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.  Where this chapter and other
ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-MC03, passed 5-9-2011)
§ 151.99  PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter.  Upon due investigation, the city may determine that
a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists.  The city shall
notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten days notice to correct the violation:
      (1)   The city shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (B)   (1)   The city shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The city is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension
of the subject development.  The stop-work order shall be in writing, indicate
the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to
resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order.  The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Board of Appeals.  Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   The time and place of the hearing.
      (4)   At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on their behalf.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board
of Appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations.  All costs connected therewith
shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 154.03  APPLICATION AND JURISDICTION; COMPLIANCE.
   No person shall subdivide any tract of land which is located within the city
or in any unincorporated area which is located entirely or in part within 1½
miles of the nearest limits of the city, except in conformity with the
provisions of these regulations. The subdivision plans and plats, proposed
improvements to be installed, and all procedures relating thereto, shall in all
respects be in full compliance with the regulations herein.
   (A)   Wherever any subdivision of land shall hereafter be laid out within
the incorporated limits of the city, or within contiguous territory not more
than 1½ miles beyond the incorporated boundaries of the city, the subdivider
thereof or his or her agent shall submit both a preliminary and a final
subdivision plat to the city for its approval. The subdivision plats and all
procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance with
these regulations.
   (B)   Until plats and plans for the subdivision are approved:
      (1)   No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any
improvements made to the natural land;
      (2)   No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be
offered for sale, nor shall any sale, contract for sale or option be made or
given;
      (3)   No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water
drainage, sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service,
lighting, grading, paving or surfacing of streets, shall hereafter be made by
any owner or owners or his or her or their agent, or by any public service
corporation at the request of the owner or owners or his or her or their agent;
      (4)   Land subject to flooding or poor drainage. No plat will be approved
for a subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains poor
drainage facilities and which would make adequate drainage of the lots and
streets impossible. However, if the subdivider agrees to make improvements
which will make the area completely safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot
and street drainage, the subdivision may then be approved.
   (C)   All offerings or dedication of land to the city for use as streets,
highways, alleys, schools, parks, playgrounds, or other public uses shall be
referred to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation before being
accepted by the City Council or by any other governing authority of the city.
   (D)   Where a tract of land proposed for subdivision is part of a larger,
logical subdivision unit in relation to the city as a whole, the Plan
Commission may, before approval, cause to be prepared a plan for the entire
area or neighborhood, the plan to be used by the Commission as an aid in
judging the proposed plat. The City Engineer shall cooperate with the
Commission in the preparation of this plan and shall furnish the surveys and
data as may be necessary.

ZONING DISTRICTS; ZONING MAP
§ 155.015  DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS.
   In order to carry out the purposes and provisions of these standards, the
city is hereby divided into the following districts.
   (A)   Agricultural District (A-1).  The A-1 Zone in which agriculture and
certain related uses are encouraged as the principal land use.  The specific
intent is to facilitate the proper use of lands best suited for agriculture by
preventing the mixture of urban and rural uses which creates incompatibility
and conflict, places unbalanced tax loads on agricultural lands to help pay for
urban services, and contributes to the premature termination of agricultural
pursuits.  This zone is also designed to prevent the illogical placement of
residential uses in the otherwise open countryside.
   (B)   Residential districts.
      (1)   One-Family Dwelling District (R-1).  The R-1 Zone is established to
recognize areas presently existing or proposed for single-family dwellings.
These standards recognize the need for providing adequate space for buildings,
open areas and off-street parking.
      (2)   General Residence District (R-2).  The R-2 Zone is established to
recognize areas presently existing or proposed for either single-family, two-
family or multiple-family dwellings. These standards recognize the need for
properly regulated areas for higher density residential uses. The standards
reflect the corresponding space requirements of higher density residential
uses.
   (C)   Business districts.
      (1)   Limited Retail Business District (B-1).  The B-1 Zone is
established to protect compatible limited retail business uses. The uses as
clothing, variety, drug and jewelry stores are generally compatible when
located in proximity to one another. Deleterious commercial uses should be
separated from the limited retail uses.
      (2)   General Retail, Service and Wholesale Business District (B-2).  The
B-2 Zone is established to permit those commercial uses excluded from the
limited retail business district. These uses are of the type that generally
require more space or are incompatible with limited retail business uses.
   (D)   Manufacturing District (M-1).  The M-1 Zone is established to protect
the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the
community by the proper allocation of land for industrial use. It is also the
aim of the M-1 Zone to protect and promote the economic base of the city by
regulating manufacturing development in appropriate locations.
   (E)   Mobile Home Park District (M-P).  The M-P Zone is established to
recognize areas presently existing or proposed for mobile home parks.  These
standards recognize the need for providing adequate and secure space, open
areas and off-street parking for mobile homes.
(1992 Code, § 155.015)  (Ord. passed 5- -1969)
§ 155.016  ZONING MAPS.
   The locations and boundaries of the districts established herein are shown
upon the zoning map, which is hereby incorporated into these standards. The
zoning map, together with all notations, references and other information shown
thereon, and all amendments thereto, shall be a part hereof and shall have the
same force and effect as is the zoning map, together with all notations,
references and other information shown thereon, were fully set forth and
described herein.
(1992 Code, § 155.016)  (Ord. passed 5- -1969)
§ 155.017  ZONING OF STREETS, ALLEYS, PUBLIC WAYS AND RAILROADS.
   All streets, alleys, public-ways and railroad rights-of-way, if not
otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same use
district as the property immediately abutting upon the alleys, streets, public-
ways and railroad rights-of-way. Where the center line of a street, alley,
public-way or railroad rights-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning
of the areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be
the same as that of the abutting property up to the center line.
(1992 Code, § 155.017)  (Ord. passed 5- -1969)
§ 155.018  BOUNDARY LINES.
   Wherever any uncertainty the boundary of any use district as shown on the

§ 155.125  PURPOSE.
   The principal objective of these standards for land use control is to
provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible buildings and land uses and
for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and
economic welfare of the city. To accomplish this objective, each type and kind
of use is classified as permitted in 1 or more of the various districts
established herein. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified
and permitted in each district, there are certain additional uses which it may
be necessary to allow because of their unusual characteristics or the service
they provide the public. These special uses require particular consideration as
to their proper location in relation to adjacent established or intended uses
or to the planned development of the community. The conditions controlling the
location and operation of the “special uses” are established by the following
provisions of this section.

the effective date of these standards shall undergo a decrease in number of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or
other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading
facilities, and further, when the decrease would result in a requirement for

herein, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly provided that
existing parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the
facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading
requirements resulting from application of the provisions of these standards to
the entire building or structure as modified.
      (3)   When a building or structure shall undergo any increase in number
of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of
measurement specified herein after for required parking or loading facilities,
and further, when the increase would result in a requirement for additional
total parking or loading spaces through application of the provisions of these
standards, parking and loading facilities may be increased accordingly,

existence and in a conforming use on the effective date of these standards and
which subsequently shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause may be reconstructed, re-established or repaired with or without
off-street parking or loading facilities, except that parking or loading

way of carrying out the strict letter of the Zoning Code, the Board may
authorize a variation in the application of the regulations of the Zoning Code
in harmony with their general purpose and intent, in the following instances:
      (1)   To permit a front yard, a side yard, and/or a rear yard less than
that required by the Zoning Code, but the variation shall not exceed 25% of the
depth of the front yard, or the width of a side yard, as required by the Zoning
Code;
      (2)   The Board is hereby authorized to vary the rear lot requirements to
reduce rear lot measurements to as low as 10 feet; except on corner lots where
buildings are erected to front on the long dimension of a lot, and except on
triangular, irregular and odd shaped lots, the Board is hereby authorized to
vary the rear lot measurements to as low as 5 feet;

   (D)   In considering all proposed variations to the Zoning Code, the Board
shall, before making any variation from the regulation in a specific case,
first determine and make a finding of fact that the proposed variation will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, increase the
congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire or endanger the
public safety, and unreasonably diminish or impair established property values
within the surrounding area.
   (E)   The concurring vote of 3 members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the administrative
official charged with the enforcement of the Zoning Code or to decide in favor
of the applicant any matter upon which the Board is authorized by the Zoning
Code to render a decision.

Illinois law).  The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or

the participants (members of the public, applicant and city included)

hearing, is through correspondence which is filed with the City Clerk (and,
thus, available for everyone to view), or concerns location, time or other
similar scheduling aspects of the public meeting or public hearing, or the,
notices for same.  The only additional exception from this restriction is that
the hearing officer may confer with the City Clerk about the upkeep or status
of the public record, make a request to review or copy the public record, or
confer with the City Clerk regarding the scheduling or location of the public
meeting or hearing, or arrangements for the notices of the pubic meeting and

(Ord. 042604D, passed 4-26-2004)
§ 156.07  PUBLIC COMMENT; WRITTEN AND ORAL.

public record.
   (E)   Although late filed public comments are not part of the public record

   (D)   In making its decision, the City Council shall consider the public
record of the hearing proceedings. The City Council shall give greater
evidentiary weight to sworn testimony and evidence presented during the public
hearings than to un-sworn oral or written comment.
   (E)   No determination by the City Council of a petition may be
reconsidered, except to the extent it is reversed and remanded on appeal and
the City Council is directed by the Illinois Pollution Control Board or
Illinois Appellate Court to conduct all or part of the review process again.
   (F)   Any City Council member may be excused from participation in the
hearing and decision upon demonstration of any disqualifying direct and
personal interest in the property or the affairs of the applicant or any
objector to the proceedings.  Additionally, any City Council member may abstain
from voting on the decision, except to the extent there are insufficient number
of Council Members to pass a resolution consistent with subsection (A)(1),
above.
