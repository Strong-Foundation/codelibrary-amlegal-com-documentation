   (B)   Scope. The policy includes all funds governed by the Village Council.
   (C)   Prudence.
      (1)   Investments shall be made with judgement and care, under

principal;
         (c)   Liquidity maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements; and
         (d)   Yield attainment of market rates of return.

effectiveness in meeting the entity’s needs for safety, liquidity, rate of
return, diversification and its general performance.

(Treasurer) who, under the delegation of the Village Council, shall establish
written procedures for the operation of the investment program.

services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved security
brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.

      (1)   Investments may be made in any type of security allowed for in
Illinois statutes regarding the investment of public funds.
      (2)   Investments shall be made that reflect the cash flow needs of the
fund type being invested.
   (I)   Collateralization. Funds on deposit (checking accounts, certificates
of deposit and the like) in excess of FDIC limits must be secured by some form
of collateral, witnessed by a written agreement and held at an independent
third party institution in the name of the municipality.
   (J)   Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the village, shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by
an independent third party custodian designated by the Village Treasurer and

   (K)   Diversification. The entity shall diversify its investments to the
best of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs
of those funds. Diversification can be by type of investment, number of
institutions invested in, and length of maturity.
   (L)   Maximum maturities.
      (1)   To the extent possible, the village shall attempt to match its
investments with anticipated cash flow requirements.
      (2)   Unless matched to a specific cash flow, the village will not
directly invest in securities maturing more than one year from the date of
purchase.
      (3)   Reserve funds may be invested in securities exceeding one year if
the maturity of the investments are made to coincide as nearly as practicable
with the expected use of the funds.
   (M)   Internal control.
      (1)   The Village Treasurer is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an internal control structure designed to insure that the assets of
the entity are protected from loss, theft or misuse.
      (2)   The internal control structure shall be designed to provide
reasonable assurance that these objectives are met.
      (3)   The internal controls shall address the following points:
         (a)   Control of collusion;
         (b)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting;
         (c)   Custodial safekeeping; and
         (d)   Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments
and wire transfers.
   (N)   Performance standards. This investment portfolio will be managed in
accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio
should obtain a comparable rate of return during a market/economic environment
of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to
benchmarks with similar maturity, liquidity and credit quality as the

benefit or service.
   (B)   The village shall uphold all laws related to sexual harassment.
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         SEXUAL HARASSMENT.  Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for
sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:
            1.   Submission to that conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individuals employment;
            2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or
            3.   The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment.
      (2)   Sexual harassment may involve individuals of the same or different
gender.
         (a)   Sexual harassment is most frequently associated with those
situations in which a power differential exists between persons involved;
however, it also may occur between individuals of the same status.
         (b)   Examples of conduct which may, if continued or repeated,
constitute sexual harassment are:
            1.   Unnecessary touching, patting, hugging or brushing against a
person’s body; staring, ogling, leering, whistling;
            2.   Sexually explicit statements, comments, questions, jokes or
anecdotes; graphic comments about a person’s clothing or body;
            3.   Sexually suggestive objects or pictures in the work place;
            4.   Harassing use of the electronic mail or telephone
communication system; and/or
            5.   Other physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
         (c)   This conduct, whether intended or not, constitutes sexual
harassment and is illegal under both state and federal law. Violations of this
policy will not be permitted.
      (3)   Procedure for the resolution of sexual harassment complaints.
         (a)   The village encourages anyone who feels that he or she has been
a victim of sexual harassment to report the incidents to the Mayor or Village
Board member. Complainants are urged to report sexual harassment incidents as
soon as possible, since a delay in reporting may make it difficult to gather
appropriate information and documentation.
            1.   It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at
the person making the complaint.
            2.   The following steps may also be taken: document or record each
incident (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place).
Documentation can be strengthened by written records such as letters, notes,
memos and telephone messages.
         (b)   Complaints will be kept in confidence to the extent practicable
and appropriate under the circumstances;
         (c)   The Mayor with approval of the Board shall appoint a committee
of at least three people, one of which shall be the attorney for the village.
The role of the committee will be to hear and consider testimony and other
relevant reliable evidence, to make findings of fact, to determine whether the
village’s policy on sexual harassment has been violated, and if so, to
recommend appropriate relief and disciplinary action(s). A copy of the written
decision shall be promptly furnished to the employee making the complaint; and
         (d)   The employee will be able to have a representative present at
any discussion between the employee and the Village Board or committee.
      (4)   The employee making the complaint may elect to file a written
complaint with the Illinois Department of Human Rights or the Illinois Human
Rights Commission. The alternative complaint avenues are available if the
employee would prefer to use them instead of the internal procedures.
         (a)   Illinois Department of Human Rights: 312-814-6245.
         (b)   Illinois Human Rights Commission: 217-785-4350.
      (5)   The employee is protected by the Illinois Human Rights Act (775
ILCS 5/6-101, 1994 State Bar Edition) from retaliation because he or she has
opposed that which he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be
unlawful sexual harassment in employment or because he or she has made a
charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or participated in an
investigation under this act.
   (C)   The village will assure non-discriminatory employment practices in
recruitment, recruitment advertising, employment, placement, layoff or
termination, promotion, demotion or transfer, rate of pay or other forms of
compensation and use of facilities.
   (D)   The village will not contract with other agencies, banks, businesses,
vendors and the like, who practice or establish a pattern of discrimination
based on sex, color, race, religion, age, developmentally disabled/handicap,
national origin, political affiliation or belief.
   (E)   The village assures that it will actively provide non-discriminatory
outreach, selection and service to all individuals.
   (F)   Efforts will be made to hire minority individuals for all job
categories so that minority employment in all categories of the work force will
represent a proportionate share of minority populations in the village as well
as surrounding areas.
   (G)   The village will provide accommodations to the best of its ability for
developmentally disabled/handicapped employees contingent on budget and
structural limitations.
   (H)   All village employees are expected to adhere to the above policy and
to work actively for its implementation both internally and in carrying out
village program activities.
   (I)   The village designates the Mayor and Village Board to carry out the
EEO/AA plan.

the connection. Each application shall state the name of the applicant, the
permit desired, the location to be used, the fee to be paid and the additional
information as may be needed for the proper administration of this title. The
application shall constitute an agreement by the applicant to abide by all of
the terms of this title and the rules and regulations as may be from time to
time enacted hereunder, and to pay fees, charges, fines and penalties as may be
contained herein. The permit referred to herein shall be displayed by the

representative, upon request. The Village Council may, from time to time,
prescribe the form of application and permits referred to herein. Any
connection or opening made in the combined waterworks and sewerage system

handle the additional anticipated waste load.
   (B)   Applications; form of permit; additional information. There shall be
two classes of building sewer permits:
      (1)   For residential, wastewater service; and

application on a special form furnished by the Village Council.
   (C)   Connections; costs of materials. The cost of all labor and materials
required for connection to the combined waterworks and sewerage system or

the case of installation of one-inch residential water service, the water
meter, meter tile and cover, shall be provided and maintained by the village.
The point of connection for the purposes of this title is hereby determined to
be the point on the public sewer or public water main, respectively, at which
the applicant/user accesses sewer or water service. The applicant/user shall
indemnify and hold the village harmless from any loss or damage occasioned by
his or her connection, maintenance or use of the system.
   (D)   Connections/service; inspections. No person shall make a connection to
or service a connection to the combined waterworks and sewerage system pursuant
to a permit issued under this section without having the connection or service
work inspected by the Superintendent or some person authorized by him or her to
make the inspection. No connection or service work shall be covered prior to
the inspection being made and a certificate thereof being filed with the
Village Clerk. Application for inspection or service work by the village shall
be in writing to the Village Clerk not less than 24 hours prior to the time of
inspection.
   (E)   Connections; specifications. All connections to the combined
waterworks and sewerage system shall be in accordance with this section. The

methods to be used in excavating, place of the pipe, jointing, testing and
backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the Building
and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of the village. In
the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and
procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of
Testing Materials, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9
and Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois
shall apply. On private property, all building sewers connecting to public
sewer main shall be installed at an elevation not less than 42 inches below
finished grade. On public property, all building sewers shall be as deep as
practicable, and in no event shall be at an elevation higher than the water
main. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform
to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Code, or other applicable
rules and regulations of the village, or the procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials, Water
Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 and Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois. All
connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight. All building sewers
connecting to a public sewer main shall be six inches in diameter and installed
with a six inch cleanout/inspection vertical standpipe located as near to the
property line as practicable. The cleanout/inspection vertical standpipe shall
be connected to the building sewer by means of a “T” type fitting. All
inspection “Ts” shall be accessible at finished grade and sealed in a manner to
prevent groundwater penetration or infiltration. Any deviation from the
prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the village before
installation.
   (F)   Connection/disconnection fees. The Council may establish from time to
time, fees for the connection and disconnection to and from the combined
waterworks and sewerage system. The initial fees upon enactment of this title,

service of all outstanding bonds by the number of users. Through further
divisions, the monthly and/or quarterly debt service charges can be computed.
   (B)   The capital improvement charge  is levied on all users to provide for
capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction or the sewage treatment
works. The capital improvement charge is computed by dividing the annual amount
by the number of users.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l; and
      (2)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l. It shall consist of
operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as
follows:
         (a)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be
treated;

   (A)   The village shall have a continuing lien upon the premises and real
estate upon or for which water and sewer services are supplied by the combined
waterworks and sewerage system for the water or sewer fees as provided in this
chapter. Every lien shall, upon compliance with the conditions set forth in
this chapter, become and be prior and superior to the rights and interest of
creditors, encumbrances, purchasers and other parties in interest in the
premises and real estate, however, the village shall have no preference over
the rights of any purchaser, mortgagee, judgment creditor of other lien holder
arising prior to the filing of the notice of the liens in the office of the
Recorder of the county in which the real estate is located.
   (B)   Notice of the lien shall be given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to the owners of record of the real estate, as referred by the
taxpayers identification number. The notice shall include:
      (1)   A copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is
delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notices sufficient to inform
the owner or owners of record as referred by the taxpayer’s identification
number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent; and
      (2)   A notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the real
estate.
   (C)   Whenever a bill for water service or wastewater service charges has
been deemed delinquent, the Village Clerk shall file with the Recorder of Deeds
a statement of lien claim, verified by affidavit. The statement shall contain a
sufficiently correct legal description of the lot or tract of land to identify
the same, the balance due including all costs and reasonable attorney’s fees
after allowing all credits, and a notice that the village claims a lien for
this amount. No lien shall be defeated because of an error or overcharge on the
part of the village, nor shall any lien be defeated upon proof that the water
or sewer connection charges were incurred by a tenant of the premises or
occupant other than the owner.
   (D)   If payment is not made, as provided in this chapter, of any water or
sewer charges when the same become due, and if the charges have become
delinquent, the village may file or cause to be filed a complaint in the
Circuit Court of the county for the foreclosure of the lien, or upon becoming a
defendant in any pending suit affecting the premises or real estate, by answer
to the complaint, petition to intervene, counter complaint or cross complaint
as the Village Attorney may deem necessary to foreclose the lien. The village
may proceed, in its corporate name, to foreclose the lien in like manner and
with like effect as provided by the statutes of the state in foreclosure of
mechanics’ liens or other statutory liens. The suit shall be commenced or
answered by cross complaint filed within two years after the accrual of the
water or sewer connection charges. Any decree rendered in the court may be
enforced and collected as other decrees or judgments in the same court. The
Village Attorney is authorized and directed to institute the foreclosure
proceedings in the name of the village for the water service or wastewater
service charges deemed delinquent.
   (E)   In addition to the remedies set forth above, the village may also file
an action based upon a breach of contract or other appropriate action against
the owner, occupant of persons in possession to collect on the delinquent
account and to recover its costs and reasonable attorneys fees incurred
therewith. The action may be filed independently of, or in addition to any lien
claim, foreclosure proceeding or other proceeding instituted by the village.
   (F)   On any account deemed delinquent as defined herein, the owner,
occupant and user of the water services shall be jointly and severally liable
for the payment and satisfaction of all costs incurred by the village in any
way related to all delinquent accounts. Costs include, but are not limited to,
recording costs, court costs, filing fees, deposition expenses, subpoena fees,
travel charges, copy and fax charges, expert witness fees, postage costs and
other similar expenses. In addition, the owner, occupant and user of the water
services shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment and satisfaction
of all reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the village in any way related to
all delinquent accounts, whether incurred with or without a lawsuit or whether
incurred with or without the recording of a lien.
   (G)   The remedies provided in this section for the collection of delinquent
water or sewer charges shall not be construed to abridge or in any manner
interfere with the right and power of the village to enforce collection thereof
by any other action the village may deem necessary or appropriate. The remedies
provided in this section shall be taken and held as an additional means to
enforce payment of the delinquent water or sewer charges.

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system;
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety; and
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and consumer’s potable water systems.
   (B)   Application.  These Rules and Regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the village.
   (C)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or backsiphonage of contaminants through the customer’s water service
connection.  If, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water or his or her
authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary
for the safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent of Water
shall give notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention
device at each service connection to the premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved device or devices at his or her own expense;
failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install the device
or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service
to the premises until the device or devices have been installed. The consumer
shall retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair as
required in § 5D(4) below for a period of at least five years.

   (B)   A police officer finding an illegally parked, abandoned or inoperable
motor vehicle located on public property and not subject to §
7.15.020 shall affix to the motor vehicle an adhesive sticker in a conspicuous
location informing the owner that if the motor vehicle is not removed within 72

when the owner of a motor vehicle has been sent notice of the impending towing
and impoundment of the motor vehicle, but has failed to file a timely written
demand for a pre-tow administrative hearing, a police officer may impound and
tow a motor vehicle upon the expiration of the required notice.
   (F)   Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation upon the authority
of any law enforcement officer to issue a traffic or parking citation or for
the village to pursue any other legal remedies for the removal of any motor
vehicle.

§ 7.15.030  CONDUCT OF HEARINGS.
   (A)   A pre-tow hearing or a post-tow hearing required by this chapter shall
be conducted before a Hearing Officer within 48 hours of receipt of a written
demand from the person seeking the hearing, unless the person waives the rights
to a speedy hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and village holidays are to be excluded
from the calculation of the 48-hour period.
   (B)   The Hearing Officer shall be someone other than the person who
directed the towing and impoundment of the motor vehicle.
   (C)   The sole issue before the Hearing Officer shall be whether there is or
was probable cause to tow and impound the motor vehicle in question. PROBABLE
CAUSE to tow and impound shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a
person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there is or was a
sufficient breach of local,  state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the impoundment and towing of the motor vehicle, or in the case of abandoned or
inoperable motor vehicles located upon private property;  that the motor
vehicle constitutes a public nuisance under the terms of this chapter.
   (D)   The Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The Police Department
shall carry the burden of establishing that there is or was probable cause to
tow and impound the motor vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Hearing Officer shall prepare a written decision in accordance
with §
7.15.035. A copy of the decision shall be provided to the person demanding the
hearing and to the registered owner of the motor vehicle (if not the person
requesting the hearing).
   (E)   The motor vehicle owner shall have the right to appeal the Hearing
Officer’s decision to the Gardner Village Council within seven days following
the date of the Hearing Officer’s decision.  A motor vehicle owner shall
request an appeal on forms provided by the village, and the appeal shall be
considered by the Village Council at the next regularly scheduled Village
Council meeting,  subject to the Illinois Open Meetings Act. The Village
Council shall review the Hearing Officer’s decision de novo. Following an
appeal, the Village Council’s decision shall be final and the hearing process
shall be concluded and immediately enforceable.
   (F)   Failure of the motor vehicle owner to request or attend a scheduled
pre-tow administrative hearing or appeal shall be deemed a waiver of the right
to the hearing or appeal as the case may be.
(Prior Code, § 10.16.060)  (Ord. VG09-002, passed 2-26-2009)
§ 7.15.035  DECISIONS OF HEARING OFFICER.
   (A)   In a pre-tow hearing required by this chapter, the Hearing Officer
shall only determine as to the motor vehicle in question either that there is
probable cause to tow and impound the motor vehicle or that there is no
probable cause. In the event that the Hearing Officer determines that there is
probable cause to tow and impound the motor vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall
prepare and date a certificate of probable cause which will authorize the
Police Department to tow and impound the motor vehicle. In the event that the
Hearing Officer determines that there is no probable cause to tow and impound
the motor vehicle,  the Hearing Officer shall prepare and date a certificate of
no probable cause which will prohibit the Police Department from impounding and
towing the motor vehicle. Copies of the certificate of probable cause or the
certificate of no probable cause, whichever is appropriate, shall be given to
the Police Department, the motor vehicle owner and the property-owner. If the
Hearing Officer’s decision is appealed to the Village Council, all enforcement
activities shall be stayed. If the decision of the Hearing Officer is not
timely appealed, the opportunity for an appeal shall be deemed waived, and the
decision of the Hearing Officer is final.
   (B)   In a post-tow hearing required by this chapter, the Hearing Officer
shall only determine as to the motor vehicle in question either that there was
probable cause to impound and tow the motor vehicle or, that there was no such
probable cause. In the event that the Hearing Officer determines that there was
probable cause to impound and tow the motor vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall
prepare and date a certificate of probable cause, copies of which shall be
given to the Police Department, the commercial towing service having possession
of the motor vehicle, and the motor vehicle owner. In the event that the
Hearing Officer determines that there is no probable cause to tow and impound
the motor vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall prepare and issue a certificate of
no probable cause, copies of which shall be given to the above-named parties.
Upon presentment of the certificate of no probable cause to the commercial
towing service having possession of the motor vehicle by the motor vehicle
owner, the towing service shall release the motor vehicle, and the village
shall pay the towing and storage fees. If the owner of the motor vehicle fails
to present the certificate of no probable cause to the commercial towing
service having possession of the motor vehicle within 24 hours of its receipt
(excluding the days when the commercial towing service is not open for
business), the owner of the motor vehicle shall assume liability for all
subsequent storage charges. If the Hearing Officer’s decision is appealed to
the Village Council, all enforcement activities shall be stayed. If the
decision of the Hearing Officer is not timely appealed,  the opportunity for an
appeal shall be deemed waived, and the decision of the Hearing Officer is
final.

(Ord. VG08-002, § 15.09.010, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 15.10.010  DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD.  The flood having a 1% probability of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FLOOD. The base
flood elevation at any location is as defined in §
15.10.015.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE).  The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BUILDING.  A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof, including manufactured homes, prefabricated buildings, and
gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180 days per year.
   CRITICAL FACILITY.  Any public or private facility which, if flooded, would
create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life
and health. Examples are public buildings, emergency operations and
communication centers, health care facilities and nursing homes, schools and
toxic waste treatment, handling or storage facilities.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Any human-made change to real estate including, but not
necessarily limited to:
      (1)   Demolition, construction, recon- struction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
      (2)   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
      (3)   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for
a manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180
days per year;
      (4)   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts
or similar projects;
      (5)   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls or fences;
      (6)   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving or
other alterations of the ground surface;
      (7)   Storage of materials including the placement of gas and liquid
storage tanks; and
      (8)   Channel modifications or any other activity that might change the
direction, height or velocity of flood or surface waters.
   DEVELOPMENT.  Does not include routine maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities; resurfacing road; or gardening, plowing and similar practices that
do not involve filling, grading or construction of levees.
   FEMA.  Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   FLOOD.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid
accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD FRINGE.  That portion of the floodplain outside of the regulatory
floodway.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP.  A map prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that depicts the floodplain or special flood hazard area
(SFHA) within a community. This map includes insurance rate zones and may or
may not depict floodways and show base flood elevations.
   FLOODPLAIN and SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SERA).  Are synonymous. Those
lands within the jurisdiction of the Village of Gardner that are subject to
inundation by the base flood. The floodplains of the Village of Gardner are
generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map of the Village of
Gardner prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated June 18,
1987, as amended. The floodplains of those parts of unincorporated Grundy
County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that
may be annexed into the village are generally identified as such on the flood
insurance rate map prepared for Grundy County by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and dated December 15, 1994. FLOODPLAIN also includes those
areas of known flooding as identified by the community.
   FLOODPROOFING.  Any combination of structural or nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate, property and their contents.
   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE.  A form published by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that is used to certify that a building has been designed and
constructed to be structurally dry floodproofed to the flood protection
elevation.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION or FPE.  The elevation of the base flood plus one
foot of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
   FLOODWAY.  That portion of the floodplain required to store and convey the
base flood. The floodways for each of the floodplains of the Village of Gardner
shall be according to the best data available from federal, state or other
sources.
   FREEBOARD.  A flood protection elevation requirement designed as a safety
factor which is usually expressed in terms of a specified amount of feet above
a calculated flood level. FREEBOARD requirements add height above the base
flood elevation to account for future flood fringe developments, uncertainties
inherent with methodologies, lack of data, debris that accompanies the base
flood and flood levels higher than that of the base flood. Freeboard
compensates for the effects of any factors that contribute to flood heights
greater than those calculated. These factors include, but are not limited to,
ice jambs, debris accumulation, wave action, obstruction of bridge openings and
floodways, the effects of urbanization on the hydrology of the watershed, loss
of flood storage areas due to development and aggradation of a river or stream
bed. FREEBOARD may be applied not just to the elevation of the lowest floor or
flood proofing level, but also to the level of protection provided to all
components of the structure. All structure utilities, including ductwork, must
be elevated or protected to the freeboard level and all portions of the
structure below the freeboard level must be constructed using materials
resistant to flood damage.
   IDNR/OWR.  Illinois Department of Natural Resources/Office of Water
Resources.
   MANUFACTURED HOME.  A structure transportable in one or more sections that
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.
   NFIP.  National Flood Insurance Program.
   REPETITIVE LOSS.  Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at
the time of each flood event on the average equals or exceeds 25% of the market
value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SFHA.  See definition of FLOODPLAIN.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must
be included in this determination.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
   TRAVEL TRAILER or RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.  A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less in size;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

      (1)   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants or
other hazardous or toxic materials, below the flood protection elevation unless
the materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of §
15.10.035;
      (2)   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
      (3)   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
      (4)   New and replacement on-site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems, shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other above ground
openings located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight; and
      (5)   Critical facilities shall be protected to the 500-year flood
elevation. In addition, all ingress and egress from any critical facility must
be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.
   (B)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
(Ord. VG08-002, § 15.09.090, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 15.10.050  VARIANCES.
   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Planning and Zoning Board
for a variance. The Planning and Zoning Board shall review the applicant’s
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Village
Council. The Village Council may attach such conditions to the granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   (A)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety, or
creation of a nuisance;
      (5)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing or repairs to roads, utilities or other
public facilities;
      (6)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      (7)   All other required state and federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   The Planning and Zoning Board shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of §
15.10.035 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to $25 per
$100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of §
15.10.035 requested in connection with the reconstruction, repair or alteration
of a site or building included on the National. Register of Historic Places or
the Illinois Register of Historic Places may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of divisions §
15.10.045(A)(1) through (A)(5).
(Ord. VG08-002, § 15.09.100, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 15.10.055  DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the Village of Gardner or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. VG08-002, § 15.09.110, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 15.10.060  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter repeals and replaces any and all ordinances previously adopted
by the village to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program; provided, however, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program, nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants
or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. VG08-002, § 15.09.130, passed 3-10-2008)
§ 15.10.999  PENALTY.
   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or, failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Building Inspector may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
Building and Zoning Officer shall notify the owner, in writing of the
violation.
   (A)   If the owner fails, after ten days’ notice, to correct the violation:
      (1)   The village shall make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make the other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      (2)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than $75 nor more than $750 or each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (B)   The Building and Zoning Officer shall inform the owner that any
violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

      (5)   The Village Planning and Zoning Board shall determine that the

   (JJ)   Performance standards.
      (1)   Development. The following performance standards for subdivisions
and their design shall be developed as set forth in this division (JJ).
      (2)   Relation to lot. There shall be private open areas on the lot
related appropriately to its functional areas.  The lot shall be so shaped in
scale as to provide for reasonable alternatives for home placements.  In
subdivisions, provision for positioning of the unit on the lot and for moving
it out are only incidental to the total subdivision design.  Location of
drives, parking areas, carports, and garages must be on individual mobile home
lots.  The parking area must be easy and safe for entrance and convenience from
all directions within the subdivision and from the street or highway. 
Driveways and car shelters shall not be located to interfere with desirable
views from the mobile home or from important areas on the site.
      (3)   Relation of lots to each other.
         (a)   The mobile home as well as functional areas on individual lots
shall complement and supplement those on adjacent lots.  Open areas shall flow
onto open areas enhancing primary views.  Areas on one lot where it is
desirable to enclose the structures, vegetated screening or fences shall adjoin
similar areas on neighboring lots.  Fronting to the inside of a subdivision
block has the definite advantages of providing a view potential, and providing
a play area for children.  Facing the mobile home groupings inward improves the
views, unifies pedestrian ways, and interrelates streets, drives, car storage,
and garbage and trash pickup function. 
         (b)   Interior areas within the mobile home groupings shall be
designed to encourage neighborliness.  Interblock arrangements shall include
easy access from the entrances of mobile homes in the grouping.
      (4)   Subdivision pattern relation of elements.
         (a)   The general subdivision, built from mobile home groupings, shall
fit topography, allow for traffic and pedestrian circulation, and allow for
provision of community facilities and utilities.  Areas for churches, schools,
major parks, and community facilities shall be located appropriately with
respect to the population to be served.  As appropriate, residential areas
shall merge into or be insulated from areas devoted to other purposes.  They
shall be insulated from heavy traffic, concentration of parking, noise, lights,
commercial and industrial activities. 
         (b)   The street pattern shall serve, not shape the lots in the
subdivision.  Lands devoted to streets shall be held to a minimum compatible
with performance of street-related functions.  Minor streets shall feed at
well-spaced intervals and well-designed intersections into collector streets
and arteries for fast-moving traffic.
         (c)   General site planning shall adapt to individual site conditions,
the type of market to be served, reflect advances in site planning techniques,
and be adapted to the trends and designs of the mobile home trailer court.  A
site plan which conforms to and preserves terrain, existing trees, shrubs and
rock formation is highly preferred.
      (5)   Conditions of approval. The proposed site development plan for a
mobile home trailer park subdivision shall be reviewed by the Village Planning
and Zoning Board and must be found to conform to:
         (a)   The specified minimum site standards;
         (b)   The requirements for utilities, permanent facilities, and
resident services;
         (c)   The design review standards as specified in this chapter; and
         (d)   The Village Planning and Zoning Board must make a finding that
the proposed site development meets all of the requirements and design
standards in this Ordinance prior to the issuance of a building permit by the
building inspector, and that all of the required facilities and utilities have
been installed by the subdivision developer prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.

Planning and Zoning Board may by rule provide.
   (D)   Standards for variations. The Village of Gardner Planning and Zoning
Board shall not recommend a variation of the regulations of this chapter, as
authorized herein unless it shall have made findings of fact based upon the
evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the district in which it is located;
      (2)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances;
      (3)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character
of the locality; and
      (4)   For the purpose of implementing the above rules, the Village of
Gardner Planning and Zoning Board shall also, in making its determination
whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into
consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the
applicant have been established by the evidence:
         (a)   The particular physical sur- roundings shape or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular
hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the
strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
         (b)   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based
would not be applicable, generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         (c)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the
owner of the property, or by a previous owner;
         (e)   The proposed variation will not impair the adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in
the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the
neighborhood; and
         (f)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
      (5)   The Village of Gardner Planning and Zoning Board may recommend and
the Village Council require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set
forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such
variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and better to carry out the
general intent of this chapter.
   (E)   Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this chapter
shall be granted by the Village of Gardner Planning and Zoning Board only in
accordance with the standards set out in this section and may be granted only
in the following instances, and in no others:

(Ord. passed 1-12-1976, § XIII-I; Ord. G-136, passed 4-24-1995)
§ 15.15.385  CONDITIONAL PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Purpose. The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive ordinance is
based on the division of the entire village into districts in each of which are
permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to the
permitted, compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses
which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which
on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public
facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation
for the protection of the community. Those uses are classified in this chapter
as “conditional permitted uses” and fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated
utilities, or uses traditionally affected by public interest; or
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their
peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public,
and their possible damaging influence on the neighborhood, may have to be
established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be
allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulation.
   (B)   Initiation. Conditional permitted uses may be proposed by the Village
Council and by any person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive
possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is
described in the application for a conditional permitted use.
   (C)   Processing.
      (1)   An application for a conditional permitted use shall be filed with
the Village Clerk and thereafter entered into the records of the first meeting
thereafter of the Village Council.
      (2)   A copy of the application shall thereafter be forwarded by the
Village Clerk to the Planning and Zoning Board with a request to hold a public
hearing and submit to the Board of Trustees a report of its findings and
recommendations. These public hearing shall be held upon the notice that shall
be required by Illinois Statutes.
   (D)   Decisions.
      (1)   The Village Council upon report of the Planning and Zoning Board
and without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed conditional
permitted use in accordance with applicable Illinois Statutes, or may refer it
back to the Planning and Zoning Board for further consideration.
      (2)   In case a written protest against any proposed conditional

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT
§ 15.15.410  PURPOSE.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The planned development (P.D.) approach provides the flexibility
needed to promote innovative and creative land development that achieves the
community vision outlined in the comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Within the framework of a P.D. normal zoning standards may be
modified. The resulting flexibility is intended to encourage developments that
are more environmentally sensitive, economically viable, and aesthetically
pleasing than might otherwise be possible if the standards of the underlying
zoning district(s) were strictly enforced.
      (3)   A P.D. is intended to remain in substantial compliance with the
densities outlined in the comprehensive plan. Increased densities from the
underlying zoning may be permitted under this section if such increases can be
substantiated based on a superior site design following the village’s design
guidelines.
      (4)   Each proposal for a P.D. shall be presented and judged on its own
merits, and approval shall not be based exclusively on a comparison to an
already existing P.D.
   (B)   Objectives. Specifically, the objectives of a P.D. are:
      (1)   To stimulate creative approaches to the residential, commercial and
industrial development of land;
      (2)   To provide more efficient use of land; and
      (3)   To preserve or enhance natural features and provide open space
areas.
(Ord. VG06-416, passed 10-23-2006)
§ 15.15.415  APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Elective. Any owner of property who wishes to develop his or her
property as a P.D. may voluntarily petition the approval under the provisions
of this chapter.
   (B)   Mandatory.
      (1)   Development of land that includes more than one type of land use on
a single zoning lot shall proceed as a P.D.
      (2)   The Mayor with the consent of the Village Council shall have the
right to require all development of land which meets or exceeds one or more of
the following thresholds to be developed as a P.D.:
         (a)   Development of land totaling 20 or more acres; or
         (b)   Development of land including fifty or more dwelling units.
(Ord. VG06-416, passed 10-23-2006)
§ 15.15.420  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   In recommending approval or granting approval of preliminary development
plans and final development plans, the Planning and Zoning Board and the
Village Council shall ensure that the proposed P.D. meets the following
standards.
   (A)   Ownership. The land intended for the P.D. shall be under single
ownership and/or unified control.
   (B)   Compatibility. The proposed use or combination of uses is consistent
with the goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan.
   (C)   Accessibility. Adequate utilities, road access, draining, police and
fire service and other necessary facilities already exist or will be provided
to serve the proposed P.D.
   (D)   Designation of land for schools, recreational amenities and permanent
common open space. The proposed P.D. shall provide for the dedication of land
for school sites and land for recreational purposes. Alternatively, the Village
Council may approve a cash payment in lieu of actual land dedication, or may
approve a combination of cash and land dedication.
      (1)   Common open space. Common open space shall be provided for
recreational purposes. The open space may be designed for active or passive
recreational use. Common open space shall meet the following standards:
         (a)   Each parcel of common open space intended for active recreation
shall be at least 12,000 square feet. The minimum width of the common open
space shall allow for the safe participation in the active recreational
activities for which it is designed. For trail purposes the minimum open space
width shall be 20 feet;
         (b)   Each parcel must be accessible to all the residents of the
proposed P.D. Sidewalks, bike trails or pedestrian trails must link the
parcels;
         (c)   The slope must be appropriate for the activities for which the
common open space is intended; and
         (d)   Land dedicated for public park purposes may be included in the
calculation of usable common open space.
      (2)   Areas excluded from common open space. Common open space shall not
include:
         (a)   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual
tenant or owner;
         (b)   Dedicated streets, alleys, and other public rights-of-way;
         (c)   Required detention areas, floodplains or wetlands, unless the
Village Council determines that natural features, such as a creek or lake, will
be a substantial amenity for the development;
         (d)   Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land less than 50 feet
wide, unless containing a trail or bicycle path; and
         (e)   Existing permanent utility easements.
   (E)   Open space ownership and maintenance.
      (1)   Public or private ownership. The public or private ownership and
maintenance responsibilities for all common open spaces shall be established by
the developer and approved as part of the ordinance authorizing the P.D. All
common areas should be platted as separate outlots. Restrictive covenants
running with the land shall guarantee that the common open space will be
properly cared for and used only for purposes designated in the P.D.’s approved
final development plan.
      (2)   Maintenance. To ensure appropriate long-term maintenance of private
common open space the developer shall submit a detailed open space management
plan describing the method and schedule of maintenance.
   (F)   Limits on use. No common open space may be put to any use not
specified in the final development plan unless the final development plan has
been amended according to §
15.15.450 of this chapter.
   (G)   Special service area. A back-up (dormant) special service area shall
be required, at the sole discretion of the Village Council, to ensure adequate
property maintenance. This special service area shall be created at the time of
final platting of the first phase of the P.D., and shall include all phases of
the planned development. In the event the entity that has ownership and
maintenance responsibilities fails to adequately manage the open space, the
village may assume maintenance responsibilities until such time as that or
another appropriate entity can manage the open space. The village may tax the
property of those within the special service area for the village’s prior and
estimated future cost of maintaining the open space.
   (H)   Completion of recreational facilities and other site amenities.
      (1)   Commencement of construction. Construction of recreational
facilities and other improvements to common open spaces serving a P.D. shall
commence in accordance with the approved P.D. ordinance. At a minimum, the
improvements shall commence prior to the completion of not more than 33% of the
dwelling units in the development or prior to the completion of the first 75
dwelling units, whichever comes first.
      (2)   Completion of construction. Recreation facilities and other
improvements to common open spaces shall be completed prior to the issuance of
building permits for the last 25% of the dwelling units, or 25% of the total
gross floor area of commercial and industrial uses within a P.D. developed as a
single phase.
      (3)   Phased developments. In P.D.s containing two or more phases,
construction of recreation facilities in earlier phases shall be completed
prior to the issuance of occupancy permits for the next phase of the P.D.
   (I)   Commercial development. Commercial development within a P.D. should be
focused on the provision of goods and services to community residents. To
further this goal, a maximum of 30% of the building square footage within a
commercial P.D. should be comprised of non-retail uses.
   (J)   Additional conditions. To meet the unique circumstances presented by
each P.D., and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of existing
village residents and the residents of the proposed development, the Village
Council reserves the right to attach any other conditions it deems necessary,
but not specifically provided in this chapter, to the approval of the P.D.s.
Such additional conditions may include, but are not limited to, more stringent
requirements for construction, phasing and revocation.
(Ord. VG06-416, passed 10-23-2006)
§ 15.15.425  PERMITTED VARIATIONS FROM VILLAGE ORDINANCES.
   (A)   General. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this section,
planned developments shall be developed in conformity with this chapter and all
other applicable codes and ordinances of the village. Modifications that
deviate from the bulk, density and design provisions in this Zoning Ordinance
and in other applicable regulations are privileges and will be considered by
the village only in direct response to the tangible community benefits received
from the P.D. These benefits shall be in the form of: exceptional amenities;
outstanding environmental, landscape, architectural or site design; or the
conservation of special human-made or natural features of the site.
   (B)   Bulk regulations. P.D.s are governed by the bulk regulations of the
underlying zoning district. However, the Planning and Zoning Board may
recommend and Village Council may authorize, exceptions to the applicable bulk
regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of the planned development
including building height, lot area, lot width, and yard setback requirements,
provided that:
      (1)   The exceptions shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
efficient and coordinated site plan, no less beneficial to the residents or
occupants of the development, as well as the neighboring property, than would
be obtained under the bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed
on separate zoning lots; and
      (2)   Along the periphery of the P.D.s, yards or setbacks shall be
provided that meet or exceed the regulations of the district in which the P.D.
is located.
   (C)   Land uses. The Planning and Zoning Board may recommend, and Village
Council may authorize, that there be permitted in part of the area of a
proposed P.D., and for the duration of the development, specified uses not
permitted by the use regulations of the district in which the development is
proposed. Proposed P.D.s with mixed land uses shall not be recommended or
approved unless:
      (1)   The proposed land uses are necessary or desirable and are
appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the P.D.; and
      (2)   The proposed uses are not of such a nature or so located as to
exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood.
   (D)   Other. See §
15.15.445 below for additional required findings.
(Ord. VG06-416, passed 10-23-2006)
§ 15.15.430  APPROVAL PROCEDURES FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.
   A P.D. shall be granted as a conditional permitted use to the zoning
district in which it is located. The Village Council is the final decision-
making body. For all purposes herein, a special use shall be considered the
same as a conditional permitted use. The process for obtaining a P.D. approval
shall be as follows.
   (A)   Pre-application meeting and concept plan.
      (1)   Purpose. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a
P.D., the applicant shall request a meeting with the P.D. Review Committee in
order to present a concept plan of the proposed P.D. The nature of this meeting
is advisory only. Nothing offered or said by the P.D. Review Committee shall be
construed as an approval of the project or approval of any particular element
of the project. All advice and recommendations are subject to modification
during later stages of the approval procedure as outlined in this section, and
the petitioner remains responsible for ensuring that all applicable village
ordinances and standards are met. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is
to help the applicant determine whether:
         (a)   The concept plan appears to be in compliance with the provisions
of this chapter and all other applicable village standards and ordinances.
         (b)   Any zoning amendment or variation is required in connection with
the proposed development.
         (c)   The concept plan appears to be in conformity with the land-use
policies and objectives of the village as expressed in the village
comprehensive plan and this chapter.
      (2)   Creation of P.D. Review Committee. The Mayor with consent of the
Village Council may establish a P.D. Review Committee for the purposes of
participating in the pre-application meeting. Such a P.D. Review Committee
shall consist of the Village Consultants (legal, planning and engineering); the
Village Building and/or Zoning Officer; at least one member of the Planning and
Zoning Board; and one member of the Village Council. Additional members may be
appointed by the Mayor with consent of the Village Council.
      (3)   Concept plan. For the pre-application meeting, the petitioner
should:
         (a)   Prepare documents describing the nature of the proposed
development and the relationship of the proposed P.D. to adjoining uses, both
existing and planned, and to the topography and natural features of the site
and adjoining lands.
         (b)   Prepare other documents, as recommended. The village may
prepare, publish, and distribute a list of documents and information
recommended for the pre-application meeting. This list may include, but is not
limited to, such items as street and lot layouts, parking, current site
vegetation, and preliminary engineering studies.
         (c)   Forward the recommended documents to the Planning and Zoning
Board Secretary. These documents should be received by the village at least two
days prior to the scheduled pre- application meeting.
      (4)   Review. The P.D. Review Committee shall review the submitted
documents and advise the applicant as to the compatibility of the proposed
development with the comprehensive plan and this chapter. The recommendations
relative to the pre- application review are advisory only, and shall not
constitute a waiver from requirements contained in village ordinances.
      (5)   Additional meetings. The P.D. Review Committee, may request, but
not require, additional pre-application meetings with the applicant. The intent
of such additional meetings should be to ensure that the proposed P.D.
conforms, to the maximum extent possible, with the applicable code provisions,
goals and policies of the village.
      (6)   Report. The Village’s Planning Consultant on behalf of the P.D.
Review Committee may prepare a written summary report of any pre- application
meeting and forward the report to the Planning and Zoning Board and Village
Council.
   (B)   Preliminary development plan.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary development plan is to
obtain a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Board and preliminary
approval by the Village Council that the applicant’s intended development of
land is acceptable and that the applicant can reasonably proceed with
preparation of detailed architecture, engineering, and site and landscape
plans.
      (2)   Submission. An application for approval of a preliminary P.D. plan
shall be filed with the Planning and Zoning Board Secretary. The application
shall include all information and documentation required by this chapter. The
Planning and Zoning Board Secretary shall determine whether the application is
in proper form and shall not consider the application as filed until all
documents are submitted. Upon receipt and filing of the application the
Planning and Zoning Board Secretary will review the application and write a
summary of its contents. This summary should include the proposed P.D.’s
compliance with village ordinances and suggestions and recommendations. The
Planning and Zoning Board Secretary will forward the application with the
summary report to the Planning and Zoning Board.
      (3)   Submittals. See §
15.15.435 below for the materials required for an application for approval of a
preliminary development plan.

shall schedule and hold a public hearing on the application for conditional
permitted use for a P.D. and preliminary development plan. Notice for the
public hearing shall be in accordance with the provisions of §
15.15.450 below. The Planning and Zoning Board shall preserve a record of the
public hearing in such a manner as the Planning and Zoning Board shall, by
rule, prescribe from time to time.
      (5)   Planning and Zoning Board recommendations. The Planning and Zoning
Board shall make written findings of fact and shall submit it together with its
recommendations to the Village Council. Requirements for findings of fact for
planned development applications are explained in §
15.15.440 below.
      (6)   Village Council actions. The Village Council shall review the
Planning and Zoning Board’s findings of fact and recommendations, and following
such review may approve, deny or approve with modification the final
development plan of the proposed P.D.
   (C)   Status of preliminary development plan.
      (1)   Approval of a preliminary development plan shall not constitute
approval of the final plan, nor qualify a plat of the P.D. for recording.
Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval of the preliminary plan as
a guide for preparation of the final plan. Furthermore, the approval of the
preliminary development plan shall vest no rights to the applicants other than
to be able to submit a final development plan.
      (2)   A preliminary development plan which has been granted approval as
submitted, or approval with conditions or modifications, shall not be modified,
revoked or otherwise impaired by action of the village, pending an application
for final approval, without the consent of the applicants, provided that
application for final approval is filed within any time or times that may be
specified in the resolution granting preliminary approval.
   (D)   Final development plan.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of the final plan is to provide a detailed
design for the land to be subdivided, as well as the division of other lands
into common open spaces and building areas, and to more specifically address
land uses and building locations, engineering, and architectural design.
      (2)   Submission. The application for approval of the final development
plan of a P.D. may be submitted in phases. An application for approval of the
final development plan or for a phase of the final development plan shall be
filed with the Planning and Zoning Board Secretary. The application shall
include all information and documentation required by this chapter. Upon
conclusion that the application includes all required documents, the Planning
and Zoning Board Secretary will forward the application to the Planning and
Zoning Board for review and recommendation.
      (3)   Submittals. See §
15.15.435 below for the materials required for an application for approval of a
final development plan.
      (4)   Public meeting. The Planning and Zoning Board shall hold a public
meeting on the application for a conditional permitted use for a P.D. and final
development plan or any phase of the development plan and shall preserve a
record of the proceedings in such a manner as the Planning and Zoning Board
shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
      (5)   Planning and Zoning Board recommendations. The Planning and Zoning
Board shall make written findings of fact and shall submit it together with its
recommendations to the Village Council. Requirements for findings of fact are
explained in §
15.15.440 below.
      (6)   Village Council actions. The Village Council shall review the
Planning and Zoning Board’s findings of fact and recommendations, and following
such review may approve, deny, or approve with modification the final
development plan of the proposed planned P.D. If the final development plan is
approved, the Village Council shall adopt an ordinance authorizing the P.D. as
a conditional permitted use. Supporting documents shall be attached to the
ordinance as exhibits.

easements.
      (2)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural drainage way, channel
or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement, conforming

flooding, unless the water course is improved by deepening or dredging to
provide the same cross-sectional area or flow capacity, in which case the
drainage easement may be narrowed to accommodate the improved water course.
         (a)   The areas within or adjacent to a subdivision site, subject to
flooding or designated on the flood insurance rate map provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to the village, shall be protected, and development

Zoning Board.
      (2)   In manufacturing and business subdivisions, maximum length of
blocks shall be as approved by the Planning and Zoning Board.
      (3)   The shape of blocks shall be determined by topographical features,
the basic street system and traffic pattern, lot depths and areas designated
for public and other non-residential land uses.
      (4)   Where a subdivision borders upon or is traversed by a railroad or
thoroughfare right-of-way, the Village Council may require when recommended by
the Planning and Zoning Board a street on one or both sides of the right-of-
way, located approximately parallel to and at a distance removed suitable for
the appropriate use of the intervening land, i.e. park purposed, deep
residential lots fronting on it with a no-access strip along the rear property
lines, and off-street parking, business or other uses as permitted by zoning
ordinance regulations.

90 feet in width is greater than the width of the typical lot, except the
Village Council may require, when recommended by the Planning and Zoning Board,
a greater lot width to provide for the proper development of intersection
design and traffic safety.
         (c)   Side lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the
street line, or substantially so.

            3.   All materials to be made in the United States of America. The
minimum size for all storm sewers shall be 12 inches.
      (7)   Storm sewer structures.
         (a)   Manholes.
            1.   Location. Manholes are utilized to provide access to
continuous underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and clean-out
and to permit a change in direction, grade and size of sewer: typical locations
where manholes should be specified are:
               a.   Where two or more storm sewers converge;
               b.   At intermediate points along tangent sections;
               c.   Where pipe size changes;
               d.   Where an abrupt change in alignment occurs;
               e.   Where an abrupt change of the grade occurs; and
               f.   Manholes should not be located in traffic lanes; however,
when it is impossible to avoid locating manholes in a traffic lane, care should
be taken to ensure it is not in the normal vehicle path.
            2.   Spacing. The spacing of manholes should be in accordance with
the following:
 
Sizes of Pipe (Inches) Maximum Distance (Feet)
12 to 24               400
27 to 54               600
60 and up              1,000
 
            3.   Types. A manhole, type A (Highway Standard 1527) with
appropriate frame and lid should be provided for the following sewer sizes when
the depth exceeds four feet.
               a.   When the sewer pipe diameter is 18 inches or less, a four-
foot diameter manhole should be provided.
               b.   When the sewer pipe diameter is 21 inches to 42 inches
inclusive, a five-foot diameter manhole should be provided.
               c.   When the sewer pipe diameter is 48 inches or larger, a six-
foot diameter manhole (Standard 2395) or a reinforced concrete pipe tee
(Standard 2263) or a special design manhole should be provided.
            4.   Hydraulic losses. The following criteria should be used to
estimate hydraulic losses in storm sewer manholes.
               a.   Allow a drop of one- tenths foot in a through manhole where
there is no change in the diameter of the sewer pipe.
               b.   Allow a drop of two- tenths foot in the presence of one
lateral or bend.
               c.   Allow a drop of three- tenths foot when two laterals are
present.
               d.   In a through manhole where there is a change in the
diameter of the sewer pipe, no loss should be allowed if eight-tenths foot
depth in each sewer pipe is attained by lowering the larger pipe.
            5.   Pipe connections. The pipe tee and wye connections are
permitted for connecting lateral lines from pavement inlets to main storm sewer
lines provided the following conditions are met:
               a.   Manholes are provided at the required intervals;
               b.   The minimum lateral size is 12 inches or larger; and
               c.   Pre-cast connections are required unless designer verifies
that the structural and hydraulic integrity of mainline sewer is not affected
by field connection.
            6.   Junction chambers. The junction of small sewers is made in
manholes. On occasion, junction chambers of special design are required to
joint two or more converging large size storm sewers. In design, a smooth
transition is essential to prevent turbulence in flow which would cause eddies
and deposition of solids. Normally, junction chambers should not be utilized
when the trunk sewer is less than 42 inches in diameter.
         (b)   Inlets/catch basins.
            1.   Catch basins are drainage structures utilized to collect
surface water through grate or curb openings and convey it to storm sewers or
direct outlet to culverts and ditches. Grate inlets should be provided with
appropriate frames and grates as provided in § B of the Highway Standards. A
Catch Basin Type C should be utilized when the sewer pipe diameter is 15 inches
or less and the depth of pipe is not more than 4 feet. For larger diameter
pipes or where there is both an incoming and outgoing pipe in the inlet, a
larger diameter inlet structure, such as Inlet Type B (Standard 2349) or a
three-foot, four-foot and five-foot diameter catch basin or manhole should be
specified. When such a structure is used in a shallow pipe situation, a pre-
cast reinforced concrete flat slab top, shown on Standard 2354, should be used
in lieu of the standard conically tapered top.
            2.   Catch basins used for the drainage of roadway surfaces shall
be combination catch basins. These catch basins consist of both a curb opening
and a grate inlet acting as a unit.
   (D)   Water supply system.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   No residential, commercial or industrial subdivision, or P.U.D.
shall be approved unless it is served by the village’s water supply system.
         (b)   In the case of any structures, whether residential, commercial
or industrial, constructed prior to the adoption of this chapter and served by
a private well system, the following shall apply:
            1.   As soon as a village water main is contiguous to and available
to serve a structure or an area on a private well system, the owner must
properly abandon the private well system and connect to the village’s public
water supply system within one year of the availability of the public water
supply system.
            2.   All water supply systems which are installed in the public
ways or easements shall be deemed to be dedicated to the village upon
acceptance of the subdivision.
         (c)   Consideration shall be given to water reclamation and reuse in
commercial and industrial tracts for the purpose of conservation and relief of
demands on existing residential supply.
         (d)   Evidence shall be presented by the subdivider that the local
utilities can satisfactorily serve the area by the utility easements shown.
         (e)   There shall be no physical connection between a potable and a
non-potable water supply.
      (2)   Design. Water distribution mains shall be of adequate size and
shall serve the entire development.
         (a)   Design. Water mains shall be designed according to the Standard
Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois or according
to the “Recommended Standard for Water Works,” adopted by the Great Lakes
Mississippi River Board of State Public Health and Environmental Managers. The
more stringent requirements of either shall apply.
         (b)   Installation.
            1.   The mains shall, in general, be installed in the street right-
of-way, but in no case shall mains be installed within 15 feet of a building.
            2.   All water mains shall be installed with a minimum depth of
cover of four and one-half feet, measured from final grade to the top of the
pipe.
            3.   Mains shall be extended to the property line of the
development along public rights-of-way and at any other location indicated by
the Village Engineer.
            4.   All excavation, backfilling, restoration of surfaces, and all
related work shall be completed in accordance with this chapter.

Main Construction in Illinois.
      (2)   Water.
         (a)   Hydrostatic test. After the pipe has been laid and partly
backfilled as specified below, all newly laid pipe or any valved sections of it
shall, unless otherwise expressly specified, be subjected to a hydrostatic
pressure of 100 pounds per square inch. Duration of each pressure test shall be
for a period of not less than one hour for pipes with uncovered joints and not
less than 24 hours for pipes which have been backfilled before tests are made.
            1.   Procedure for test. After all fittings, service connections
and service pipe (to the Buffalo Box) is installed, each valved section of pipe
shall be slowly filled with water and the specified test pressure shall be
applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in a satisfactory manner. The
pump pipe connection and all necessary apparatus including gauges and meters
shall be furnished by the contractor. Before applying the specified test
pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. To accomplish this, taps
shall be made, if necessary, at points of highest elevation and afterwards
tightly plugged. All exposed pipes, fittings, valves, hydrants and joints shall
be carefully examined during the open trench test. All joints showing visible
leaks shall be repaired until tight. Any cracked or defective pipes, fittings,
valves or hydrants discovered in consequence of this pressure test shall be
removed and replaced by the contractor with sound material and the test shall
be repeated until satisfactory to the Village Engineer.
            2.   Permissible leakage.
               a.   Suitable means shall be provided by the contractor for
determining the
quantity of water lost by leakage under the specified test pressure.
               b.   Allowable leakage shall be not greater than computed by the
following table. (Allowable leakage is shown in gallons/hour 1,000 feet.)
Diameter of Pipe Allowable Leakage Diameter of Pipe Allowable Leakage
Diameter of Pipe Allowable Leakage Diameter of Pipe Allowable Leakage
2 inches         0.30              18 inches        2.70

16 inches        2.40              60 inches        9.00
 
               c.   LEAKAGE is defined as the quantity of water to be supplied
in the newly laid pipe or any valved section of it necessary to maintain the
specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and
the air expelled.
               d.   Flanged pipe shall be “bottle tight”.
         (b)   Disinfection of water main.
            1.   Flushing. Sections of pipe to be disinfected shall first be
flushed to remove any solids or contaminated material that may have become
lodged in the pipe. If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, then a
tap should be provided large enough to develop a velocity of at least two and
five-tenths feet per second in the main. One two and one-half inch hydrant
opening will, under normal pressures, provide this velocity in pipe sizes up to
and including 12 inches. All taps required by the contractor for chlorination
or flushing purposes or for temporary or permanent release of air shall be
provided by him or her as a part of the construction of water mains.
            2.   Requirement of chlorine. Before being placed into service, all
new mains and repaired portions of, or extensions to existing mains shall be
chlorinated so that a chlorine residual of not less than ten parts per million
remains in the water after standing 24 hours in the pipe.
            3.   Form of applied chlorine. Chlorine shall be applied by one of
the methods which follow subject to approval by the Village Engineer.
               a.   Liquid chlorine. A chlorine gas-water mixture shall be
applied by means of a solution-feed chlorinating device, or the dry gas may be
fed directly through proper devices for regulating the rate of flow and
providing effective diffusion of the gas into the water within the pipe being
treated. Chlorinating devices for feeding solutions of the chlorine gas, or the
gas itself, must provide means for preventing the backflow of water into the
chlorine.
               b.   Chlorine-bearing compounds in water. A mixture of water and
high-test calcium hypochlorite (65-70% Cl) may be substituted for the chlorine
gas water mixture. The dry powder shall first be mixed as a paste and then
thinned to a 1% chlorine solution by adding water to give a total quantity of
seven and five-tenths gallons of water per pound of dry powder. This solution
shall be injected in one end of the section of main to be disinfected while
filling the main with water in the amounts as shown in the table which follows.
Chlorine Requirements for 100-Foot Lengths of Various Sizes of Pipe

               c.   During the construction of the water main, the contractor
shall, during the installation, place at each joint, approximately one
teaspoonful of H.T.H. 6% chlorine compound or equal.
            4.   Point of application. The preferred point of application of
the chlorinating agent is at the beginning of the pipe line extension of any
valved section of it, and through a corporation stop inserted in the pipe. The
water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe should
be supplied from a tap made on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling
the flow into the pipe line extension. Alternate points of application may be
used when approved or directed by the Village Engineer.
            5.   Rate of application. Water from the existing distribution
system, or other source of supply as approved by the Village Engineer, shall be
controlled to flow very slowly into the newly laid pipe line during application
of the chlorine. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be in such proportion
to the rate of water entering the newly laid pipe that the dosage applied to
the water will be at least 25 parts per million unless otherwise directed by
the Village Engineer.
            6.   Preventing reverse flow. Valves shall be manipulated so that
the strong chlorine solution in the line being treated will not flow back into
the line supplying the water. Check valves may be used if desired.
            7.   Retention period. Treated water shall be retained in the pipe
at least 24 hours. After this period, the chlorine residual at pipe extremities
and at other representative points shall be at least ten parts per million.
            8.   Chlorinating valves and hydrants. In the process of
chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be
operated while the pipe line is filled with the chlorinating agent and under
normal operating pressure.
            9.   Final flushing and testing. Following chlorination, all
treated water shall be thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipe at its
extremity until the replacement water throughout its length shows, upon test,
the absence of chlorine in the event chlorine is normally used in the source of
supply, then the tests shall show a residual not in excess of that carried in
the system. After flushing, water samples collected on two successive days from
the treated piping system, as directed by the Village Engineer, shall show
satisfactory bacteriological results. Bacteriological analysis must be
performed by a laboratory designated and furnished by the owner and approved by
the Director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.
            10.   Repetition of flushing and testing. Should the initial
treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacterial test, the original chlorination
procedure shall be repeated by the contractor until satisfactory results are
obtained.
      (3)   Upon completion of the construction of all sewer and water service
connections with the utility mains, three accurate maps showing the exact
location of all such sewer and water mains, together with manholes, shutoff
valves and similar facilities being part thereof, by distances in feet from
street lines, and of all such service connections in distances in feet from

grading shall be properly completed as shown on the Grading Plan and Approved
by the Village Engineer.
         (c)   After grading of streets and alleys is completed and approved,
and before any base course of the roadway pavement is laid, all of the
underground work, such as water, sewer, and gas mains, house service
connections therewith, and all underground conduits for electric and telephone
lines, shall be completely installed in place and approved.
         (d)   When considered necessary by the Village Engineer, settlement of
all trench backfill shall be accelerated by means of water introduced through
holes jetted into backfilled trenches to a point approximately two feet above
the top of the sewer pipe. The holes shall be jetted not greater than six feet
apart unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer. The jetting process
shall conform to the standards set forth in the State of Illinois Standard
Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, § 66.7. Any depressions which
develop within the street right-of-way due to settlement of backfilling
material shall be refilled and repaved at the subdivider’s expense for the
trenching, in a manner acceptable to the Village Engineer.
         (e)   The surface course of the roadway pavement shall not be laid
until backfilling of all trenches due across the roadway has completely settled
or compacted to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. The trenches shall be
backfilled with suitable material, mechanically tamped in 18-inch lifts, and
brought to the required grade. The surface course shall not be laid until at
least six months after the base course is completed.
         (f)   Corings, at least three per block, on request of the Village
Engineer, shall be taken under village supervision after the paving has been
completed and after the subdivider has requested acceptance of the street.

   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, or of a final
plat of a planned unit development, or on application for permit for mobile
home park, each subdivider or developer of a planned unit development or mobile
home park, will be required to dedicate land for school sites, to serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or make a cash
contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both at the
option of the village with the recommendation of the boards of education of the
school districts affected, in accordance with the criteria and formula set
forth in §§
15.30.010 through
15.30.070.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.010)  (Ord. 261, § 1 (part), passed - -1974)
§ 15.30.010  CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION.
   (A)   Requirement and population ratio.
      (1)   The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or
planned unit development or mobile home park shall bear directly upon the
amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites.
      (2)   The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining
the ratio of estimated children to be served in each school classification over
the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each school
classification as stated herein, and then apply the ratio to the minimum
recommended number of acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for
school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each school
classification, and if cash contribution is elected, apply the number of
required acres of land against the fair market value of the land.
   (B)   School classification and size of school site. School classifications
and size of school sites within the village’s jurisdiction shall be determined
in accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classification By Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Acres of
Grades                   for Each School            Land for Each School Site
                         Classification             Classification
Elementary schools,
grades kindergarten      400 students               15 acres
through 5 (K-5)
Junior high schools,     500 students               25 acres
Grades 6 through 8 (6-8)
Senior high schools,
Grades 9 through 12 (9-  1,000 students             80 acres
12)
 
   (C)   Comprehensive school plan. The comprehensive school plan and/or the
standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline
in locating sites.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.020)  (Ord. 261, § 1(A), passed - -1974; Ord. VG06-412,
passed 8-28-2006)
§ 15.30.015  CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF A SCHOOL SITE.
   (A)   Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to
be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the
village, with the recommendation of the board of education of the school
districts affected, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in
lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village or other public body
designated by the village for use in the acquisition of land for a school site
to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already
serves such needs, or for use in the acquisition of land for a school site or
for the improvement or construction of any existing school buildings or site
made necessary by the additional children from that subdivision or development
in the school district.
   (B)   The formula for determining the required cash contribution in lieu of
a land dedication shall be as follows: minimum number of acres of land for each
school site ÷ maximum number of students for each school classification X
estimated student population per dwelling unit X fair market value of improved
land = cash contribution. By way of example, the following is provided for
future reference.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.030)  (Ord. VG06-412, passed 8-28-2006)
§ 15.30.020  FAIR MARKET VALUE.
   (A)   The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the “fair
market value” of the acres of land in the area improved as specified in this
section, that otherwise would have been dedicated as school sites.
   (B)   It has been determined that the present “fair market value” of the
improved land in and surrounding the village is $55,000 per acre, and the
figure shall be used in making any calculation in this chapter unless the
subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any
objection, the Village Council shall conduct or may direct the Village Planning
and Zoning Board to conduct a public hearing based upon statutory notice for
the purpose of receiving evidence concerning the “fair market value” of the
improved land.
   (C)   The Village Council shall determine the “fair market value” based upon
the evidence at the public hearing. The Village of Gardner, on its own motion
or at the request of an affected school district, may from time to time amend
this provision to provide for a different fair market value.
   (D)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fair market value of the improved
acre of land in and surrounding the Village of Gardner shall automatically
increase on January 1 of each year beginning on January 1, 2007 at a rate of 3%
per year.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.040)  (Ord. VG06-412, passed 8-28-2006)
§ 15.30.025  CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING DEDICATION AND A FEE.
   There will be situations in subdivisions, planned unit developments or
mobile home parks when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in
lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
   (A)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location
for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision, planned
unit development or mobile home park falling within the school location shall
be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof
shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be
dedicated; and/or
   (B)   A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall be required.
(Prior Code, § 16.04.050)  (Ord. 261, (B)(2), passed - -1974)
§ 15.30.030  DENSITY FORMULA.
   The following Table of Population Density is generally indicative of current
and short range projected trends in family size for new construction, and shall
be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land where

land needed beyond the developer’s contribution shall be reserved for
subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designed by the
village; provided, that the acquisition must be made within one year from the
date of approval of the final plat or the issuance of the conditional use
permit.

Appendix A: School Facilities Impact Fee (K–12)
§ 15.35.005  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   It shall hereafter be the policy of the Gardner Village Council of the
Village of Gardner to require the payment of the school facilities impact fees
created herein as a condition of the annexation of residential territory to the
Village of Gardner. Therefore, unless otherwise authorized or directed by the
Gardner Village Council, the annexation of residential territory after the
effective date of this chapter shall be effected pursuant to an annexation
agreement requiring the payment of school facilities impact fees in substantial
accordance with the provisions set forth in
Appendix A below, to compensate the school districts from the development, as a
condition of the issuance of a residential building permit. This chapter shall
have no application to properties that are annexed to the Village of Gardner
for uses other than residential.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.010  AMOUNT OF FEES.
   (A)   The impact fees required hereunder shall be consistent with the table
set forth in
Appendix A to this chapter. The fees shall increase 3% annually on January 1 of
each year, except that the Gardner Village Council reserves the right, by
motion, to reduce the annual increase or completely waive any annual increase
in the sole and unilateral discretion of the Gardner Village Council.
   (B)   As population density, age distribution and local conditions change
over the years, the impact fees reflected in division (B)(1) above shall remain
subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
   (C)   In the event the owner of property annexed to the village files a
written objection to the impact fees reflected in division (A) above, he or she
shall submit evidence to the village in support of the objection. The school
districts shall also be permitted to submit evidence in response to the
objection. The village may make any adjustments it deems necessary.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.015  USE OF FEES.
   The impact fees paid to the affected school districts may be used in each
affected school district’s Operations and Maintenance Fund, Transportation Fund
or Education Fund for any purpose served by the funds.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.020  PAYMENT OF FEES.
   The owner of property annexed to the village shall pay the required school
facilities impact fees directly to the school district designated by the
affected school districts. The school district designated to accept payment
shall issue a receipt for the payment which must be presented to the village
prior to the issuance of a building permit.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.025  ANNUAL REPORT.
   The village shall require an annual report from each school district in
receipt of school facilities impact fees required by this chapter during the
previous fiscal year of the respective school districts. The report shall be
due within 25 business days of the first day of each calendar year, and shall
account for the receipt and expenditure of any impact fees for the previous
fiscal year.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.030  INDEMNIFICATION.
   The school districts, individually and collectively, as a condition of
receiving the impact fees required hereunder, shall indemnify and hold the
Village of Gardner, harmless from and against any loss, claims and causes of
actions of every kind incurred by the village as a result, either directly or
indirectly, of the passage of this chapter, or the administration or
enforcement thereof, including any so incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought
or threatened by the school districts. However, the school districts shall not
be required to indemnify and hold harmless the Village of Gardner from any
loss, claims and causes of actions resulting out of the negligence of the
village. If the village is sued by any owner of property to be annexed as a
result, directly or indirectly, of the passage of this chapter, except as a
result of the negligence of the village, the village, may, at its option,
undertake the defense thereof but all costs and expenses of the defense,
including attorneys fees, shall be immediately reimbursed by the school
districts. Should the school districts improperly use the impact fees as
specified in this chapter, the village may sue the school districts and shall
be entitled to recover as part of the judgment therein, or any settlement
thereof, all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the
village.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.035  COVENANT NOT TO SUE.
   The school districts covenant and agree, as a condition of receiving the
impact fees and in addition to the indemnification provided in this chapter,
not to sue the village for any claims arising, directly or indirectly, out of
the passage of this chapter, or the administration or enforcement thereof.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.040  RESERVATION OF POWERS.
   Nothing herein shall be construed so as to limit, condition or impair the
exercise of powers conferred on the Village of Gardner to annex territory,
enter into annexation agreements, regulate the zoning, subdivision or
development of land, to levy or impose taxes and fees or to exercise other
municipal functions and powers. The establishment of policy herein shall not be
construed as a contract with any party. This chapter may not be enforced by
private action. This chapter is subject to amendment or repeal. The failure to
conform to the policy set forth herein shall not invalidate any official act of
the Village of Gardner, including, but not limited to, the annexation of
territory.
(R07-255, passed 1-22-2007)
§ 15.35.045  MISCELLANEOUS; EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   If any term, condition or provision of this chapter shall be declared
unenforceable, the declaration of unenforceability shall have no bearing or
effect on the remaining parts thereof not so affected.
   (B)   This chapter shall take effect immediately from and following its
passage, approval and publication as required by law.
