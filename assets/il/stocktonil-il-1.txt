frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The village hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax, to be five
percent (5.0%) per annum, based on a year of three hundred sixty five (365)
days and the number of days elapsed.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed, and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to five percent (5%) of the total tax
due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be
filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to file
penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any late
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns
in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of
the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)

Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or

internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-17: REVIEW AND LIEN PROCEDURE:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record, and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling. (Ord. 406, 2-13-2001)
1-15-19: SEVERABILITY:

scheduled administrative hearing to be served not less than ten (10) days prior
to the commencement of the hearing. If the applicant, upon receiving written

   A.   Authority. All full-time, part-time, and auxiliary police officers as
well as other specifically appointed individuals shall have the authority to
issue violation notices.
   B.   Content of Violation Notice. When a Village official with authority to
enforce Village ordinances and code provisions makes a determination that a
violation has occurred, he or she shall note the violation on a multiple copy
violation notice and report form that indicates (i) the name and address of the
defendant, (ii) the type and nature of the violation, including the section or
regulation violated, (iii) the date and time the violation was observed, (iv)
the names of witnesses to the violation, (v) the signature and identification
number, if applicable, of the person issuing the violation notice and in the
case of vehicular standing, parking or compliance regulations certification
shall be valid if the authorized person issuing the notice signs the notice at
the time of service, (vi) a hearing date along with the time and location of
the hearing, (vii) if applicable, the amount of the fine and notice that the
failure to pay the fine within the allotted time will result in adjudication of

   C.   Content of Violation Notice for Ordinance Violations Related to Vehicle

there shall be a section entitled “request for hearing” setting forth that the
registered owner or lessee may appear at the initial administrative hearing to
contest the validity of the violation notice on the date and at the time and
place as specified in the violation notice by:
      1.   Checking or placing a mark in a space provided and clearly
identified “request for hearing”;
      2.   If a non-resident of the Village of Stockton or Jo Daviess County,

“non-resident request for hearing - nonappearance”;
      3.   Placing his name and current address in the place provided;
      4.   Signing his name in the appropriate indicated place;
      5.   Filing the violation notice, with the request for hearing portion
fully completed, with the Ordinance Enforcement Administrator postmarked by the
25th of the month, if the violation notice was issued between the first through
the 15th day of the month, or postmarked by the tenth of the month, if the
violation notice was issued between the 16th and the end of the prior month.
The request shall be deemed filed upon receipt by the Ordinance Enforcement
Administrator; and
      6.   A clearly marked statement that execution of the non-resident
request for hearing is a waiver of the non-resident’s right to a personal
appearance and that the adjudication will be made based upon the notarized
statement of facts submitted by the non resident and the facts contained in the
violation notice.
   D.   The violation report derived from the violation notice form shall be
forwarded to the code hearing division where a docket number shall be stamped
on all copies of the report and a hearing date shall be noted or filled in. The
hearing date shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than forty (40) days
after the notice is served. One copy of the violation notice and report form
shall be maintained in the files of the code hearing division and shall be part
of the record of the hearing; one copy of the report form shall be returned to
the individual representing the Village in the case so that he or she may
prepare evidence of the code violation for presentation at the hearing on the
date indicated; and one copy of the report form shall be served either in
person or by first class mail to the defendant along with a summons commanding
the defendant to appear at the hearing. Hand delivery of the violation notice
containing the required content shall be sufficient for in person service.
Service of a violation notice may be made by affixing the original or a
facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully standing or parked vehicle.
   E.   Parties may request in writing to the hearing officer before the
hearing date that the hearing officer issue subpoenas to direct attendance and
testimony of relevant witnesses and the production of relevant documents.
   F.   At the hearing, parties shall be provided with an opportunity to give
testimony, present witnesses, submit evidence, and cross-examine opposing
witnesses. Parties may be represented by legal counsel. (Ord. 714, 8-10-2021)
5-7-5: PRIMA FACIE CASE; RULES OF EVIDENCE; STANDARD OF PROOF:
   A.   A prima facie case may be established if the violation notice served in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter is certified by the issuer. A
violation notice shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal
proceeding.
   B.   The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the
adjudicatory hearing process. Any evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted,
but only if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons
in the conduct of their affairs.
   C.   The burden of proof required to sustain a finding of a violation of
Village ordinances shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. (Ord. 714, 8-
10-2021)
5-7-6: SUBPOENAS AND DEFAULTS:
At any time prior to the hearing date, but not less than two (2) working days
prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer assigned to hear the case may,
at the request of either party, direct witness to appear and give testimony at
the hearing. If, on the date set for hearing, the defendant, or his or her
attorney fails to appear, the hearing officer may find the defendant in default
and shall proceed with the hearing and accept evidence relevant to the
existence of a code violation in the defendant’s absence. (Ord. 714, 8-10-2021)
5-7-7: CONTINUANCES:
No continuance shall be authorized by the hearing officer except in cases in
which a continuance is necessary to protect the rights of the parties. Lack of
preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. (Ord. 714, 8-10-2021)
5-7-8: FINDINGS, DECISION, ORDER, AND PENALTY:
   A.   At the conclusion of a hearing, the hearing officer shall make a
determination, on the basis of the relevant and competent evidence presented at
the hearing, whether or not a code or ordinance violation exists. The
determination shall be in writing and shall be designated as findings, decision
and order. The findings, decision and order shall include the hearing officer’s
findings of fact, a decision whether or not a code or ordinance violation
exists based upon the findings of fact, and an order.
   B.   If a violation is found, the order shall impose a fine and costs and
may direct the defendant to correct the violation and/or impose such other
sanction as may be appropriate as allowed by law consistent with Village
ordinance; set a date by which the violation must be brought into compliance,
if applicable. The order shall contain a statement of the penalties for late
payment and that any unpaid fines, costs, and penalty assessed is a debt due
and owing the Village after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust
judicial procedures for review. In the case in which a defendant fails to
comply with a judgment ordering the correction of a code violation or imposing
any fine or other sanction as a result of the code violation, the order shall
provide that any expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the judgment,
including, but not limited to, attorney fees, costs, and costs related to
property demolition or foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing the Village
and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. If a violation is not
found, the order shall include a statement to that effect and dismiss the case.
A copy of the findings, decision and order shall be served on the owner within
five days after issuance by first class mail.
   C.   A notice of judgment entered by default shall be forwarded to any
person who fails to appear and shall contain the same information as a
determination of liability but shall also state that the judgment may be set
aside by the hearing officer if, within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the
judgment, a petition is received stating what the hearing officer determines is
good cause for failure to appear. The default judgment shall state that it
constitutes a final determination of liability if such petition is not
received, if the petition is denied, or after setting a new hearing date, the
person fails to appear.
   D.   The hearing officer shall not have the authority to impose a penalty of
incarceration or impose a fine in excess of Seven Hundred Fifty and No/100's
Dollars, ($750.00), for each violation except for those offenses under 625 ILCS
5/11-208.3 which shall carry a maximum fine of Five Hundred and No/100's
Dollars, ($500.00). When applicable, however, each day a code provision is
found to have been violated by the defendant shall constitute a separate
offense, and each separate offense subjects the defendant to the fine and
penalty provided by the governing fine or penalty provision. Any fine assessed
is exclusive of any costs imposed. In all cases where there is a determination
of liability by the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall impose
administrative costs (i.e., court costs) in the amount of Twenty-Five and No/
100's Dollars, ($25.00), or greater.
   E.   In addition, and notwithstanding any fines and administrative costs,
the hearing officer may order:
      1.   Costs incurred by the Village for effecting compliance with code
provision(s) for which a defendant has been found to be liable;
      2.   Compliance with the code provision(s) found to have been violated;
and
      3.   Performance of a term of community service in lieu of fines.
   F.   For all vehicular standing, parking or compliance regulation
violations, there shall be a second notice sent following a failure to appear
at the hearing. In addition, a notice of final determination shall be sent
following an appearance by the violator and a determination of liability or the
failure to appear by the violator by the final hearing date upon conclusion of
any judicial review. The notice shall contain, but not be limited to, the
following information:
      1.   The date and location of violation cited in the vehicular standing,
parking or compliance regulation violation notice;
      2.   The particular standing, parking or compliance regulation violated;
      3.   The vehicle make and state registration;
      4.   The fine, court costs, and any penalty that may be assessed for late
payment;
      5.   A notice to the registered owner or lessee of their current status,
other than paid in full;
      6.   The date, time and place of the administrative hearing at which the
alleged violation may be contested on its merits if the individual failed to
appear at his or her first hearing date;
      7.   A statement that failure to either pay the fine and any applicable
penalty or failure to appear at the hearing on its merits on the date and at
the time and place specified will result in a final determination of vehicle
standing, parking, or compliance regulation violation liability for the cited
vehicle violation in the amount of the fine and penalty indicated as well as
court costs;
      8.   If a final determination occurs, a statement that a final
determination of vehicular standing, parking or compliance violation liability
for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust judicial
procedures for review, any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due
and owing the Village;
      9.   A warning that failure to pay the fine and any penalty due and owing
the Village within the time specified may result in the Village’s filing a
complaint in the Circuit Court to have the unpaid fine or penalty rendered a
judgment as provided herein; and
      10.   A warning that failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within
forty-five (45) days of the date of the notice may result in the Village
notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of
suspension proceedings under 625 ILCS 5/6-306.5 if they have failed to pay any
fine or penalty due and owing as a result of ten (10) or more vehicular
standing, parking or compliance regulation violations.
   G.   A notice of impending suspension of a person’s driver’s license shall
be sent to any person determined to be liable for the payment of any fine or
penalty that remains due and owing on ten (10) or more vehicular standing,
parking or compliance regulation violations. The notice shall state that the
failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within forty-five (45) days of the
date of the notice will result in the Village notifying the Secretary of State
that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under 625
ILCS 5/6-306.5. The notice of impending driver’s license suspension shall be
sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the
Secretary of State.
   H.   Notices shall be sent to the registered owner of the cited vehicle at
the address as is recorded with the Secretary of State or sent to the lessee of
the cited vehicle at the address last known to the lessor of the cited vehicle
at the time of the lease by first class mail, postage prepaid.
   I.   Notices not related to vehicular standing, parking or compliance
regulations shall be sent to the last known address of the individual by first
class mail, postage prepaid. (Ord. 714, 8-10-2021)
5-7-9: LATE FEES:
Failing to pay the total fines and costs within twenty-one (21) days of the
issuance of the determination of liability and the exhaustion of or the failure
to exhaust any administrative review procedures as set forth in this chapter
shall result in the imposition of a late payment penalty fee as follows:
   A.   A late payment penalty fee of Fifty and No/100's Dollars, ($50.00),

   A.   Any fine, costs or other sanction imposed that remains unpaid after the
exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law, shall be considered a debt due and owing to
the Village and enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees, court costs, and costs related

Village and may be collected in accordance with applicable law. However, prior
to any expenses being fixed by a hearing officer, the Village shall provide
notice to the defendant that states that the defendant shall appear at a
hearing before the administrative hearing officer to determine whether the
defendant has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date

its effective date. (Ord. 714, 8-10-2021)

inflow or infiltration to enter the sewer system or which would result in an
unacceptable risk of blockages. The Superintendent shall have the sole
discretion to determine when repair and/or replacement is required due to
unacceptable conditions of a building sewer. A building sewer shall be
considered in compliance with the provisions of this chapter if inspection
verifies all of the following conditions to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent:
         a.   The building sewer is free of roots, deposits of fat, oil and
grease (FOG) and/or solids which may impede or obstruct the flow of sewage;
         b.   There are no illicit or illegal connections to the building sewer
which would cause inflow, such as roof leaders, sump pumps or yard drains;
         c.   All joints in the building sewer are tight and sound to prevent
the exfiltration of sewage or infiltration of groundwater;
         d.   The building sewer is free of structural defects, cracks, breaks,
or missing portions and the grade is reasonably uniform without major sags or
offsets;
         e.   The building sewer is equipped with cleanouts, if required, as
determined by the Superintendent;
         f.   The building sewer is constructed of materials that are corrosive
resistant, nonabsorbent, durable, and with a remaining design life of at least
twenty five (25) years. "Orangeburg pipe", a bituminized fiber pipe made from
layers of wood pulp and pitch pressed together, shall be considered to be at
the end of its design life and not compliant with the provisions of this
chapter.
      2.   Owner's Duty To Make Connection: When any street or alley is ordered
to be paved or otherwise permanently improved, it shall be the duty of all
owners of property abutting upon such street or alley upon written notice of
the Village to at once make permanent and substantial connections meeting the
conditions listed within this chapter with sewer, along such street or alley at
their own expense. The Village shall order such connections made as are
necessary, stating generally the location of the street, and the kind and
character of connections to be made with the kind of materials to be used and
when the work of making such connections shall be completed.
      3.   Notice To Connect: In case any property owner or title holder fails
to make such connections within the time allotted within the provided notice
for the improvements of any such street or alley, the Village may order the
same and cause the Superintendent to prepare notices to such delinquent
property owners to make such connections within ten (10) days thereafter. The
notices shall be mailed by certified mail to the last known address of the
property owner or personally served on the property owner. The Superintendent
may at their option, also publish notice in an newspaper in the Village stating
the particular lot or lots or parcel of ground in front of which connections
shall be made.
      4.   Completion Of Work: The Village shall include the connections the
property owner fails to make within the capital improvement project.
      5.   Connections made By The Village: If any owner of abutting property
fails to comply with the provisions of this section by the time stated in the
notice to connect, the Village may proceed to have such connections made under
the supervision and direction of the Superintendent, and keep accurate account
of the expenses incurred.
      6.   Assessment: The Village shall send a statement of total expense
incurred, by certified mail, to the last known address of the property owner
who has failed to abide by the notice to connect. If the amount shown on the
statement is not paid within thirty (30) days of mailing, the cost and expenses
of putting in connections by the Village as provided herein shall be levied as
a special tax against the property abutting or adjacent thereto and the method
of estimating, assessing, levying and collecting the tax shall be the same as
the prescribed for general taxes.
      7.   Excavations After Pavement Laid: Whenever any street or alley has
been ordered to be paved, and the property owners owning property abutting or
lying along such street or alley, have been notified by the Village to connect
their property by laying down pipes within the right of way in front of or
along the property, any person so notified who has refused to comply with the
requirements of the notice shall not enter upon such street or alley after it
has been paved and make excavation in the paved portion of thereof for the
purpose of connecting their property with such mains within four (4) years
after such paving is laid and not thereafter within written authorization by
the Village. (Ord. 383, 6-23-1999; amd. Ord. 651, 5-8-2018; Ord. 702, 12-8-

described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the Superintendent that such wastes can harm either the sewers,
sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of
the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant, and maximum limit established by regulatory agencies. The

similar objectionable or toxic substances; or wastes exerting an excessive
chlorine requirement to such a degree that any such material received in the
composite sewage of the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established
by the Superintendent for such materials.
      The Superintendent will evaluate each toxic or objectionable substance
waste on a concentration-dilution basis and will establish maximum allowable
discharge concentrations for each individual person to protect against the
following:
         a.   Decrease sewage plant treatment process efficiencies and degraded
effluent qualities exceeding the current requirements of the regulatory
agencies.
         b.   Concentrations of any toxic or objectionable substance in the
sewage treatment plant effluent exceeding the current maximum limits
established by the regulatory agencies for such plant effluent flows.
         c.   Any concentrations of toxic or objectionable substances in the
plant effluent flows which will result in concentrations of such substances in
the receiving waters which will exceed the regulatory agency's maximum
allowable limits for these substances in the receiving water.
      6.   Any waters or wastes containing phenols, or other taste or odor-
producing substances, in such concentrations exceeding limits which may be
established by the Superintendent as necessary, after treatment of composite
sewage, to meet the requirements of the State, Federal or other public agencies
of jurisdiction for such drainage to receiving waters.
      7.   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Superintendent in the
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      8.   Any waters having a pH in excess of nine and five-tenths (9.5).
      9.   Any mercury or any of the compounds in excess of 0.0005 mg/l of Hg
at any time except as permitted by the Superintendent in compliance with
applicable state and federal regulations.
      10.   Any cyanide in excess of one-tenth milligram per liter (0.1 mg/l)
at any time except as permitted by the Superintendent in compliance with
applicable State and Federal regulations.
      11.   Materials which exert or cause:
         a.   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         b.   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions)
         c.   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements, in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         d.   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting
slugs as defined herein.
      12.   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amendable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed or are
amendable to treatment only to such a degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   E.   Additional prohibited discharges for industrial users are outlined in
chapter 13 of this title.
   F.   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, in which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection D or subsection E of this
section and/or which are in violation of the standards for pretreatment
provided in 40 CFR 403, June 26, 1978, and any amendments thereto, and which in
the judgement of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the
sewage treatment works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Superintendent may:
      1.   Reject the wastes and require the violator to cease and desist
discharging said materials into the sewer system immediately.
      2.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers, as outlined above and in chapter 13 of this title.
      3.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
      4.   Require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treatment
of the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the
provisions of subsection
8-8-1B of this title.
      If the Superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Superintendent, subject to the requirements
of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   G.   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand or
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   H.   Where preliminary treatment of flow-equalizing facilities are provided
for any water or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   I.   Requirements for the installation of monitoring facilities by
industrial users are outlined in chapter 13 of this title.
   J.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory analysis results required per
chapter 13 of this title.
   K.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of the IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual
of Laboratory methods, and shall be determined at the monitoring facility
provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said monitoring facility.
      1.   In the event that no monitoring facility has been required, the
monitoring facility shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in
the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
      2.   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls on a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites from all outfalls, whereas
pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.
      Any person discharging wastes having concentrations greater than the
normal concentrations as set forth herein shall upon notification by the
approving authority, install a composite sampler with a compatible pacing
(metering) device for monitoring said substances. The pacing and sampling
devices shall be of the type approved by the Superintendent. (Ord. 383, 6-23-
1999)
      Additional sampling and laboratory analysis requirements for industrial
users are outlined in chapter 13 of this title.
   L.   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard
(NCPS) for a particular industrial user, the said standard, if more stringent
than the limitations imposed upon chapter 13 of this title for sources in that
category, shall, when effective, immediately supersede the limitations and
conditions imposed under chapter 13 of this title and said standard shall be
complied with by all industrial users subject to said national categorical
pretreatment standards.
   M.   Per chapter 13 of this title, industrial users shall not dilute process
water as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with a discharge limitation.
   N.   Each user having the ability to cause interference with the sewage
treatment plant or to violate the regulatory provisions of this chapter shall
provide protection from accidental discharge to the sewage treatment plant of
prohibited materials or other substances that may impact the ability of the
sewage treatment plant to adequately treat wastewater. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner's cost and expense.
      1.   Immediate Notification: In the case of an accidental or intentional
discharge of materials which may cause interference or pass through at the POTW
or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the Village wastewater treatment plant
of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller, location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective action taken.
      2.   Written Report: Within fifteen (15) days of an accidental or
intentional discharge, the user shall submit to the Village a detailed written
report on forms to be provided by the Village, describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Follow up reports may be required by the Village. Such a report,
or reports, shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills,
or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by
this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or intentional
discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the Village;
result in the revocation of the user's individual wastewater discharge permit.
      3.   Notice To Employees: Signs shall be permanently posted in
conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in
the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all
employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency
notification procedures..
      4.   Additional Remedies: In addition to the remedies set forth
elsewhere, if the Village is fined by the IEPA or USEPA for violation of the
NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as a result of the users
discharge of an incompatible pollutant, then the fine, including all Village
legal, sampling, analytical testing costs and any other related costs shall be
charged to the responsible user. Such charge, shall be in addition to, not in
lieu of, any other charges.
      5.   The user shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of it's pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies to the situation, where among other things, the primary source of power
is reduced, lost or fails. (Ord. 383, 6-23-1999; amd. Ord. 651, 5-8-2018; Ord.
702, 12-8-2020)
8-7-6: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Village and an industrial user.
The Village reserves the right to enter into special agreement with an
industrial user setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the
POTW. This may include the Village accepting industrial waste of unusual
strength or character. Sewer/wastewater treatment charges for industrial users
shall be set in accordance with title 8, chapter 8, or as outlined in said
special agreement. All charges shall be in accordance with Federal and State
guidelines for user charge systems.
Additional requirements for industrial users discharging to the Village
sanitary sewer system are included in chapter 13 of this title. (Ord. 651, 5-8-
2018; amd. Ord. 702, 12-8-2020)

8-8-1: RATES AND CHARGES ESTABLISHED:
There shall be and there are hereby established separate water and wastewater
rates and charges for the use of and for the services supplied by the combined
waterworks and sewerage systems of the Village, based upon the amount of water
consumed as recorded and/or sewage meters as follows:
   A.   Water Service Charge
      1.   For water service charges:
         a.   For service up to and including two hundred thousand (200,000)
gallons per month, the water service charge per month shall be as follows:
 
For the first 1,000 gallons  @ $27.93 (minimum charge or “base” rate)
All over first 1,000 gallons @ $0.40 per 100 gallons
 
         b.   For the service over two hundred thousand (200,000) gallons per
month, the water service charge per month shall at minimum, one-dollar ($1.00)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons, not to exceed the per gallon rate shown in
subsection Ala of this section: subject to annual adjustment on May 1 of each
year.
      2.   The water minimum charge or “base” rate shown above shall be subject
to an annual increase on May 1 of each year according to the percentage
increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), said increase not to be greater
than five percent (5%) nor less than two percent (2%).
   B.   Non-Industrial Wastewater Service Charges:
      1.   General: The wastewater service charge shall consist of a basic user
charge, debt service charge, and an administrative service charge and or
surcharge, if applicable.
      The fixed administrative service charge is for administrative expenses of
the wastewater system and is computed by dividing the budgeted fixed
administrative costs by the number of users. Through further division, the
monthly fixed administrative charges can be computed.
      The basic user charge is for debt service retirement, operation,
maintenance and replacement expenses and is based upon water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
domestic concentrations:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty-degree centigrade (20°C) Biochemical
Oxygen Demand (BOD5) concentration of two hundred twenty milligrams per liter
(220 mg/L).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) concentration of two hundred forty
milligrams per liter (240 mg/L)
         c.   A total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration of forty-five
milligrams per liter (45 mg/L).
      The basic user charge is computed by multiplying the water/wastewater
volume in one thousand (1,000) gallons by a basic user rate which is computed
as follows:
         a.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required for principal and
interest payment of all outstanding sewage revenue bonds and loans.
         b.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities including equipment replacement.
         c.   Estimate the billable wastewater volume
         d.   Compute the costs (rate) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of
billable volume.
      A surcharge will be levied to all commercial or residential users whose
wastes exceed the normal domestic concentrations for BOD (220 milligrams per
liter), SS (240 milligrams per liter), and TKN (45 milligrams per liter), or to
all industrial users whose wastes exceed the limits identified within the
pretreatment agreement as referenced herein. The surcharge will be based on
water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes
which exceed the limitations herein stipulated. Subsection B6 of this section
specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
      The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually
and shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service, a change
in the fixed administrative costs, or a change in operation and maintenance
costs including equipment replacement.
      The users of wastewater treatment services will be notified annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user
charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation,
maintenance and replacement.
      2.   Measurement of flow:
         a.   The volume of flow used for computing the basic user charges and
surcharges shall be metered water consumption read to the lowest even increment
of one thousand (1,000) gallons.
         b.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures
any part, or all, of his/her water from sources other than the public
waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain, at his/her expense, water meters of a
type approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume
of water obtained from these other sources.
         c.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined
from the metered water consumption records.
         d.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Superintendent.
      3.   Administrative Service Charge:
         a.   In recognition of the need to acquire (and accumulate) additional
funds for payment of permitting fees, if any, billed to the Village by the
IEPA, the sewer rate schedule shall be adjusted and there is hereby imposed on
all users of the Municipal sewer system and services, an additional amount for
each user’s pro rate or proportionate share of the total of such fees billed to
the Village on a periodic basis by the IEPA.
      4.   Basic User Charge: There shall be and there is hereby established a
minimum charge and a basic user rate for the use of and for service supplied by
the wastewater facilities of the Village.
         a.   A basic user rate of ten dollars and twenty cents ($10.20) per
one thousand (1,000) gallons for the first one thousand (1,000) gallons shall
be applied to metered water users with one thousand (1,000) gallons being the
minimum. Above 1,000 gallons, the rate shall be fifty cents ($0.50) per one
hundred (100) gallons.
         b.   The basic user rate, including both the rate for minimum usage
and rate for usage above minimum as identified above, and shall be subject to
an annual increase on May 1 of each year according to the percentage increase
in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), said increase not to be greater than five
percent (5%) nor less than two percent (2%).
         c.   Debt Service Charge: a debt service charge of fifteen dollars
($15.00) per user per month shall be applied to all non-industrial sewage
generators starting January 1, 2021.
            (1)   Starting January 1, 2022, the Debt Service Charge will
increase to a total of thirty dollars ($30.00) per user per month.
            (2)   Starting January 1, 2024, the Debt Service Charge will
increase to a total of forty two dollars and fifty cents ($42.50) per user per
month.
         d.   All non-metered residential users of the wastewater facilities
shall pay the Debt Service Charge and basic user charge identified above and a
flat rate charge per month with the assumption that 4,000 gallons of sewage has
been generated. Current rates identified above are used to calculate the flat
rate charge, and are subject to CPI increases as outlined above.
 
Basic User Rate for First 1,000 gallons $10.20 per month
Service for 3,000 gallons               $15.00 per month
Debt Service Charge                     $30.00 per month
Total flat rate                         $55.20 per month
 
   Rates are further subject to base rate and debt service rate increases as
outlined above.
         e.   In the event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by
the Superintendent to be in excess of four thousand (4,000) gallons per month,
they may require such flat rate users to install appropriate metering devices
to measure the amount of service supplied.
      5.   Surcharge Rate: The rates of surcharge for BOD5, SS, and TKN shall
be as follows:
 
a.   For biochemical oxygen demand (BO$0.70 per pound
b.   For suspended solids (SS)        $0.30 per pound
c.   For total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN)$1.36 per pound
 
      6.   Computation of Surcharge: The surcharge per user shall be computed
by the following formula:
S = V (0.00834) [A(BOD5-220) + B(SS-240) + C(TKN-45)]
Where:
 S       = Amount of surcharge ($) per day
 V       = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per day
 0.00834 = Unit weight of water x 106 per thousand gallons
 A       = Unit charge of BOD5 strength (See subsection B5a of this section)
 BOD5    = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater (mg/L)
 220     = Allowable BOD5 strength
 B       = Unit charge for SS per pound (see subsection B5b of this section)
 SS      = Suspended solids concentration of wastewater (mg/L)
 240     = Allowable SS (mg/L)
 C       = Unit charge for TKN per pound (see subsection B5c of this section)
 TKN     = Total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration of wastewater (mg/L)
 45      = Allowable TKN strength
 
      Each calendar day in which any discharge is not compliant with the
limitations shall be deemed a separate occurrence. Some tests may not occur
daily. If no tested sample is taken that day, then the last tested sample shall
be used for that day.
      7.   Computation of Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service
charge per user shall be computed by the following formula:
 
WC = A + (V)(R) + S
Where:
 WC = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period
 A  = Fixed administrative service charge (see subsection B3a of this section)
 V  = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period, but never less
       than 2,000 gallons
 R  = Basic user rate for debt service, operation, maintenance and replacement
       (see subsection B4 of this section)
 S  = Amount of surcharge (see subsection B5 and B6 of this section)
 
   C.   Industrial Wastewater Service Charges: Industrial users shall be
subject to at least the following wastewater service charges:
      1.   Wastewater System Capital Improvement. The cost for wastewater
system capital improvement projects shall be distributed to all industrial and
non-industrial users. The Village shall require payments from industrial users
that are proportional to each industrial user’s allocated capacity following
completion of said project(s). Industrial user costs associated with wastewater
system capital improvement projects shall be detailed within an Agreement
between the industrial user and Village.
      2.   Replacement. Some financing options for wastewater system capital
improvement projects require a replacement/ depreciation account. The payments
to be allocated to said account shall be distributed to all industrial and non-
industrial users. The Village shall require payments from industrial users that
are proportional to each industrial user’s allocated capacity following
completion of said project(s). Industrial user costs associated with potential
replacement/ depreciation accounts shall be detailed within an Agreement
between the industrial user and Village.
      3.   Debt Service Reserve Account. Some financing options for wastewater
system capital improvement projects require a debt service reserve account. The
payments to be allocated to said account shall be distributed to all industrial
and non-industrial users. The Village shall require payments from industrial
users that are proportional to each industrial user’s allocated capacity
following completion of said project(s). Industrial user costs associated with
potential debt service reserve accounts shall be detailed within an Agreement
between the industrial user and Village.
      4.   Fixed Operations and Maintenance. Costs incurred by the Village
associated with operations and maintenance activities that are not expected to
change significantly from year to year are stated as Fixed Operations and
Maintenance costs. These costs shall be distributed to all industrial and non-
industrial users. Each industrial user shall be responsible for the percentage
of the annual Fixed Operations and Maintenance costs incurred by the Village
that is proportional to their allocated capacity.
         8.33 percent or one twelfth of the Fixed Operations and Maintenance
costs incurred by the Village from the prior fiscal year shall be multiplied by
an industrial user’s allocated capacity to determine that industrial user’s
monthly Fixed Operations and Maintenance charge for the upcoming year. At the
conclusion of a year of charges, the Village will determine the actual Fixed
Operations and Maintenance costs incurred and either issue each industrial user
a credit for any payments made in excess of actual costs or bill for additional
charges owed.
      5.   Variable Operations and Maintenance. Costs incurred by the Village
associated with operations and maintenance activities that are expected to
fluctuate from year to year are stated as Variable Operations and Maintenance
costs. These costs shall be distributed to all industrial and non-industrial
users based on actual wastewater parameter sampling results.
   Industrial users shall be charged variable operations and maintenance costs
monthly based on the 30-day running average monitoring results for flowrate,
Ammonia, BODs, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and TKN. The below table shows the
variable operations and maintenance rates as of the publication date of this
ordinance. These variable operations and maintenance rates are subject to
change by the Village through a resolution.
 
Parameter        Variable Operations and Maintenance Rate
Flowrate         $0.07 per 1,000 gal
Ammonia          $0.17 per lb
BOD5             $0.07 per lb
TSS              $0.16 per lb
TKN              $0.41 per lb
Total Phosphorus $2.05 per lb
 
      6.   Surcharges. Industrial users with discharges above the 30-day
running average limit listed in their permit for flowrate, Ammonia, BODs, TSS,
and TKN are required to pay monthly surcharges. Surcharges will only be charged
for the amount by which a parameter exceeds the 30-day running average limit.
The below table shows the surcharge rates as of the publication date of this
ordinance. These surcharge rates are subject to change by the Village through a
resolution.
 
Parameter        Surcharge Rate
Flowrate         7 times the Variable Operations and Maintenance Rate
Ammonia          6 times the Variable Operations and Maintenance Rate
BOD5             7 times the Variable Operations and Maintenance Rate
TSS              4 times the Variable Operations and Maintenance Rate

application.
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and resubmit
the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is
sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The Village
shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial shall
require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the Village's review period.
The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted
with the revised application.
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited
in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure
requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         e.   Pole Attachment Agreement: Within thirty (30) days after an
approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a Municipal utility
pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment
Agreement, provided by the Village for the initial collocation on a Municipal
utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate
on a small wireless facility on a Municipal utility pole, the Village and the
applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment
Agreement.
      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable Village Code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the Village by personal
delivery at the Village's designated place of business, by regular mail
postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including
electronic mail.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village's
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Electrical Distribution Or Transmission System: The wireless
provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on Village utility poles
that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on the
top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Public Safety: The wireless provider shall comply with all
applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public
safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive
plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the
rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the Village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for an Administrative Waiver with the Village Board of Trustees.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility
pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights- of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection B1d of this section; or
         c.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately-owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: a) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this chapter.
   F.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the Village
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the Village's
utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before the
wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this
paragraph.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the
wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole.
If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   H.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider. (Ord. 659, 8-14-2018)
8-12-4: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of Jo Daviess shall have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve
all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act.
Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
Village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal
utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 659, 8-14-2018)
8-12-5: INDEMNIFICATION:
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right- of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 659, 8-14-2018)
8-12-6: INSURANCE:
The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   A.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
   B.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
   C.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection
limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village improvements
or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability policy prior to
the collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self- insure the
insurance coverage limits required by the Village. (Ord. 659, 8-14-2018)

Village to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws, including the
Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR Part 403). The objectives of this chapter are:
   A.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will
interfere with its operation;
   B.   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will pass
shrough the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be
incompatible with the POTW;
   C.   To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and
sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
   D.   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge from
the POTW;
E.   To enable the Village to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other Federal or State laws to which the POTW is subject.
   This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. The chapter authorizes
the issuance of individual wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring,
compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review
procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for
the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established
herein. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-1-2: ADMINISTRATION:

(Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-2-2: NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR
chapter I, subchapter N, parts 405 through 471.
   A.   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the public
works coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
   B.   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the public works
coordinator may, as per 40 CFR 403.6(c)(2), convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or
effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations
applicable to individual industrial users. Once included in its permit, the
industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in lieu
of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent
limitations were derived.
   C.   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed
with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the public works
coordinator may impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   D.   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
   E.   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four (4) day average, limitations.
Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure
shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent
limitation, as per 40 CFR 403.6(c)(8). (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-2-3: DEADLINE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE NATIONAL CATEGORICAL
PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
Compliance by existing sources covered by categorical pretreatment standards
shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a
shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The Village
shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not
covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when
the local limits for said user are more restrictive than the federal
categorical pretreatment standards.
New sources and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety (90) days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install, have
in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain
a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in the USEPA's
categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical
user that must comply with a more stringent local limit and is in non-
compliance with any local limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule
placed in an industrial wastewater permit to ensure compliance within the
shortest time feasible. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-2-4: STATE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
State requirements and limitations shall be met by all users which are subject
to such standards if they are more stringent than Federal requirement and
limitations or this chapter. State requirements and limitations are included in
the IAC title 35, subtitle C, chapter I, part 310. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)

   Discharges in excess of the pollutant limits detailed in this section shall
be subject to enforcement actions and other penalties outlined in this chapter,
individual wastewater discharge permits, and industrial user agreements.
   D.   The local limits detailed in this section apply at the point where the
wastewater is discharged to the POTW unless dilution beyond typical domestic
flows occurs between the end of the process/pretreatment and discharge to the
POTW. If significant dilution occurs local limits will apply at the point where
the process/pretreatment ends.
      All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metals unless
indicated otherwise. The Village may impose mass limitations in addition to the
concentration-based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more
stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.
      Compliance with the above local limits shall be required no later than
three hundred and sixty five (365) days following the effective date of this
chapter.
   E.   The Village may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance
or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and
the requirements of section
8-13-2-1. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020; amd. Ord. 780, 12-10-2024)
8-13-2-6: RIGHT OF REVISION:
The Village reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in individual
wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on
discharges to the POTW consistent with the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 701,
12-8-2020)
8-13-2-7: SPECIAL AGREEMENT:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the Village and an industrial user.
The Village reserves the right to enter into special agreement with an
industrial user setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the
POTW. This may include the Village accepting industrial waste of unusual
strength or character. Sewer/wastewater treatment charges for industrial users
shall be set in accordance with title 8, chapter 8, or as outlined in said
special agreement. All charges shall be in accordance with Federal and State
guidelines for user charge systems.
Acceptance of industrial waste per special agreement shall in no case waive
compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or Federal pretreatment
requirement. However, users may request a net/gross adjustment to a categorical
standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance
from the categorical pretreatment standard from the administrator in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.13. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-2-8: DILUTION:
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to
dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized
by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The Village may impose
mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition
of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-3: PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER:
8-13-3-1: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES:
All significant industrial users, unless deemed unnecessary by the public works
coordinator, shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in this chapter within
the time limitations specified by the USEPA, State, or Village, whichever is
more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level
acceptable to the Village shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the Village for review and shall be
acceptable to the Village before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the Village under the provisions of this chapter.
Other users may be required to provide wastewater treatment as necessary and at
the discretion of the public works coordinator. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-3-2: ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES:
   A.   Whenever deemed necessary, the public works coordinator may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW
and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Each user discharging into the Village sewer system more than twenty
five thousand (25,000) gallons per day or more than five percent (5%) of the
average daily flow into the POTW, whichever is less, shall install and
maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow-
control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty four (24) hour
period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least fifty percent (50%) of
the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of
discharge controller, and shall be regulated as directed by the Village. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
   C.   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Village, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that
such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Village and shall be
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at their expense.
   D.   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
(Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-3-3: SLUG DISCHARGES:
   A.   Slug Control Plans: All users shall provide protection from accidental
or intentional discharges of materials that may cause interference or pass
through at the POTW. Facilities necessary to prevent accidental discharge or
slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's
cost and expense. The Village may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and then implement a slug control plan or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges. Significant industrial users are
required to submit a slug control plan. Any required slug control plan
submitted to the Village shall show facilities and operating procedures. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Village shall not
relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this chapter. The slug control plan shall be posted
and available for inspection at the facility during normal business hours.
   Any user required to develop and implement a slug control plan shall submit
a plan that, at a minimum, addresses the following:
      1.   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      2.   Description of stored chemicals;
      3.   Procedures for immediately notifying the public works coordinator of
any accidental or slug discharge; and
      4.   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   B.   Immediate Notification: In the case of an accidental or intentional
discharge of materials which may cause Interference or pass through at the POTW
or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall be the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the Village wastewater treatment plant
of the incident. The notification shall include name of caller, location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective action taken.
   C.   Written Report: Within fifteen (15) days of an accidental or
intentional discharge, the user shall submit to the Village a detailed written
report on forms to be provided by the Village, describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Follow up reports may be required by the Village. Such a report,
or reports, shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills,
or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such report relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by
this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or intentional
discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to the Village,
result in the revocation of the user's individual wastewater discharge permit.
   D.   Notice To Employees: Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous
places on the User's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a
slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may
cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification
procedures.
   E.   Additional Remedies: In addition to the remedies set forth elsewhere,
if the Village is fined by the IEPA or USEPA for violation of the NPDES permit
or violation of water quality standards as a result of the user's discharge of
an incompatible pollutant, then the fine, including all Village legal,
sampling, analytical testing costs and any other related costs shall be charged
to the responsible user. Such charge, shall be in addition to, not in lieu of,
any other charges.
   F.   The user shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies to the situation, where among other things, the primary source of power
is reduced, lost or fails. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-3-4: HAULED WASTEWATER:
   A.   If permitted by the public works coordinator, septic tank waste may
only be introduced into the POTW at a designated receiving structure within the
Village wastewater treatment plant area, and at such times as are established
by the public works coordinator. Such waste shall not violate section
8-13-2 of this chapter or any other requirements established by the Village.
   B.   Septic tank waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the public works coordinator. No load may be discharged without
prior consent of the public works coordinator. The public works coordinator may
collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards. The public works coordinator may require the industrial
waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   C.   Septic tank waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste
hauler, permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste.
   D.   The public works coordinator may require haulers of industrial waste to
obtain individual wastewater discharge permits. The public works coordinator
may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain individual
wastewater discharge permits. The public works coordinator also may prohibit
the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial
waste is subject to all other requirements of this chapter.
   E.   Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the public works coordinator. No load may be discharged without
prior consent of the public works coordinator. The public works coordinator may
collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards. The public works coordinator may require the industrial
waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   F.   Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste tracking form for every
load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the
industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and
addresses of sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. The
form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected waste
constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes. (Ord. 701, 12-
8-2020)

      1.   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261;
      2.   The USEPA hazardous waste number; and
      3.   The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).
   B.   If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user:
      1.   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      2.   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the wastestreams discharged during that calendar month; and
      3.   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestreams
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
   C.   All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this section
needs to be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section
8-13-6-5 of this chapter.

certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of
hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically
practical.
   H.   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-6-10: DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS:

8-13-7: SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
8-13-7-1: SAMPLING COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and
grease, sulfides, temperature, and volatile organic compounds. For all other
pollutants, twenty four (24) hour flow-proportional composite samples must be
obtained, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Village. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Village, the samples must be representative of
the discharge. The decision to allow alternative sampling must be documented in
the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136, the most
recent edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,
and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during the twenty
four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Village, as appropriate.
   B.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, the Village may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required
by this chapter and 40 CFR 403.12 (e) and (h), the industrial user is required
to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   C.   Samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist, immediately downstream from the regulated process if
no pretreatment exists, or at a location determined by the Village and
specified in the user's individual wastewater discharge permit. For categorical
users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to
pretreatment, the user shall measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to
evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards.
Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data
shall be submitted to the Village;
   D.   All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling,
and methods of analysis and shall certify that the wastestream sampled is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the
user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently that what was required in
its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136 and the
most recent edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and
Wastewater, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-7-2: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS:
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
If 40 CFR Part 136 and the most recent edition of Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater do not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant, or where the USEPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with
procedures approved by the USEPA. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-7-3: VILLAGE MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER:
The Village will follow the procedures outlined in section
8-13-7 when sampling to monitor compliance. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)

flow monitoring equipment and may perform any inspections deemed necessary or
desirable.
   G.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Village and shall not be replaced. The
user is responsible for the cost of clearing obstructions.
   H.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to the user's
premises shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-8-2: MONITORING FACILITIES:
Significant industrial users, unless deemed unnecessary by the public works
coordinator, shall provide at its own expense a monitoring facility (including
installation of a wastewater sample port), to allow inspection, sampling,
continuous monitoring and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the
Village. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises,
except, where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, the Village may concur with the facility being constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that
it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The Village,
whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling
facilities at other locations (for example, at the end of a manufacturing line
or a wastewater treatment system).
The Village may require other users to provide at its own expense a monitoring
facility (including installation of a wastewater sample port), to allow
inspection, sampling, continuous monitoring and flow measurements of each sewer
discharge to the Village.

pickup location and access for pickup, ice for samples and other items needed
and/or requested by the Village to facilitate the storage and shipping of
samples associated with the user’s monitoring requirements. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020; amd. Ord. 781, 12-10-2024)
8-13-8-3: MONITORING FACILITY OPERATION:
   A.   The operation of monitoring facility flow meters and sampling devices,
including the reading and recording of discharge volume and water quality
sampling, shall be performed by the Village unless otherwise specified in a
user's individual wastewater discharge permit.
   B.   The user may request split samples of its wastewater at any time,
provided the additional cost to the Village of splitting the sample, if any, is
paid by the user. The user shall provide the Village at least five (5) days
written notice of its request for a split sample. The user may obtain samples
with its own resources as well.
   C.   Samples required by a user's individual wastewater discharge permit
shall be collected as required and analyzed by the Village's laboratory. If the
Village's laboratory is unable to analyze samples for any reason, an
alternative analysis laboratory shall be used. The alternative laboratory shall
be chosen and agreed to by the Village and user. The costs of laboratory
analysis shall be billed to and paid by the user on a monthly basis.
   D.   All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated semiannually by a manufacturer's representative or other independent
party to ensure their accuracy. The Village or user may initiate special
procedures to verify that the wastewater sampler is collecting representative
samples. If a party does initiate verification of a sampler, the party shall
provide notice to the other party no less than two (2) days before the
verification is to be made. The user shall organize semiannual calibrations of
wastewater flow and quality devices. The user shall pay any expenses related to
the calibration or verification of monitoring facility devices, whether
initiated by the Village or user. Calibration test results shall be furnished
to both the Village and user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-8-4: MONITORING FACILITY DEVICE MALFUNCTION:
The Village and user shall attempt to resolve any disputes regarding monitoring
facility device inaccuracies in accordance with the guidelines prescribed
below:
   A.   If a monitoring device malfunctions or is demonstrated to have provided
incorrect readings, or if an identifiable consistent sampling bias or error can
be established, the volume and strength of wastewater discharged by a user
shall be based on historical data and reasonable engineering estimates of flow
and strength. This extrapolation, as determined by the Village with
consultation with the user, shall take into account all materially known
product variations.
   B.   The Village may install or require the user to install a temporary
monitoring device until a permanent monitoring device is operating properly.
The data generated by the temporary monitoring device shall be used in lieu of
historical data.
   C.   Retroactive billing adjustments made as a result of monitoring device
malfunction shall follow the terms of a user's individual wastewater discharge
permit or other agreement between the Village and said user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020)
8-13-8-5: VERIFICATION OF LABORATORY ANALYSIS:
The User may request that the Village provide a split sample to the user to
verify laboratory analysis accuracy. The user may not make this request more
than once a year. Samples shall be analyzed by the Village or their designated
analysis laboratory (the "Village Sample") and by a Village-approved state-
certified laboratory employed by the user (the "Industry Sample"). The user
shall pay for all laboratory analysis costs.
No action need be taken unless the result for a parameter of the industry
sample is different from the Village sample in an amount equal to at least
twenty five percent (25%). Where the industry sample and Village sample differ
by an amount equal to at least twenty five percent (25%), the burden is on the
user to prove that all preservation, chain-of-custody, analytical, and QA/QC
methods were followed. If the user cannot prove the proper methods were
followed, no further verifications shall be made. If it is determined the user
followed the proper methods, then the Village shall review the methods used for
the Village sample.
If it is determined both parties have followed the proper methods, the Village
may choose to accept the validity of the results provided by their designated
laboratory or agree to terms with the user for further verifications.
Alternatively, if it is determined the Village did not follow the proper
methods an additional split sample analysis shall be conducted using the
procedures described above. The Village and user shall be responsible for the
costs associated with analysis of their respective sample. If the results of
this split sample differ by an amount equal to at least twenty five percent
(25%) and it is determined the Village and user followed the proper methods, a
resolution shall be agreed upon that is acceptable to both parties. (Ord. 701,
12-8-2020)
8-13-8-6: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the Village has been refused access to a building, structure, or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that
there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect
and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the
Village designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, the Village may seek issuance of a search warrant from the
Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Jo Daviess County, Illinois.
(Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-8-7: VANDALISM:
No person shall willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface, tamper with, or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or
equipment, or other part of the POTW. Any person found in violation of this
requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in this chapter. (Ord.
701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-9: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, individual
wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge
permits, monitoring programs, and from the Village inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Village, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data", as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not
be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public
without restriction. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-10: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The Village shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW,
a list of the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all
significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
subsections C, D or H of this section) and shall mean:
   A.   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6 ) month period exceed
(by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
   B.   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH);
   C.   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by section 40 CFR 403.3(1) (Daily Maximum, long term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the Village determines has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, Interference or pass
through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public);
   D.   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Village's exercise of
its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   E.   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge
permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
   F.   Failure to provide within forty five (45) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   G.   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   H.   Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a
violation of best management practices, which the Village determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-11: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-13-11-1: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION:
When the Village finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Village may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within fifteen
(15) days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a
plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Village.
Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Village to take any
action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-11-2: CONSENT ORDERS:
The Village may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the
user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the
document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the
administrative orders issued under this chapter and shall be judicially
enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-11-3: SHOW CAUSE HEARING:
The Village may order a user which has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Village and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action,
and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the User. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020)
8-13-11-4: COMPLIANCE ORDERS:
When the Village finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Village may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time in the order. If the
user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may
be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-11-5: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS:
When the Village finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that
the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Village may issue an order
to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing
the user to:
   A.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   B.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020)
8-13-11-6: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
   A.   When the Village finds that a user has violated (or continues to
violate) any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Village may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) a day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   B.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent (10%)
per month. A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
   C.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Village to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Village may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's
appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the user. The Village may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   D.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020)
8-13-11-7: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS:
The Village may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice
to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Village
may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity
to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   A.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Village may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Village shall allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
of this chapter are initiated against the user.
   B.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Village prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-11-8: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE:
In addition to the provisions in section
8-13-5-6 of this chapter, any user who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
   A.   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
   B.   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   C.   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
   D.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   E.   Violation of the pretreatment standards in section
8-13-2 of this chapter.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under section
8-13-11-3 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the Village shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-12: JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
8-13-12-1: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:
When the Village finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Village may petition the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Jo
Daviess County, Illinois through the Village Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, order,
or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The
Village may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or
equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-12-2: CIVIL PENALTIES:
   A.   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the
Village for a minimum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.
   B.   The Village may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the
Village.
   C.   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent
of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation,
any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by
the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice
requires.
   D.   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-12-3: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
   A.   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this

imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-12-4: REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE:
The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Village may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the
Village's enforcement response plan. However, the Village may take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Village is
empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant
user. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-13: SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION:
8-13-13-1: LIABILITY INSURANCE:
The Village may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter, a
previous individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-13-2: PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES:
The Village may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or
penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this chapter, a previous
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. (Ord. 701,
12-8-2020)
8-13-13-3: WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE:
Whenever a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user
may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the
user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 701, 12-8-
2020)
8-13-13-4: PUBLIC NUISANCES:
A violation of any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard

noncompliance with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at
the discretion of the Village. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-14: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
8-13-14-1: UPSET:
   A.   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   B.   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of subsection C, below, are met.
   C.   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      1.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      2.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman
like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      3.   The user has submitted the following information to the Village
within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within
five (5) days.
         a.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         b.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         c.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   D.   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   E.   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   F.   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-14-2: PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS:
   A.   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
subsection
8-13-2-1A of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in subsections
8-13-2-1B3 through B7 of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know, or
have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
      1.   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      2.   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the Village was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements. (Ord. 701, 12-8-2020)
8-13-14-3: BYPASS:
   A.   For the purposes of this section:
      1.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      2.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   B.   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of subsections C and D of this section.
   C.   Bypass Notifications:
      1.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the Village, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      2.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Village of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall
also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and
its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The Village may waive the written report on a case
by case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty four (24)
hours.
   D.   Bypass Conditions:
      1.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Village may take an enforcement action
against a user for a bypass, unless:
         a.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         b.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         c.   The user submitted notices as required under subsection C of this
section.
      2.   The Village may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the Village determines that it will meet the three (3)

welfare of the village.
The purpose of this chapter is to maintain streets, parks and other public and
private areas within the village in a clean, sanitary and accessible condition
and to adequately protect the health, safety and public welfare of the
community, while recognizing that, subject to reasonable conditions, camping
and camp facilities associated with special events can be beneficial to the
cultural and educational climate in the village. (Ord. 775, 11-12-2024)

the same zoning lot as the campsite, and to that purpose, has an active water
and sewer account with the village;
   D.   Camping or maintenance of a campsite on any zoning lot is limited to
not more than three (3) consecutive nights and to not more than three (3)
nights in any calendar week; and
   E.   No consideration, whether in money, goods, services, or otherwise, is
given to the owner of the residential lot in exchange for the privilege of

Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of appeals
for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall review the applicant's
request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the village of
Stockton board of trustees. The village of Stockton board of trustees may
attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to
further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that all
of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   The zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of the building protections standards that would
lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability. (Ord. 541, 1-11-2011)
9-7-12: PENALTY:

9-7-13: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village of
Stockton board of trustees to fulfill the requirements of the national flood
insurance program. This chapter does not repeal, abrogate, or impair any
existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance, easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 541, 1-
11-2011)
9-7-14: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village of Stockton or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 541, 1-11-2011)

For the purpose of this chapter, certain terms and words are herewith defined
as follows:
BUILDING LINE: A line on a plat between which line and a street, alley, or
private place, no building or structures may be erected.
METES AND BOUNDS: The method used to describe a tract of urban land intended to
be used for dwelling or other purposes, so that it can be recorded in the
county recorder's office, as contrasted with a description of a part of a
property approved and recorded as a subdivision plat by the lot and block
number.
PLAT: A map, drawing, or chart prepared by an Illinois licensed land surveyor
on which the subdivider's plan of the subdivision is presented and which he
submits for approval and intends in final form to record.
SUBDIVISION: For the purpose of this chapter, a subdivision of land is either:
   A.   The division of land into three (3) or more lots, sites or parcels;
   B.   Establishment or dedication of a road, highway, street or alley through
a tract of land regardless of division or area; or
   C.   Resubdivisions of land heretofore divided or platted into lots, sites
or parcels; provided, however, that the sale or exchange of small parcels of
land to or between adjoining property owners, where such sale or exchange does
not create additional lots, shall not be considered as a subdivision of land.
Any resubdivision of recorded lots or tracts, which now front and are proposed
to front upon an existing street and where a total of not more than four (4)
new lots or sites are proposed to be created, shall be submitted to the village
board for checking the proposed resubdivision with the design standards of this
chapter and with the requirements of other village regulations, and if the
proposed resubdivision conforms to such regulations and requirements, the
village board may waive the other requirements of this chapter and the lots may
be transferred by metes and bounds or by other legal descriptions.
SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE: This chapter may be referred to and be known as "The
Subdivision Ordinance" or "This Ordinance".

requirements as outlined by this chapter, and shall approve or reject such plat
within forty five (45) days after the date of submission thereof. If the
village board does not act upon the same within forty five (45) days, the
preliminary plat shall be deemed to be approved; however, the subdivider may
agree to an extension of time for an additional time not to exceed sixty (60)
days. The approval of the preliminary plat by the village board shall
constitute authorization to proceed with the preparation of the final plat and
with the installation of the necessary improvements therein as set forth in
section
10-1-4 of this chapter.
   C.   Proposed Plat: Where a tract of land is proposed for subdivision and
the village board finds that the same would constitute a part of a larger

($150.00) for each application for a subdivision. At the time of application
for approval of the final plat or the last portion thereof, the required fee
will be recalculated on the basis of the actual number of lots created and all
adjustment of the fee will be made, the subdivider to pay an additional amount
or to receive a refund. There shall be no refund of any portion of the fee if
the subdivider fails to apply for final approval of the subdivision or if the
preliminary plat expires. In addition, the subdivider shall be responsible for
the fees incurred by the village for the services of the village engineer in
connection with the plats prepared by the subdivider and for the village
engineer's document review of the subdivider documents.

permit it to be shown on the plat. Plats shall contain proper acknowledgment of
the owners thereof and shall bear the consent of any mortgagee to said plat and
restrictions.
      13.   In addition to the foregoing, all requirements for platting as set
forth in the municipal code of Illinois and acts amendatory thereto, shall be
complied with before said plat is recorded in the office of the county
recorder. (Ord. 407, 2-13-2001)
10-1-4: MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT:
No subdivision plat shall be approved by the village board unless it conforms
to the following minimum standards:
   A.   Acre Subdivision: Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one
to three (3) acres, inclusive, and there are indications that such lots will
eventually be resubdivided into smaller building lots, consideration shall be
given to the street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision so that
additional minor streets can be opened which will permit of a logical
arrangement of smaller lots.
   B.   Relation To Adjoining Street System: The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where
adjoining property is not subdivided), insofar as they may be necessary for
public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall not be
less than the minimum street widths established herein. The street and alley
arrangements also be such as to cause no hardship to owners of adjacent
property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for convenient
access to it.
Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to
the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be
platted.
   C.   Street And Alley Width:
      1.   The minimum width for streets shall be sixty feet (60'), except that
the village board may, in certain cases, to conform with already existing
streets in the village, or because of topography or special conditions, require
a greater or lesser width.
      2.   Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) shall be avoided when possible, but
if deemed necessary in the opinion of the village board, they shall terminate
in a circular right of way with a minimum roadway diameter of ninety feet (90')
and a total diameter of one hundred twenty feet (120'), which will provide safe
and convenient space therefor.
      3.   The minimum width of all alleys shall be twenty feet (20').
      4.   Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than ten feet
(10') in width shall be provided on all rear lot lines and side lot lines where
deemed necessary for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas and
water mains. Easements of greater width may be required along lines or across
lots when deemed necessary by the village board for the extension of main
sewers or other utilities.
   D.   Blocks: The length and width of blocks shall conform as nearly as
practicable to those in the existing development of the village. However, the
village board may permit a deviation therefrom when such deviation, in their
opinion, is necessary because of the size, location, or topography of said
tract, and the proposed deviation conforms to and is in harmony with a possible
larger subdivision unit of which said proposed subdivision is a part.
   E.   Lots:
      1.   All side lot lines of lots shall be as nearly as possible at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, unless a
variation to this rule will give a better street and lot plan.
      2.   The minimum dimensions for lots located within the future urban
area, except in areas for commercial and industrial uses, shall be eighty feet
(80') in width and one hundred feet (100') in depth, but in no case shall a
rectangular or irregular shaped lot that is to be used for residential
purposes, contain less area than is required by the lot area regulation of the
district in which the property is located.
      3.   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the
maintenance of building lines on both front and side streets.
      4.   Lots at street intersections which are likely to be dangerous shall
have a radius of not less than fifteen feet (15') at the street corner.
   F.   Building Setback Lines: Building setback lines shall be shown on all
lots whenever the depth of such building lines are greater than those required
by other village regulations. When the subdivided area is not under zoning
control, the village board may require building setback lines in accordance
with the needs of each subdivision. Provision shall be made by deed requiring
all enclosed parts of buildings to be set back to such building setback lines.
   G.   Character Of Development: The village board shall have the right to
agree with the subdivider regarding the type and character of development that
will be permitted in the subdivision, and may require that certain minimum
regulations regarding this matter be incorporated in the deed restrictions.
Such regulations shall be intended to protect the character and value of the
surrounding development and shall also tend to secure the most appropriate
character of development in the property that is subdivided.
   H.   Easements Along Streams: Whenever any stream or important surface
watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider
shall at his own expense make adequate provision for straightening or widening
the channel so that it will properly carry the surface water and shall also
provide and dedicate to the village an easement along each side of the stream,
which easement shall be for the purpose of widening, improving or protecting
the stream and for recreational use. The width of such easement shall not be
less than twenty feet (20') and the total width of the easement shall be
adequate to provide for any necessary channel relocations and straightening.
   I.   Improvements: Before the final plat of any subdivided area shall be
approved and recorded, the subdivider shall retain the services of a licensed
engineer in order to develop and design improvements described in this
subsection. In lieu of final completion of the minimum improvements, before the
plat is finally approved the subdivider may follow the following method:
      1.   Post a surety bond with the village ensuring the village that the
improvements shall be completed by the subdivider within two (2) years after
final approval of the plat. The form and type of bond shall be approved by the
village attorney, and the amount of the bond shall be not less than the
estimated cost of the improvements and the amount of the estimate must be
approved by the engineer for the village. If the improvements are not completed
within the specified time, the village board may use the bond or any necessary
portion thereof to complete same.
The minimum improvements installed in a subdivision before the plat can be
finally approved shall be in accordance with the following subsections:
         a.   Street Improvements: All streets shall be filled or excavated to
the grade approved by the village board, and the roadway improved by surfacing.
The minimum standards for surfacing shall be not less than the following
requirements:
            (1)   Whenever the subdivision is located within that portion of
the village that lies within the areas described in other village regulations
as urban areas, or may lie within the probable future residential areas, the
minimum width of surfacing shall be thirty feet (30'). Commercial/industrial
width shall not be less than thirty six feet (36') minimum. Such surfacing
shall be of a type conforming to the traffic requirements of each street, but
in no event shall it be less than an all-weather road capable of bearing
vehicles at all seasons, and shall consist of not less than eight inches (8")
of compacted crushed stone or gravel, of approved specifications. Curbs will be
required along each side of the surfacing. The subdivider shall be required to
install only one-half (1/2) the width of surfacing herein required when a
street along the outer edge of his subdivision borders adjacent property that
cannot bear its share of the cost of surfacing. All surfacing shall conform to
the appropriate specifications of, and the construction shall be supervised by,
the village board.
            (2)   Whenever the subdivision is located beyond the probable
future residential areas as described in other village regulations, the minimum
width of surfacing shall be thirty feet (30'), but on each side of this
surfacing there shall be an earth shoulder having a minimum width of ten feet
(10'). The surfacing shall be an all-weather surfacing capable of bearing
vehicles at all seasons and shall consist of at least twelve inches (12") of
compacted crushed stone or gravel, of approved specifications. The surfacing
shall be in accordance with appropriate specifications of, and the construction
shall be supervised by, the village board.
         b.   Sidewalks: Sidewalks are to be four feet (4') wide and four inch
(4") thick concrete. Sidewalks are to be installed on the street side of the
property line.
         c.   Water Lines: The cost of all procedural and physical improvement
requirements incurred under the auspices of this chapter are to be borne solely
by the applicant and/or the owner of the property with the exception of a
public water supply system. In those locations where water supply is reasonably
accessible the village will contribute the installation of a public water
supply system to the boundary of each lot.
         d.   Sewers:
            (1)   Where a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, the
subdividers shall connect or provide for the connection with such sanitary
sewer, but in any event shall make provision in such subdivision for the
establishment of a sanitary sewer system accessible to each lot in the
subdivision, and such sewer system shall be approved by the village board.
            (2)   Adequate provisions shall be made for the disposal of storm
water, subject to the approval of the village board.
         e.   Public Facilities: Where public facilities ar not available,
sanitary sewers, water mains and all appurtenances necessary to extend and
provide effective, efficient, safe and potable public water and sewer service
to the development as determined by the village engineer shall be installed at
the cost of the subdivider.
         f.   Streetlights: The subdivider or land developer shall install
streetlights along all streets proposed to be dedicated of a design compatible
with the neighborhood and type of development proposed. Such lights shall be
placed at each street intersection and at such interior block spacing as may be
required by the village board. Plans and specifications shall be approved by
the village board.
         g.   Other Utilities: Whenever it is deemed necessary by the village
board, they may require the installations of electric lines, streetlights, gas
mains, street trees, and other similar facilities before said plat is approved.
(Ord. 407, 2-13-2001)
10-1-5: VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   General Requirements: Where the board finds that extraordinary
hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with
these regulations, it may recommend variations or exceptions to the
regulations, provided that such variations or exceptions to the regulations
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter,
and further provided that the board shall not recommend variations or
exceptions to the regulations of this chapter unless it shall make findings
based upon evidence that:
      1.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in
the neighborhood in which the property is located.
      2.   The conditions upon which the request for the variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variation is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property.
      3.   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulations was carried out.
      4.   Cost to the subdivider of strict or literal compliance with the
regulations shall not be the sole reason for granting a variation or exception.
      5.   The granting of a variance shall not set a precedent which may be
utilized by others or subdividers to seek variances from the provisions of this
chapter.
   B.   Conditions: In recommending variations and exceptions, the board may
require such conditions as will, in their judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the standards or requirements of this chapter.
   C.   Procedure For A Variation: A petition for any such variation shall be
submitted in writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is
filed for the consideration of the board. The petition shall fully detail the
grounds for the application and all of the facts taken into consideration by
the petitioner.
   D.   Recommendation And Approval: Such variations and exceptions shall be
forwarded to the village board of trustees in writing, substantiating the
variations and/or exceptions. The board of trustees may approve such variations
or exceptions from the requirements of this chapter in specific cases as listed
on the final plat, which in its opinion do not adversely affect the intent and
purpose of this chapter. (Ord. 407, 2-13-2001)
10-1-6: ENFORCEMENT:

recorder's office or have any validity until it shall have been approved in the
manner prescribed herein.
   B.   No building or repair permit shall issue for any structure located on a
lot in any subdivision within the village limits, the plat of which has been
filed after the effective date hereof but which has not been approved in
accordance with the provisions herein contained, or the plat of which was filed
before the effective date hereof, but did not conform to the requirements set
forth in the municipal code of Illinois, and acts amendatory thereto.
   C.   The village board shall not permit any public improvement over which it
has any control to be made or any money expended for improvements in any area
that had been subdivided or upon any street that has been plotted after the
date of the adoption of this chapter unless such subdivision or street has been
approved in accordance with the provisions contained herein. (Ord. 407, 2-13-
2001)
10-1-7: CHANGES AND AMENDMENTS:
Any regulation or provision of this chapter may be changed and amended from
time to time by the village board; provided, however, that such changes or
amendments shall not become effective until after a public hearing has been
held, public notice of which shall have been given in a newspaper of general
circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to such hearing, or as otherwise
required by law. (Ord. 407, 2-13-2001)

held to be unconstitutional or void, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 407, 2-13-2001)

11-12-1: PURPOSE:
The planned unit development district is established to provide a regulatory
framework designed to promote improved environmental design in the village of
Stockton by allowing for greater freedom, imagination and flexibility in the
development of land, while ensuring substantial compliance to the basic intent
of the zoning ordinance and the general plan for community development. It
allows diversification and variation in the relationship of uses, structures,
and open spaces in developments conceived and implemented as comprehensive and
cohesive unified projects. (Ord., 10-14-2008)
11-12-2: USES:
Any use permitted by right or as a conditional grant in any of the other

with a specific and precise development plan pursuant to the procedural and
regulatory provisions established by this title. (Ord., 10-14-2008)
11-12-3: LOT SIZE, YARD, AND BULK REGULATIONS:
In the planned unit development district, there shall be no predetermined
specific lot area, lot width, height, yard and usable open space requirements,
but such requirements as are made a part of an approved recorded precise
development plan shall be, along with the recorded plan itself, construed to be
and enforced as a part of this title. (Ord., 10-14-2008)
11-12-4: SIGNS:

district application, the following criteria shall be applied to the precise
development plan for such district with specific consideration as to whether or
not it is consistent with the spirit and intent of this title, has been
prepared with competent professional advice and guidance, and produces
significant benefits in terms of environmental design:
   A.   Character And Intensity Of Land Use: In a planned unit development
district, the uses proposed and their intensity and arrangement on the site
shall be a visual and operational character which:
      1.   Are compatible to the physical nature of the site.
      2.   Would produce an attractive environment of sustained aesthetic and
ecological desirability, economic stability and functional practicality.
      3.   Would not adversely affect the anticipated provision for school or
other municipal services.
      4.   Would not create a traffic or parking demand incompatible with the
existing or proposed facilities to serve it.
   B.   Economic Feasibility And Impact: The proponents of a planned unit
development district application shall provide evidence satisfactory to the
village board of its economic feasibility, of available adequate financing, and
that it would not adversely affect the economic prosperity of the village or
the values of surrounding properties.
   C.   Engineering Design Standards: The width of street right of way, width
and location of street or other paving, outdoor lighting, location of sewer and
water lines, provision for stormwater drainage or other similar environmental
engineering consideration shall be based upon determination as to the
appropriate standards necessary to implement the specific function in the
specific situation, provided, however, that in no case shall standards be less
than those necessary to ensure the public safety and welfare as determined by
the village.
   D.   Preservation And Maintenance Of Open Space: In a planned unit
development district, adequate provision shall be made for the permanent
preservation and maintenance of common open space either by private reservation
or dedication to the public.
      1.   In the case of private reservation, the open area to be reserved
shall be protected against building development by conveying to the village, as
part of the conditions for project approval, an open space easement over such
open areas.
      2.   The care and maintenance of such open space reservation shall be
assured by establishment of appropriate management organization for the
project. The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such cost to
individual properties shall be included in any contractual agreement with the
village and shall be included in the title to each property.
      3.   Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservation shall
be established in a manner acceptable to the village and made a part of the
conditions of plan approval.
   E.   Implementation Schedule: The proponents of a planned unit development
district shall submit a reasonable schedule for the implementation of the
development to the satisfaction of the village board, including suitable
provisions for assurance that each phase could be brought to completion in a
manner which would not result in adverse effect upon the community as a result
of termination at that point. (Ord., 10-14-2008)

property is located.

light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of

land and buildings, and bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land, are mutually compatible and substantially uniform.
However, there are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics,
cannot be properly classified as unrestricted permitted uses in any particular
district or districts, without consideration, in each case, of the impact of
those uses upon neighboring land or public facilities, and of the public need
for the particular use at a particular location. Such uses, nevertheless, may
be necessary or desirable to be allowed in a particular district provided that
due consideration is given to location, development and operation of such uses.
Such uses are classified as special uses.
   B.   Authority Of The Board Of Appeals And Village Board; Requirements:

applications as necessary to make recommendations to the village board. Special
use permits may be granted, modified or revoked only by the village board.

reasonable time, make a recommendation to the village board regarding the
application for a special use. Prior to making a recommendation, the board of
appeals shall make findings based upon the evidence presented that the
standards herein prescribed are being complied with.
      3.   Any development within five hundred feet (500') of the existing or
proposed rights of way of freeways, expressways, interstate and controlled
access trafficways, and within one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') of their
existing or proposed interchange or turning lane rights of way shall be
specifically reviewed by the highway agency that has jurisdiction over the
trafficway. The board of appeals shall request such review and await the
