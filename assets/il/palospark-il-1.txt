in which the Councilmember is finally adjudged to be guilty of a criminal act;

indemnification or any criminal proceeding shall thereafter be instituted, any
indemnification paid or promised shall be conditioned upon the termination of
the criminal proceeding without a finding of guilt;

to the Village itself or where the Village was injured and the Village
Councilmember either obtained personal benefit or financial gain as a result of

Village-initiated or approved investigation into the misconduct of the

pending compliance by the employee and a favorable report by the doctor. In the
event the employee is determined to be fit to work by a physician's
examination, he or she shall not be entitled to any sick time benefit payments.

who elects to call in sick and utilize sick time credit for the named normal
holiday shall not be entitled to a paid day to compensate for that named
holiday, unless he or she provides a doctor's verification of illness.

of the Commissioner of Public Health and Safety and the Mayor, to amend or
revoke any of the rules and regulations and to make additional rules and
regulations from time to time as the circumstances for the good of the service
may require. If any provision, clause or phrase of these rules and regulations
or the application of the same to any person or circumstance is held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the
remaining rules and regulations which can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application, and to this end the provisions of these rules and
regulations are declared to be separable.

compilation of rules and regulations can be established which will embrace all
cases arising in the discharge of their duties. Necessarily some matters must
be left to the intelligence and discretion of the individuals. However, all
employees and members of the Department must understand that if discretion is
used by a member of the Department in a wanton or unreasonable manner which is
determined to be detrimental to the discipline and efficiency of the Department
and the image of the Village, and which law and sound public opinion recognize
as injurious to the ability of the Department and the Village to protect and
serve the community, such member of the Department who violates or attempts to
violate these rules and regulations will be subject to disciplinary action.
   Disciplinary action for violations of these rules and regulations, either
attempted or actual, or an improper utilization of discretion of the
aforementioned type, shall be exclusively limited to reprimand, suspension,
reduction in rank or dismissal.
   Existence of facts establishing a violation of law, rules or regulations,
general or special orders, policies or procedures or written or verbal orders,
is all that is necessary as a basis for Departmental discipline. All previous

exceeds the level of the presumption of being under the influence as found in
the Illinois Vehicle Code.
       (4)   Possession or Use of Controlled Substances. Possession and/or use
of controlled substances, except with the approval and guidance of a licensed

integrity of the Department or the Village.

loan for a Village official or other member or employee of the Department.
      (6)   Information on Criminal Activity. Withholding of information on
criminal activity;
       (7)   Self-Assigned Police Action. For the purpose of this section,

undertaking of self-assigned police action while off duty and outside the
corporate limits of the Village, except when necessary because of imminent
danger to life, is prohibited. All such action shall be reported to the Chief
of Police within twenty-four hours in writing.

five years, who are under criminal investigation or indictment, or who have an
open and notorious reputation in the community for felonious activity, is
prohibited.

   (b)   The standard for participation in the Fund shall be an employment
position normally requiring performance of duty of 1,000 or more hours per year
as defined by the Village in the official job description. With respect to
part-time employees with the Village, there shall be two categories of part-
time employment positions: Class A (IMRF Participating) and Class B (IMRF Non-
Participating), as follows:
      (1)   Class A part-time employment positions shall consist of those part-
time positions defined by the Village in the official job description as
normally requiring at least 1,000, but not more than 1,560 calendar hours, per
year and thus shall involve participation in the Fund.
      (2)   Class B part-time employment positions shall consist of those part-
time positions defined by the Village in the official job description as
normally requiring fewer than 1,000 calendar hours per year and thus shall not
involve participation in the Fund.
   The designation of any part-time classification as Class A or Class B shall
be determined solely by the official job description as determined by the
Village in its discretion. The actual number of hours worked by an individual
part-time employee in any given calendar year shall have no effect on that
employee's part-time classification, or the employee's IMRF participation
status.
(Ord. 1999-37. Passed 9-13-99; Ord. 2018-06. Passed 2-26-18.)
   (c)   The Village Clerk shall file a certified copy of this section with the

(Ord. 1988-56. Passed 8-22-88.)
256.11 PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   All employees of the Village, except employees of the Police Department,
which has its own standards, shall be required to successfully complete a six-
month probationary period of employment. The six-month period shall be
continuous and uninterrupted by a leave of absence from the Village, either
approved or unapproved. In the event of such an absence from the Village, the
probationary period will begin anew upon the employee's return to employment.
Any probationary employee shall remain a terminable "at will" employee of the
Village until the successful completion of the prescribed period of probation.
(Ord. 1992-13. Passed 4-27-92.)
256.12 HOURS.
   All employees of the Village (except Police Department personnel) shall be
required to work hours in accordance with the standards established in this
section and shall conform to all applicable State and Federal standards and
laws.
   The work standards applicable to all civilian employees shall be based on a
seven-day period, beginning on Saturday and ending on the following Friday of
each week. Within this seven-day period, all full-time civilian employees shall
be required to work thirty-five hours. Any hour worked in excess of the thirty-
fifth hour through the fortieth hour in any seven-day period shall be
compensated at the employee's regular hourly rate. Any hour worked in excess of
the fortieth hour in any seven-day period shall be compensated in accordance
with the overtime rate provided in Section
256.13.
(Ord. 1992-13. Passed 4-27-92.)
256.13 OVERTIME; COMPENSATORY TIME OFF.
   All Village employees who work in excess of the standard hours established
in Section
256.12 shall be compensated as follows:
   (a)   The Village Manager , the Village Clerk and department heads shall not
be paid overtime. The Village Manager, the Village Clerk and department heads
of the Village are salaried and do not receive overtime, but may claim
compensatory time off when the demand of their work requires them to work
beyond thirty-five hours per week. Requests for compensatory time must be
approved by the commissioner in charge of the department or the Mayor prior to
the taking of any compensatory time. When additional work hours can be
reasonably anticipated, prior approval of the commissioner in charge of the
department or the Mayor shall be obtained.
   Compensatory time may be used only after it is earned, and it shall be used
during the pay period in which it was earned or the pay period immediately
following the pay period in which it was earned.
   (b)   For Village employees other than those specified in subsection (a)
hereof, any hour worked in excess of forty hours in a seven-day period shall be
compensated at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular hourly
rate.
(Ord. 1994-24. Passed 7-11-94.)
256.14 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   All Village employees shall be credited with thirty-five hours of sick
leave (i.e. five seven-hour work days) on January 1 and July 1 of each year.
Such sick leave shall be taken in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Any employee on sick leave shall take whatever steps are medically
necessary to remedy his or her condition and shall not engage in social or
commercial pursuits unless specifically authorized by his or her physician. Any
employee who engages in commercial or social pursuits on a sick day shall
provide, upon request, proof of compliance with this provision. In the event an
employee fails to provide such proof of compliance with the foregoing
provision, he or she shall not be entitled to any sick-leave benefit payments.
Failure to provide proof of compliance shall be prima-facie evidence of a
willful intent on behalf of the employee to violate departmental rules. Such
willful violation shall subject such employee to disciplinary action.
      (2)   Any time an employee is absent from work for three or more paid
consecutive days with a reported illness, such employee shall be required to
submit a letter or report from a medical physician providing a written release
to return to work.
   (b)   A physical examination by a medical physician may be ordered at any
time by the Village for any employee who reports illness and uses the sick-time
benefit when there is, as hereinafter defined, reasonable cause to believe that
such person is abusing this benefit. The Village reserves the right to select
the doctor. This examination will determine the eligibility of the person for
sick leave. Any and all sick leave benefits shall be withheld pending the
compliance by the employee and favorable report by the doctor. In the event the
employee is determined fit to work by a physician's examination, he or she
shall not be entitled to any sick-leave benefit payments, and such
determination by such physician shall be prima-facie evidence of a willful
intent on behalf of such employee to violate Village rules. Such willful
violation shall subject the employee to disciplinary action.
   "Reasonable cause," as used herein, shall be defined as follows:
      (1)   The employee is observed in a social, commercial or recreational
pursuit when on sick leave and fails to provide any evidence, by way of medical
certificate or otherwise, that his or her condition makes him or her unable to
perform his or her duties for the Village.
      (2)   The employee, upon appropriate inquiry, fails to give any
indication or explanation of the nature or extent of his or her illness or
injury.
   (c)   Any sick leave used shall not be credited toward any overtime
standards as established in this chapter.
   (d)   All earned unused sick leave accrued during the course of an
employee's active employment with the Village shall be applicable toward
retirement credit in accordance with all IMRF requirements.
(Ord. 1992-13. Passed 4-27-92.)
256.15 HOLIDAYS.
   All full-time Village employees shall be entitled to a maximum of ten paid
days for holidays and shall be compensated in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter. For purposes of compensation, holidays shall be credited toward
any overtime standard established in this chapter.
   All full-time, civilian employees of the Village are entitled to be off on
the following holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas
Day. In addition, all full-time employees of the Village are entitled to be off
for two "floating holidays," with the dates thereof to be determined by the
full-time employee.
(Ord. 1992-13. Passed 4-27-92; Ord. 2006-08. Passed 2-27-06.)
256.16 VACATIONS.
   (a)   All full-time employees of the Village shall be entitled to the
following periods of paid vacation leave, subject to availability as determined
by the appropriate department and in accordance with the written policy of such
department, as follows:
      (1)   Upon completion of one complete and continuous year of service:
seventy hours of paid leave (i.e. ten working days).
      (2)   Upon completion of five years of complete and continuous service:
105 hours of paid leave (i.e. fifteen working days).
      (3)   Upon completion of fifteen years of complete and continuous
service: 140 hours paid vacation (i.e. twenty working days).
   (b)   Vacation time shall be credited to each full-time employee on January
1 immediately following the completion of the required number of years of
service, and every January 1 thereafter.
   (c)   Permanent part-time administrative employees are entitled to twice
their number of regularly scheduled work days per week as paid vacation.
   (d)   Those employees not working an entire year shall be given vacation
time prorated as follows: civilian personnel shall be given seven hours (i.e.
one day) for each thirty-six calendar-day period worked during the preceding
partial year.
   (e)   Those employees submitting their vacation requests by February 15 of
the scheduled year and thirty days before the effective date requested, will,
if possible, be given approval by March 15. Where there is a conflict, approval
will be based upon seniority. Once a vacation request is submitted and
approved, it may be required to be taken as approved.
   (f)   Any vacation request submitted after February 15 must be submitted a
minimum of thirty days before the effective date requested, or such request may
not be approved. There is no requirement that such a request made after
February 15 will be approved. Such requests shall be considered on a first
received basis without consideration for seniority.
   (g)   All vacation time must be taken within one year of having been earned.
(Ord. 1992-13. Passed 4-27-92.)

(Res. 1992-R11. Passed 10-12-92.)
256.20 SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY.
   (a)   Adoption. The following substance abuse policy is hereby adopted.
   (b)   Goals.  The goal of this policy is to ensure that each Village
employee is fit for duty and is as productive as possible every day. It remains
the Village's desire and intent to encourage any employee with an alcohol or
drug dependency problem to seek professional assistance before the problem
leads to an incident requiring disciplinary action.
   (c)   Definitions.  As used in this section:
      (1)   Illegal drug means any drug which is not legally obtainable or
which is legally obtainable but has not been legally obtained. The term
includes prescribed drugs not legally obtained and prescribed drugs not being
used for prescribed purposes or used to excess. The term also includes
marijuana.
      (2)   Legal drug means prescribed drugs, alcohol and over-the-counter
drugs which have been legally obtained and are being used for the purpose for
which they were prescribed or manufactured.
      (3)   Under the influence means that an employee is affected by a drug or
alcohol or a combination of a drug and alcohol in any detectable manner.
   (d)   Alcohol. Possession, use or being under the influence of alcohol by an
employee while at work or on Village property or on Village business is
prohibited.
   (e)   Illegal Drugs.  Possession, use, sale, purchase or being under the
influence of an illegal drug by an employee while at work on Village property
or on Village business is prohibited.
   (f)   Legal Drugs.
      (1)   An employee's use of a legal drug is not prohibited unless such use
could pose a significant risk to the safety of the employee or others.
      (2)   An employee who has reason to believe that the use of a legal drug
may present a safety risk to himself, herself or others must report such drug
use to the Village to determine job-related consequences. The Village may
require the employee to take a leave of absence or comply with other
appropriate remedies established by Village authorities.
   (g)   Drug and Alcohol Testing. The Village may require a blood test,
breathalyzer test, urinalysis or other drug/alcohol test of an employee whom
the Village has reasonable cause to suspect of using or being under the
influence of a drug while at work or on Village property or on Village
business. This may include an employee who has been suspected of being under
the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
   If a drug test reveals that an employee has illegal drugs and/or alcohol in
his or her system, the test results will be considered with other evidence that
the employee was under the influence of illegal drugs and/or alcohol at the
time of the test.
   If an employee is required to leave work for a drug or alcohol test, the
Village will pay the employee for time lost from scheduled work for that day,
provided the employee's test results are negative.
   (h)   Disciplinary Action.
      (1)   A violation of any of the provisions of this substance abuse policy
may result in termination, even for a first offense.
      (2)   Under appropriate circumstances, an employee's refusal to consent
to a drug/alcohol search or test under the provisions of this policy may also
result in termination, even for a first refusal.
      (3)   An employee who is participating in a chemical dependency treatment
program may be required to undergo periodic drug/alcohol testing at any time at
the sole discretion of the Village authorities during the treatment and for up
to two years following completion of any chemical dependency treatment program.
      (4)   An employee who has successfully gone through treatment under an
assistance plan and who subsequently is found to be under the influence, or who
tests positive on a periodic test as required under this substance abuse
policy, may be terminated.
   (i)   Assistance Programs.
      (1)   The Village encourages the use of substance abuse assistance
programs (SAAP) which provide help to employees who suffer from alcohol or drug
abuse. However, it is the responsibility of the employee to seek assistance
from an assistance program before alcohol and/or drug use leads to disciplinary
action under this policy.
      (2)   The employee's decision to seek prior assistance from the SAAP will
not be used as the basis for disciplinary action. On the other hand, using the
SAAP will not be a defense to avoid disciplinary action where the facts proving
a violation of this policy are obtained outside of the SAAP.
   (j)   Condition of Employment. As a condition of employment, each employee
shall:
      (1)   Agree in writing to abide by the terms of this Village policy
respecting a drug and alcohol-free workplace; and
      (2)   Agree to notify his or her supervisor of his or her conviction of
any criminal drug statute for a violation occurring on Village premises, or
while performing work of the Village, not later than five days after such
conviction.
   (k)   Dissemination of Policy and Assistance. In order to make employees
aware of dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, the Village shall:
      (1)   Provide each employee with a copy of the Village drug and alcohol
policy;
      (2)   Post notice of the Village drug and alcohol policy in a place where
other information for employees is posted;
      (3)   Make available materials from local, State and national anti-drug
and alcohol abuse organizations as requested;
      (4)   Enlist the aid of community and State agencies with drug and
alcohol information and rehabilitation programs to provide information to
Village employees when needed; and
      (5)   Encourage employees suspected of having a drug or alcohol abuse
problem to refer themselves to their supervising administrators who would treat
all referrals confidentially, whether of oneself or another, and initiate no
disciplinary action in such instances, except that said supervisor shall be
allowed to recommend substance abuse assistance programs where appropriate.
   (l)   Notice. As provided in paragraph (k)(2) hereof, the following drug-
free workplace policy shall be posted in a place where other information for
employees is posted:
   - NOTICE -
   DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
   This statement is published pursuant to the provisions of the Drug-Free
Workplace Act (30 ILCS 580/1 et seq.) and the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988

performance of work pursuant to the provisions of a grant or contract with the
State of Illinois or the United States of America.

dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance, including cannabis, is
prohibited in the workplace. Any employee violating such prohibition will be
suspended, terminated or ordered to participate in a drug abuse assistance/
rehabilitation program.
   As a condition of employment on a grant or a contract with the State of
Illinois or the United States of America, the employee must abide by the terms
of this statement and must give notice of any criminal drug statute conviction
for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such
conviction.

(Res. 1995-R-12. Passed 10-9-95.)
256.21 EMPLOYMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Council hereby adopts the following policy:
      (1)   The Village of Palos Park is committed to prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin
or handicapped status throughout the employment process, from selection through
termination;
      (2)   The Village shall hire individuals solely on the basis of job-
related qualifications and their ability to perform a job. Unless otherwise
provided in writing, employment with the Village shall be considered to be at-
will, so that either party may terminate the relationship at any time and for
any nondiscriminatory reason;
      (3)   The Village shall assume the necessary steps to comply with
existing Federal, State and local fair employment laws and guidelines;
      (4)   All officials and personnel of the Village shall comply with the
policy and procedures set forth in this section; and
      (5)   The Village Manager is hereby authorized to oversee the

vehicle was being operated in violation of Section
424.02, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in Section
424.03 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the
recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of
violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner
provided for above. The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall retain a copy of
all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
owner of the vehicle. Each Notice of Violation shall constitute evidence of the

forth an applicable defense. The Notice of Violation shall constitute evidence
of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding

   (a)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator, by certified report, may request
that the Secretary of State suspend the driving privileges of an owner of a
registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a
result of five automated traffic violations. The report shall be certified and
contain the following:
      (1)   The name, last known address as recorded with the Secretary of
State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or
as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent
under this chapter is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of
the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of
any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;
      (2)   The name of the municipality making the report pursuant to this
section; and
      (3)   A statement that a Notice of Impending Driver's License Suspension
has been sent to the person named in the report at the address recorded with

Post Office approved database; the date on which such notice was sent; and
address to which such notice was sent.
   (b)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall notify the Secretary of
State whenever a person named in the certified report has paid the previously

original report was in error. A certified copy of such notification shall also
be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein.
   (c)   Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that his or

Compliance Administrator. The person shall, within seven days after having
received notice from the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak
with the Traffic Compliance Administrator to challenge the accuracy of the

already paid their fine for the five or more automated traffic violations, the
Traffic Compliance Administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of

428.03 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the
police officer shall cause the motor vehicle to be removed or towed to a
facility authorized by the Village. When the vehicle is towed, the Village
shall notify or make a reasonable attempt to notify the owner of record,
lessee, or person identifying himself or herself as the owner or lessee of the
vehicle, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the owner
of record's or lessee's right to request a preliminary hearing and to
participate in a plea/evidentiary hearing, as provided in this chapter. The
Village shall also provide notice that the motor vehicle shall be impounded
pending the completion of the hearings provided for in this chapter, unless the
owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle, or a lien holder of record of
the motor vehicle, posts with the Village a cash bond and pays all towing and
storage fees, as set forth in Section
428.04 below.
   (b)   A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a motor
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter shall
first ascertain whether the seizure and impoundment is necessary and reasonable
under the circumstances. If in the judgment of the police officer then present,
a person authorized by the owner of record or the operator of the motor vehicle
is present and capable to provide for the lawful immediate removal of the motor
vehicle, and said motor vehicle is not required to be held as evidence in
regard to the violation, the police officer shall allow that individual to
promptly remove the motor vehicle without it being subject to seizure and
impoundment if seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is discretionary
pursuant to Section
428.02(h) above or seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is contemplated
pursuant to Sections
428.02(a) through (g) above.
(Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-11-11; Ord. 2012-06. Passed 2-27-12.)
428.04 POSTING A BOND.
   If a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) is posted with the
Village, the impounded motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record,
upon the payment by the owner of record of the towing and storage costs to the
applicable towing company. If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to
Section
428.06(b) below, the bond shall be applied to said fee; provided, in the event
that a violation of this section is not proven, the bond shall be returned to
the person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this section
shall be held by the Village until a hearing officer issues a decision, or, if
there is judicial review pursuant to Section
428.10, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.

428.05 PRELIMINARY HEARING.
   Where the owner of record of a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of
this chapter makes a request, in writing and filed with the Chief of Police or
the Chief of Police's designee, for a preliminary hearing within twelve hours
after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the Chief of Police or the Chief of
Police's designee must conduct a preliminary hearing within twenty-four hours
after the request for a preliminary hearing is received by the Village;
provided that if the date for the preliminary hearing falls on a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next
business day following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For purposes of
this section, the following shall apply:
   (a)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the preliminary hearing.
   (b)   The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary
hearing, and hearsay testimony shall be allowed, and shall be admissible.
   (c)   If, after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Chief of
Police or the Chief of Police's designee determines that there is probable
cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as provided in Section
428.02 above, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee shall order
the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle, unless the owner of record of
the motor vehicle posts a cash bond with the Village in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00), and pays the towing and storage costs to the
applicable tow company, as set forth in Section
428.04 above.
   (d)   If the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police's designee determines
that there is not probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as
provided in Section
428.02 above, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record of the
motor vehicle without any fees or other costs, but the owner of record shall be
responsible to pay any towing or storage charges to the applicable tow company.
(Ord. 2011-31. Passed 7-11-11; Ord. 2020-21. Passed 10-12-20; Ord. 2025-07.
Passed 4-14-25.)
428.06 PLEA HEARING/EVIDENTIARY HEARING.
   (a)   Notice of Hearing. Within ten days after a motor vehicle is impounded
pursuant to this chapter, the Village shall notify the owner of record, any
lessee and any lien holder of record, of the date, time and location of a plea
hearing that shall be conducted, pursuant to this section. Such notice shall be
mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, and First Class U.S. Mail
to the owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of record, as shown on
the records of the Illinois Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail or
First Class U.S. Mail need not be given when the owner of record of the motor
vehicle, any lessee and any lien holder of record have been personally served
with notice, in written form, of the time, date and location of the plea
hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer, designated
by the Village Manager. The owner of record, any lessee and any lien holder of
record shall appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.
If a plea of guilty is entered, or if the owner of record, any lessee and lien
holder of record fail to appear, the case shall be disposed of at that time,
with an order/default order in favor of the Village, which order/default order
shall require the payment to the Village of the five hundred dollars ($500.00)
administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company,
and the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record,
any lessee or lien holder of record pays to the Village the five hundred
dollars ($500.00) administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the
applicable towing company. If the owner of record, any lessee or any lien
holder of record pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled
and held no later than forty-five days after the motor vehicle was impounded,
unless continued by the hearing officer. All interested persons shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing. At any time
prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request
of either the Village, the owner of record, any lessee or lien holder of
record, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the evidentiary
hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the evidentiary
hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible.
   (b)   If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer determines, by
a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in connection
with a violation set forth in Section 428.02 above, the hearing officer shall
enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable
to the Village for an administrative fee in the amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00), and require the motor vehicle to continue to be impounded until the
owner of record pays the administrative fee to the Village, plus applicable
towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company. The five hundred dollar
($500.00) administrative fee shall be a debt due to the Village. If a cash bond
has been posted pursuant to Section
428.04 or Section
428.05(c) above, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If the
owner of record fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer
shall enter a default order in favor of the Village, which order shall require
the payment to the Village of the five hundred dollar ($500.00) administrative
fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the
continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record pays to
the Village the five hundred dollar ($500.00) administrative fee and towing and
storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the hearing officer finds no
such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return
of the owner of record's motor vehicle without any fee or other costs, or, if a
cash bond had previously been posted, the cash bond shall be returned, but the
owner of record shall be responsible for any towing or storage charges to the
applicable tow company. All orders entered by the hearing officer under this
subsection shall be in writing.
   (c)   At the evidentiary hearing, the violation citation shall be prima
facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in the citation,
and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to prove that the
violation was not committed.
   (d)   If the hearing officer finds that the Village exceeded its authority
under this chapter in the seizure and impoundment of a motor vehicle, the
Village shall be liable to the owner of record or lessee of the motor vehicle
for the cost of storage fees and reasonable attorney's fees.

428.07 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (a)   If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid
within thirty-five days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner
of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearings provided in Section
428.06 above, or who admits guilt at the plea hearing, the motor vehicle shall
be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provides by law for
the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/1-100, et
seq., as amended. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and applicable
towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company are not paid within
thirty-five days after the expiration of time by which administrative review of
the hearing officer's determination may be sought pursuant to Section 428.10
below, or within thirty-five days after an action seeking administrative review
has been resolved in favor of the Village, whichever is applicable, the motor
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625
ILCS 5/1-100, et seq., as amended.
   (b)   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner of record,
lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a
motor vehicle impounded under this chapter until the administrative fee and
towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company imposed pursuant to this
chapter have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record
against an impounded motor vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings,
possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she
agrees in writing to refund to the Village the amount of the net proceeds of
any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of
record, not to exceed the administrative fee, plus the applicable towing and
storage costs.
   (c)   Costs for towing and storage of a motor vehicle pursuant to this
chapter shall be those approved by the Chief of Police for all tow companies
authorized to tow for the Police Department.

   This chapter is in addition to and shall not replace or otherwise abrogate
any existing State or Federal laws or any ordinance that relates to the seizure
or impoundment of motor vehicles, and any fee provided for in this chapter
shall be in addition to any and all penalties that may be assessed or imposed
by a court for any criminal charges. This section shall not apply:
   (a)   If the motor vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time of
the violation and verifiable proof of the theft is provided to the Village;

(Ord. 1970-2. Passed 6-22-70.)
470.03 NOTIFICATION TO POLICE DEPARTMENT; TOWING.
   When an abandoned, lost, stolen or unclaimed motor vehicle or other vehicle
comes into the temporary possession or custody of a person in this State, not
the owner of the vehicle, such person shall immediately notify the Police
Department when the vehicle is in the Municipality. Upon receipt of such
notification, the Chief of Police shall authorize a towing service to remove
and take possession of the abandoned, lost, stolen or unclaimed motor vehicle
or other vehicle. The towing service shall safely keep the towed vehicle and
its contents and maintain a record of the two until the vehicle is claimed by
the owner or any other person legally entitled to possession thereof or until
it is disposed of as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 1970-2. Passed 6-22-70.)
470.04 TOWING; COSTS.
   (a)   When a motor vehicle or other vehicle is abandoned on a highway in the
Municipality for ten hours or more, its removal by a towing service may be
authorized by order of the Chief of Police.
   (b)   When an abandoned, unattended, wrecked, burned or partially dismantled
motor vehicle or other vehicle is creating a traffic hazard because of its
position in relation to the highway, or when its physical appearance is causing
an impediment to traffic, its immediate removal from the highway by a towing
service may be authorized by order of the Chief of Police.
   (c)   When a vehicle is removed from either public or private property by
order of the Chief of Police, the owner of the vehicle shall be responsible for
all towing costs. Vehicles removed from public or private property and stored
by a commercial vehicle relocator or other towing service authorized by the
Chief of Police in compliance with this chapter, or at the request of the
vehicle owner or operator, shall be subject to a possessor lien for services
pursuant to the Labor and Storage Lien (Small Amount) Act (770 ILCS 50/1, et
seq.), as authorized by Section 4-203(g) of the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS
5/4-203(g)). In no event shall such lien be greater than the rate or rates
established by the Illinois Commerce Commission pursuant to Section 18a-200(6)
of the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/18a-200(6)). No lien authorized by
this section shall exceed two thousand dollars ($2,000) in its total amount,
nor shall such lien be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services
or materials rendered in addition to those authorized by this chapter and the
Illinois Vehicle Code.

   (c)   The owner, operator or other legally entitled person shall be
responsible to the towing service for payment of applicable removal, towing,
storage, and processing charges and collection costs associated with a vehicle
towed or held under order or authorization of the Chief of Police. If a vehicle
towed or held under order or authorization of the Chief of Police is seized and
sold at public auction, any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing
charges and collection costs shall be paid to the towing service from the
proceeds of the sale. Any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing
charges and collection costs shall be paid to the towing service from the
Municipal Treasury. That payment shall not, however, exceed the amount of
proceeds from the sale, with the balance to be paid by the owner, operator or
other legally entitled person.
   (d)   Upon delivery of a written release order to the towing service, a
vehicle subject to a hold order shall be released to the owner, operator or
other legally entitled person upon proof of ownership or other entitlement and

the State Police to be searched by a communication directed to the State
Police, for stolen or wanted information on the vehicle. When the State Police
files are searched with negative results, the information contained in the
National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files will be searched by the State
Police. The information determined from these record searches shall be used by
the Police Department in sending a notification by certified mail to the
registered owner, lienholder and other legally entitled persons, advising where
the vehicle is held, requesting a disposition to be made and setting forth
public sale information. Notification shall be sent no later than ten business
days after the date the Police Department impounds or authorizes the impounding
of a vehicle, provided that if the Police Department is unable to determine the
identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other person legally entitled
to ownership of the impounded vehicle within a ten business day period after

date the identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other persons legally
entitled to ownership of the impounded vehicle is determined.

provisions of this chapter, the Village shall, upon payment in full of the

certificate based on the floor area each separately uses.
804.06 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER VILLAGE REQUIREMENTS.
   No license or permit shall be issued for the conduct of any business in the
Village if the premises and buildings to be used for such purpose do not fully
comply with the requirements of the Village. Any license or permit issued

or to detect violations thereof, the licensee, or the person in charge of the
premises to be inspected, shall admit thereto, for the purpose of making such
an inspection, any officer or employee of the Village who is authorized or
directed to make such inspection, at any reasonable time that admission is
requested.
   Whenever the analysis of any commodity or material is reasonably necessary
to secure conformity with any ordinance or to detect violations thereof, any
licensee whose business is governed by such ordinance shall give to any
authorized officer or employee of the Municipality requesting the same,
sufficient samples of such material or commodity for such analysis, upon
request.
   In addition to any other penalty which may be provided, the Mayor may revoke
the license of any proprietor of any licensed business in the Village who
refuses to permit any such officer or employee who is authorized to make such
inspection or to take such sample, to make the inspection or take an adequate
sample of the desired commodity, or who interferes with such officer or
employee while in the performance of his or her duty in making such inspection.
However, no license shall be revoked for such cause unless written demand is
made upon the licensee or person in charge of the premises, in the name of the
Village, stating that such inspection or sample is desired, at the time it is
sought to make the inspection or obtain the sample.
804.09 REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATES; APPEALS.

establishment or firm is found to be in violation of any of the standards set
forth in this chapter, the inspecting officer shall so notify the owner/
operator of the establishment or firm of the violation and set a time limit for
the correction of the same commensurate with the seriousness of the violation.
If the violation is not corrected within the time specified or if the violation
is of such serious nature as to be of immediate danger to the health, safety
and welfare of the people, then the commercial establishment or firm shall be
closed by order of the Mayor until such time as the violation has been
corrected.
   If the commercial establishment or firm is in violation of the standards set
forth in this chapter three or more times within the fiscal year or fails to
procure a required certificate within three months after the required renewal
date, the Mayor may suspend or revoke the business certificate.
   If the business or firm wishes to appeal the decision of the Mayor, it shall
apply to the Mayor, in writing, for a hearing before Council. During the
appeal, the business shall remain closed.
804.10 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall engage in the business of a commercial establishment,
business and/or commercial enterprise or activity, as otherwise provided for in
this chapter, without first obtaining a license therefor or complying with the
applicable registration requirements.
(Ord. 2013-05. Passed 1-28-13.)
804.11 APPLICABILITY OF REQUIREMENT.
   Whenever in this chapter a license is required for the maintenance,
operation or conduct of any business or establishment, or for doing business or
engaging in any activity or occupation, whoever, by himself or herself or
through an agent, employee or partner, holds himself or herself forth as being
engaged in the business or occupation, or attempts to perform any part of such
business or occupation, in the Village, shall be subject to such requirement.
804.12 EXCLUDED ACTIVITIES.
   The provisions of this chapter are not applicable to any activity carried on
or operated by a governmental institution or jurisdiction or by any recognized
charitable institution or organization. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
contractors hired by a recognized charitable institution or organization must
comply with the contractor registration provisions of Section 804.17.
(Ord. 2013-05. Passed 1-28-13.)
804.13 APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATES; EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   Regulatory certificates issued for all commercial and service activities
shall be valid for one year following the date of issuance. All commercial
establishments with buildings or premises in the Village shall file with the
Village Clerk an application for the regulatory certificate to operate the
commercial establishment in the Village. Such application shall be filed not
later than April 30 of each year or at such time as the commercial
establishment desires to commence operations in the Village. Application forms
for all such documents shall be issued by the Clerk upon request.
   Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the Clerk, or such personnel as
may be designated by the Clerk, shall issue the certificate after
investigations by the Building, Fire and Police Departments, and by the Health
Officer, where applicable, to permit the operation of the commercial
establishment in the Village for a period of one year which shall begin on
January 1 of the year for which such document is issued and shall terminate on
December 31 of said year. All certificates shall be issued at the yearly rate
of fees for the full regulatory year, provided that where such document is
issued on or after July 1, the regulatory fee shall be one-half of the yearly
fee for the unexpired term of the regulatory year. Recognizing that
certificates issued for the May 1, 2003 through April 30, 2004 certificate year
will have four (4) months remaining at the start of the January 1, 2004 through
December 31, 2004 certificate year, the applicable fee for the January 1, 2004
through December 31, 2004 certificate year, as set forth in Section
804.14 below, shall be reduced by one-third (1/3) for any business holding a
valid certificate at the time of application for the January 1, 2004 through
December 31, 2004 certificate.
   The required fee for each certificate issued shall be collected upon
application. In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any regulatory
fee, or part thereof, by reason of death or by any reason of non-use of the
certificate or discontinuance of the operation of the commercial establishment
or other commercial or service activity.
   If a commercial establishment moves its place of operation from one location
in the Village to another location in the Village, the charge for a new
regulatory certificate shall be the established prevailing rate for the new
location, with due credit given for the charge for the original effective
document.
   Regulatory fees for vending machines shall be applied to the individual
machine and not to the business location. Such vending machines cannot be
relocated within the Village without the issuance of a new certificate, upon
notification of such relocation, in writing, to the Clerk.

to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a
sale for resale.
   (b)   If a person who received electricity in the Village claims to be an

898.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
   (a)   "Amusement" means and includes both participative and exhibitive

utilizing any amusement regardless of whether such fees or charges are
characterized as admission fees, membership fees, use charges, rent, rental or
service charges, exclusive of any tax imposed by the United States government,
the State of Illinois, the Village or any other governmental unit. A fee or
charge which entitles the patrons in regard to any amusement operated within
the corporate limits of the Village to bona fide services in addition to, or
unrelated to, the witnessing or participating in the amusement, shall not be
subject to the tax provided for in this chapter, provided, however:
      (1)   Where a fee or charge is comprised of identifiable components,
packages or tiers, the tax provided for herein shall be imposed on any such
components, packages or tiers which provide solely for admission to any
facility and/or the use of any facility or equipment for the purposes of
witnessing or participating in any amusement; and
      (2)   Where a single fee or charge for admission to any facility and/or
the use of any facility or equipment for the purpose of witnessing or
participating in any amusement also entitles the patron of the amusement to the
incidental use of parking, restaurant, bar, refreshment, locker room, changing
room, washroom and/or shower facilities or services, the tax provided for
herein shall be imposed on such fee or charge, provided the predominant
activity of such facility is an amusement, unless an allocation order has been

   (c)   "Person" means any natural individual, firm, organization, society,
foundation, institution, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint

tax shall be in addition to all other taxes imposed by law.
   (b)   Any person subject to the amusement tax imposed herein may separately
itemize and charge to patrons in addition to any admission fee or other charge,

in order to effectuate the proper administration of this chapter, and to assure
the enforcement of the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter. To the

disruptive to the business of the place providing amusements. It shall be
unlawful for any person to prevent, hinder, or interfere with the Commissioner
of Accounts and Finances, the Village Treasurer or their duly designated
deputies or representatives in the discharge of their respective duties in the
performance of this section. It shall be the duty of every owner of a place
which provides amusements to keep accurate and complete books and records to
which the Commissioner of Accounts and Finances, the Village Treasurer or their
respective deputies or representatives shall at all times have full access,
which records shall include a daily sheet showing the amount of gross receipts
received during that day.

next calendar month, (e.g. the return for January shall be due on or before the

billing, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to
the Village upon request. No commission may be claimed by an owner for taxes
not timely remitted to the Village.
(Ord. 2005-09. Passed 4-11-05.)
898.05 TRANSMITTAL OF EXCESS TAX COLLECTIONS.
   If any person collects an amount upon a transaction not subject to the tax
imposed hereby, but which amount is purported to be the collection of said tax,
or if a person collects an amount upon a transaction greater than the amount of
the tax so imposed herein and does not for any reason return the same to the
person who paid the same before filing the return for the period in which such
occurred, said person shall account for and pay over those amounts to the
Village along with the tax properly collected.

charge which is/are attributable to non-amusement items, services or facilities
and the specific portion or portions thereof attributable to amusement items,
services or facilities. From and after the issuance of an allocation order, the
owner of the place which provides amusements shall pay the tax specified
hereinabove, with respect to the subject fee or charge, based only upon the
portion or portions of the subject fee or charge attributable to amusement
items, services or facilities.

of Streets and Public Improvements. The Commissioner shall have supervision
over all work thereon and the cleaning thereof. No additional streets or alleys
shall be created and no existing streets or alleys shall be closed without the
permission of Council.
1020.02 VACATIONS.
   (a)   Application. Property owners considering making a request for the
vacation of Village right-of-way adjacent to their property should first
consult with Village staff regarding procedures, codes, feasibility, price, and
other related information before completing an application for said vacation.
Upon receipt of the completed application, the Village staff shall schedule a
public hearing by the Plan Commission in conformance with public hearing
requirements in Sections
1262.09 and
1262.10 of the Village Code.
(Adopting Ordinance)
   (b)   Feasibility. Village staff shall evaluate, and the Plan Commission
shall make findings in regard to, the potential future use of the right-of-way
for street, alley, trail, recreation, buffer, utilities, drainage, flood
control, environmental protection, or any other public purposes, which may or
may not be addressed in the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the Village, that
would be lost if the right-of-way were to be vacated and turned over to private
use. The Plan Commission shall make a recommendation in regard to the proposed
vacation, which shall be forwarded to the Village Council.
   (c)   Offer/Price. The Village Council shall determine whether to offer to
vacate the right-of-way, subject to the retention of any easements deemed to be
in the public interest, including, but not limited to, utility easements,
conservation easements, and pathway easements.
      (1)   In cases where the request is for the vacation of one-half of the
right-of-way along one side of a single-family lot, and the vacation would not
result in the creation of a new, additional, buildable single-family lot, the
consideration to be paid to the Village in regard to such right-of-way vacation
shall be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000).
      (2)   In cases where the request is for the vacation of both halves of
the right-of-way along one side of a single-family lot, where the result would
not be the creation of a new, additional, buildable single-family lot, the
adjacent property owners shall each be given the opportunity to request
vacation of one-half of the right-of-way, with the consideration to be paid to
the Village by each adjacent property owner, in regard to such right-of-way
vacation, to be twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). If one of the adjacent
property owners declines to proceed with the vacation of one-half of the right-
of-way adjacent to said property owner's property, then said other adjacent
property owner may proceed with the vacation of the full right-of-way, with the
consideration to be paid to the Village in regard to such full right-of-way
vacation to be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). In the case of such a full
right-of-way vacation request by only one adjacent owner, the entire right-of-
way shall be vacated to only the adjacent owner who pays the thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000).
      (3)   In cases where the request is for the vacation of right-of-way that
would result in the creation of a new, additional, buildable single-family lot,
the consideration to be paid the Village shall be determined on a case-by-case
basis, by the Village Council, with the benefit of an appraisal prepared at the
direction of the Village, provided the property owner requesting said vacation
deposits the estimated appraisal cost with the Village prior to the Village
proceeding with the appraisal.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the fact that a proposed right-of-way vacation is
subject to subsection (3) above, in the event that the owner(s) of the property
that is adjacent to the right-of-way to be vacated (hereinafter the "adjacent
property"), who will obtain title to the right-of-way upon vacation thereof
(hereinafter the "adjacent owner"), has indicated in writing to the Village
that said adjacent owner does not presently desire to create the new,
additional, buildable single-family lot, the consideration to be paid for said
right-of-way vacation shall be as set forth in subsection (1) or (2) above;
provided, however, that the adjacent owner consents to the creation of a
covenant running with the land, in a form acceptable to the Village, that
provides for the payment, by the owner of record of the adjacent property,
prior to the approval of any subdivision or tax division that creates a new,
additional, buildable single-family lot, using all or any portion of the
adjacent property and/or the vacated right-of-way, of the difference between
the consideration to be paid for the right-of-way that was vacated, as
determined pursuant to subsection (3) above as of the date of the filing of the
subdivision or tax division petition that would create a new, additional,
buildable single-family lot, and the amount paid by the adjacent owner at the
time of the vacation of the right-of-way.
   The dollar amounts set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) above, shall be
subject to periodic review and adjustment by amendment to this section.
   (d)   Acceptance. Upon the property owner agreeing to pay the consideration
set forth within subsection (c) above, the Village shall cause the necessary
plats and other documents to be prepared for vacation of the right-of-way,
provided the property owner first deposits with the Village the amount
estimated by the Village to cover the costs for document and plat preparation,
recording costs, and all third party fees necessary to complete the
transaction, pursuant to
Chapter 208 of the Village Code.

Village.

jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   (b)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (c)   Facilities Subject to This Chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (d)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (e)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (f)   Conflicts with Other Sections of the Village Code. This chapter
supersedes all sections of the Village Code adopted prior hereto that are in
conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
   (g)   Conflicts with State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable
Federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating Federal or State laws or regulations.
   (h)   Sound Engineering Judgment. The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

1030.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of
Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and
regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (b)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed,
used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
ten days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
twenty-five days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in
the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section
1030.04, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five days after
submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village, provided
the holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (c)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with
such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (d)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with Section
1030.21. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.08 INSURANCE.
   (a)   Required Coverages and Limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the Village, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in paragraphs (a)(1)A. and B. hereof:
         A.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
            2.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
         B.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with
a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
         C.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
         D.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this chapter.
   (b)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (c)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the Village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   (d)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or
not to renew."
   Within ten days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no event
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (e)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) hereof. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under subsection (a) hereof, or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) or (d)
hereof. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) hereof,
such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers
Compensation Act.
   (f)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (g)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this chapter
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.10 SECURITY.
   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   (d)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen days' advance written notice
clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the
fourteen day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (e)   Replenishment. Within fourteen days after receipt of written notice
from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in subsection
(c) hereof.
   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (c) hereof.
   (g)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.11 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this chapter;
      (3)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (b)   Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The Village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this section.
   (c)   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or
Suspension.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:
         A.   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
         B.   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         C.   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such removal to
the Village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
      (2)   The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in this section.
   (d)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection (a)
hereof.
   (e)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) hereof, the Village or its
designee may, at the option of the Village:
      (1)   Correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   Upon not less than twenty days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   After not less than thirty days notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village.
The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of
removal.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (a)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less
than thirty days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (b)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village's right-
of-way.
   (c)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.13 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in the following IDOT publications, as amended from
time to time:
      (1)   Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction;

   (c)   Interference with Traffic. All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Notice When Access is Blocked. At least forty-eight hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the utility shall notify the resident, business or
institution of the approximate beginning time and duration of such work;
provided, however, that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to
Section
1030.20, the utility shall provide such notice as is practicable under the
circumstances.
   (e)   Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the Village.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   General Requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this subsection
(a).
      (1)   No interference with Village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
Village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the Village's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (b)   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         A.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line
and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole alignment
will permit;
         B.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the
curb, where available;
         C.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         D.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         E.   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         A.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         B.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         C.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (c)   Facilities Crossing Highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         A.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC's
rules entitled, "Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines" (83
Ill. Adm. Code 305);
         B.   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         C.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         A.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         B.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (d)   Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (e)   Freestanding Facilities.
      (1)   The Village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The Village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (f)   Facilities Installed Above Ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (g)   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         A.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         B.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         C.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         D.   The proposed method of attachment;

(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.16 CONSTRUCTION METHODS AND MATERIALS.
   (a)   Standards and Requirements for Particular Types of Construction
Methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.
         A.   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the Director
of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall
be excavated no more than forty-eight hours in advance of boring or jacking
operations and backfilled within forty-eight hours after boring or jacking
operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly marked and
protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected, supported, braced,
and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical and lateral loads
that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking operation.
         B.   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         C.   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six
inches (0.15 m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25 mm).
         D.   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches
or less in diameter may be accomplished by either jacking, guided with auger,
or auger and following pipe method.
         E.   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the Village to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accord with the applicable
portions of Section 603 of IDOT's "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction."

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Director of Public Works.
         B.   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         C.   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the Village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         A.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction." When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         B.   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility, at its expense, shall
remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility,
place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement,
sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the
Director of Public Works.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this paragraph is
permitted under Section
1030.21, the following requirements shall apply:
         A.   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Director of Public Works.
         B.   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the Village.
         C.   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         D.   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         A.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
Village.
         B.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         C.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         D.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty psig or less, encasement
may be eliminated.
         E.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair, and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         F.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

   (b)   Other Utilities – Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (c)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

a utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or
permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any
utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is
reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation
of any Village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or
upon, the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or

satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.
   (b)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (c)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (d)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (e)   Right to Appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter, shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Council, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within thirty days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The Village Council shall commence its consideration
of the appeal at the Village Council's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village
Council shall timely decide the appeal.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)

(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.23 SEVERABILITY.
   If any subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this chapter is
for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and
independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof.
(Ord. 2007-45. Passed 10-22-07.)
1030.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the general penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the
Village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because
the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 C.F.R. 22.970 through 47 C.F.R.
22.973 and 47 C.F.R. 90.672 through 47 C.F.R. 90.675. The burden to establish
the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely
deliver to the Village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to
resolve the interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations
sections cited above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein
shall constitute a public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be

Chapter 1030 (Construction of Utility Facilities in the Rights-of-Way) of this
code, to allow a small wireless facility to be located above ground in an area
where Village ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground
facilities if, in addition to demonstrating the conditions of Section
1030.21 have been established, the wireless provider can establish that:
         A.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no
reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way;
         B.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
         C.   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location

decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the Village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the Village shall
either:
         A.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         B.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   (f)   Collocation Limits: Wireless providers shall not collocate small
wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an electric
distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone
of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.

adopted pursuant to the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation
Act or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 54 U.S.C. Section 300101
et seq., and the regulations adopted to implement those laws.

dollars ($200.00) per year per pole, with rates to be determined upon final
resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 2018-25. Passed 8-13-18.)
1032.17 INDEMNIFICATION.
   Other than for liabilities and losses due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the Village or its employees or agents, a wireless provider shall

whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the Village infrastructure or
improvements, or right-of-way associated with such infrastructure or
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the

         The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and shall provide
certificates of insurance and proof of inclusion of the Village in a commercial
general liability policy to the Village prior to the collocation of any small
wireless facility, and shall keep updated certificates and proof of inclusion
on file with the Village at all times that the provider maintains small
wireless facilities within the Village.
   (d)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limits required by the Village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement that the Village be named an additional insured. A wireless
provider that self-insures shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance limits required
by the Village.

integrity and aesthetics of such facilities. Small wireless facilities shall
not appear to be unkempt. In the event of a failure to properly maintain such
facilities, the Village shall notify the wireless provider, in writing, who
shall have thirty (30) days to correct the identified maintenance violation. If
not corrected within such period, the Village reserves the right to take such
action as it deems necessary, including revocation of the permit. Maintenance
and replacement of small wireless facilities shall be performed by the wireless
provider at the wireless provider's sole cost and expense.
   (b)   In the event of an emergency involving an imminent threat to life or

   (a)   A permit to collocate a small wireless facility may be revoked for one
or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   The wireless provider obtained approval by means of fraud or made a
misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to the permit application, or
any required documentation or submittal.

setting forth the basis for the revocation. The wireless provider shall, within
fourteen (14) days of the notice of revocation, file a written response with
the Public Works Director setting forth the reasons why the permit should not
be revoked along with such evidence in opposition to the revocation as the
wireless provider determines necessary. Failure to file a response with the
Public Works Director shall be deemed an admission of the facts set forth in
the notification of written notification and shall result in automatic
revocation of the permit. The Public Works Director shall render findings and a
decision within twenty-one (21) days of the date of receipt of the wireless
provider's response, if any.

Road (96th Avenue) on the west, 127th Street on the north, 92nd Avenue on the
east and 131st Street on the south.
      (2)   Area #2 (Central): That portion of the Village located between
102nd Avenue on the west and LaGrange Road (96th Avenue) on the east, along
with that portion of the Village bounded by LaGrange Road (96th Avenue) on the

the south.
      (3)   Area #3 (West): That portion of the Village located West of 102nd
Avenue.
   (b)   Connection Fee (Multifamily Residential/Planned Unit Developments).
One fourth of the applicable connection fee for a single-family residence, as
set forth in subsection (a) above, per dwelling unit.
   (c)   Connection Fee (Commercial/Industrial).
      (1)   Where the commercial/industrial use is not a food service/
preparation use or a use which processes water, and the average water usage is
not anticipated to exceed 7,500 gallons per month, the connection fee shall be
the same as for a single-family residence, as set forth in subsection (a)
above, plus five hundred dollars ($500.00) per fixture.
      (2)   Where the commercial/industrial use is not a food service/
preparation use or a use which processes water, and the average water usage is
anticipated to exceed 7,500 gallons per month, but not be more than 11,250
gallons per month, the connection fee shall be based upon the following
formula, plus five hundred dollars ($500.00) per fixture:
            Applicable connection fee      The anticipated
            for a single-family residence x   monthly water =   Connection
            as set forth in subsection      usage in gallons   Fee
            (a) above            7,500
      (3)   For all commercial/industrial uses which are not covered by either
subsection (c)(1) or (2) above, the connection fee shall be one and one-half
times the applicable connection fee for a single-family residence, as set forth
in subsection (a) above, plus five hundred dollars ($500.00) per fixture.
   (d)   While it is the intent of the Village Council to review the foregoing
connection fees during the first quarter of 2021, in the event the Village
Council fails to do so, the connection fees that will go into effect on May 1,
2021 shall equal one hundred one percent of the connection fees in effect on
April 30, 2021 (rounded to the nearest dollar amount), with an additional one
percent increase in the connection fees (based on the previous year’s
connection fees) going into effect each May 1st thereafter (rounded to the
nearest whole dollar amount), until such time as this section is further
amended.
   (e)   The connection fees provided for by this subsection shall not include
the cost of extending the Village’s sanitary sewer system to service any
development, which cost shall be the responsibility of the developer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon approval by the Village Council, the
Village may accept a donation of construction, expansion or extension of the
Village’s sanitary sewer system in lieu of all or part of the connection fees
established by this section.
   (f)   For purposes of subsection (c) above, a commercial/industrial use
shall be deemed to “process water” if the use of water is for other than the
normal uses of water by a single-family residence (i.e. bathroom, basic
cleaning, domestic kitchen use, watering of plants/grass, etc.). In the event
that a question arises as to whether a commercial/industrial use “processes
water,” the Commissioner of Public Works shall make the final determination.
   (g)   In the event that a property owner is unable to pay the connection
fee, as referenced in subsection (a) above, in one lump sum payment, said
property owner can pay said connection fee over up to a ten (10) year period.
If a property owner chooses to pay the connection fee other than in one lump
sum, an initial payment, equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the amount of
the connection fee, shall be made by said property owner, with the remainder of
the connection fee being paid pursuant to bi-monthly payments as part of the
bi-monthly water and sanitary sewer bill, with simple interest on the unpaid
balance accruing at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum until the entire
connection fee is paid. Failure to make any bi-monthly connection fee payment,
including any interest payment, shall subject the non-paying party to the
billing penalty and discontinuation of service provisions of Sections
1040.271 and
1050.01. Where a property owner chooses to pay the connection fee other than in
a lump sum payment, a lien shall be recorded against said property owner's
property to evidence the connection fee that is owed, as well as the payment
terms. The cost for recording and releasing said lien shall be added to said
property owner's water and sanitary sewer bill, and failure to pay same shall
subject the non-paying party to the billing penalty and discontinuation of
service provisions of Sections
1040.271 and
1050.01.

      (12)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or which are
amenable to treatment only to such a degree that the sewage treatment plan
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   (d)   Remedial Actions by Commissioner of Public Works and Streets. If any
waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public
sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in subsection (c) hereof, and/or are in violation of the standards
for pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June 26, 1978, and any amendment
thereto, and which waters, in the judgment of the Commissioner of Public Works
and Streets or his or her designated representative, may have a deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Commissioner of Public Works and Streets or his or her designated
representative may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or

the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of subsection (h) hereof.
    If the Commissioner of Public Works and Streets or his or her designated
representative permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Commissioner of Public Works and Streets or his or
her designated representative and to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances and laws.
   (e)   Interceptors Required. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be
provided when, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Public Works and Streets
or his or her designated representative, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such
interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
Commissioner of Public Works and Streets or his or her designated
representative and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
   (f)   Preliminary Treatment or Flow-Equalizing Facilities. Where preliminary
treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his or her
expense.
   (g)   Control Manholes. Each industry shall be required to install a control
manhole and, when required by the Commissioner of Public Works and Streets or
his or her designated representative, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable  control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Commissioner of
Public Works and Streets or his or her designated representative. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his or her expense and shall be maintained
by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (h)   Laboratory Measurements, Tests and Analyses.
      (1)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the Village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
      (2)   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be
performed by the owner shall be as stipulated by the Village, but no less than
once per year the industry shall supply a complete analysis of the constituents
of the wastewater discharge to assure that the same are in compliance with
Federal, State and local standards. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the Village at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the Village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the Village. At such times as
deemed necessary, the Village reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
      (3)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of the IEPA Division of
Laboratories Manual of Laboratory Methods and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided or based upon suitable samples taken at such control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine
whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but
not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four
hour composites of all outfalls, where pH's are determined from periodic grab
samples.
   (i)   Special Agreements or Arrangements. Nothing contained in this chapter
shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between
the Village and any industrial concern, whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
payment therefor by the industrial concern, provided that such payments are in
accordance with Federal and State guidelines for the user charge system.

   The first tank of any private sewage disposal system shall be not closer
than twenty-five feet to the main residence. All systems and parts thereof
shall meet or exceed the standards set by the Illinois Private Sewage Disposal
Licensing Act and Code and by the National Sanitation Foundation.
   All wastewater, including that from floor drains, must discharge through the
sand filter and chlorinator. Effective run-off of the discharge shall be
provided. Sump pumps handling drainage tile, downspouts and the discharge from
water softeners and filtration equipment shall not discharge into the private
disposal system.
(Ord. 1984-22. Passed 12-10-84.)
1042.08 SPECIFICATIONS FOR REPLACEMENTS.
   When it becomes necessary to replace an old private sewage disposal system,
the specifications set forth in Section
1042.07 shall apply, except that the old tank may be used if it is in good
condition and if the 500-gallon capacity for the initial settling tank is met.
If such system cannot be installed due to drainage, run-off, lot size,
topography or soil conditions, then variations shall be considered individually
on the merit of each application.
   If requests for enlarging or repairing a leach field are made, permission
therefor shall be granted only at the owner's risk and with the full
understanding that if the repairs do not work, further repair or replacement
with an aerobic system shall be required. A new field or addition shall be
installed in a virgin area.
(Ord. 1984-22. Passed 12-10-84.)
1042.09 ROOM ADDITIONS.
   When building permits for room additions providing additional living space
are requested, a review of the private sewage disposal system and its ability
to handle more waste water shall be a major factor in the issuance of the
building permit. If there is doubt as to the ability of the system to handle
the additional waste water, then the system must be corrected prior to the
issuance of a building permit.
(Ord. 1973-7. Passed 9-24-73; Ord. 1984-22. Passed 12-10-84.)
1042.10 AEROBIC DIGESTION SYSTEM DEFINED.
   "Aerobic digestion system" means an activated sludge unit for the disposal
of sewage with an aeration compartment providing for either mechanical
aeration, diffused air or a combination thereof.
(Ord. 1973-7. Passed 9-24-73.)
1042.11 CONSTRUCTION OF AEROBIC SYSTEMS.
   In the construction of aerobic digestion systems:
   (a)   All tanks shall be of watertight construction, constructed of
materials resistant to excessive corrosion or decay, properly reinforced and of
sufficient thickness to withstand expected earth and hydrostatic pressures when
both full and empty, and completed to present a smooth inside finish free of
spalls, honeycomb, pits, etc.
   (b)   The design and installation of aerobic systems shall be such that each
unit must be set level and at the correct elevation. The sound level of the
unit in operation shall not be such as to constitute a nuisance.
   (c)   The aeration compartment shall have a minimum holding capacity of 850
gallons. The shape and design of the tank inlet and outlet arrangements,
compartmentation, baffling and air application shall be such as to:
      (1)   Allow for intimate mixing of the applied oxygen;
      (2)   Prevent excessive short-circuiting of flow;
      (3)   Prevent the deposit of solids in any portion of the compartment;
      (4)   Prevent excessive accumulation of foam anywhere in the system; and
      (5)   Enable the system to operate as a septic tank in case of mechanical
or electrical failure.
   This would necessitate an opening equivalent to a four-inch pipe between the

it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation, using Lake Michigan
water in relation to a property with an odd address, to use Lake Michigan water
on both the 31st day of May, July and/or August and on the 1st day of the next

Michigan water for outdoor watering on consecutive days. New lawns, which are
less than three (3) months old, shall be exempt from the foregoing
restrictions. In addition, new/replacement sprinkler systems shall be equipped
with a WaterSense labeled irrigation controller and shall be in compliance with

exigencies require such action. If public exigencies so require, the Mayor may
unilaterally take such action prior to the earliest opportunity available for
consultation with Council.
   (c)   Whenever the Mayor and Council limit or suspend the use of water for
the sprinkling or irrigation of lawns and gardens or for any other special
purpose, no person shall use water for the sprinkling or irrigation of lawns
and gardens or for any other special purpose designated, other than during the
times allowed for such uses of water, provided that such person has been given
notice by the Village, by telephone, U.S. mail, or personal service, of such
limitation on or the suspension of the use of water.

each water meter.
   (e)   Responsibility for Repairs; Liability for Damage. The cost of keeping
each water meter in repair shall be paid by the person upon whose application
such meter was installed or repaired, as soon as the bill therefor is
presented. Such person shall be liable for any breakage, loss or damage to such
meter, however caused, except by ordinary use and wear. The cost of making good
such loss or damage shall be paid by such person as soon as the bill therefor
is presented. The amount thereof shall be a lien against the premises for which
such meter was installed to the extent of, and with the same effect as, water
rates.
   (f)   Replacements. If a water meter becomes worn out and unfit for use, the
consumer shall be required to have a new meter installed.

of maintenance and operation of the waterworks, depreciation of the same, and
payment of the principal and interest on any revenue bonds that may be issued
by the Village for the construction, installation, repair and improvement of
the system.

         A.   Area #1 (East): That portion of the Village located east of
LaGrange Road (96th Avenue), except that portion thereof bounded by LaGrange
Road (96th Avenue) on the west, 127th Street on the north, 92nd Avenue on the
east and 131st Street on the south.
         B.   Area #2 (Central): That portion of the Village located between

the south.
         C.   Area #3 (West): That portion of the Village located west of 102nd
Avenue.
      (2)   Connection fee (multifamily residential/planned unit developments).
One fourth of the applicable connection fee for a single-family residence, as
set forth in subsection (g)(1) above, per dwelling unit.
      (3)   Connection fee (commercial/industrial):
         A.   Where the commercial/industrial use is not a food service/
preparation use or a use which processes water, and the average water usage is
not anticipated to exceed 7,500 gallons per month, the connection fee shall be
the same as for a single-family residence, as set forth in subsection (g)(1)
above.
         B.   Where the commercial/industrial use is not a food service/
preparation use or a use which processes water, and the average water usage is
anticipated to exceed 7,500 gallons per month, but not be more than 11,250
gallons per month, the connection fee shall be based upon the following
formula:
            Applicable connection fee      The anticipated
            for a single-family residence   x   monthly water   =   Connection
Fee
            as set forth in subsection      usage in gallons
            (g)(1) above               7,500
         C.   For all commercial/industrial uses which are not covered by
either subsection (g)(3)A. or B. above, the connection fee shall be one and
one-half times the applicable connection fee for a single-family residence, as
set forth in subsection (g)(1) above.
      (4)   While it is the intent of the Village Council to review the
foregoing connection fees during the first quarter of 2021, in the event the
Village Council fails to do so, the connection fees that will go into effect on
May 1, 2021 shall equal one hundred one percent of the connection fees in
effect on April 30, 2021 (rounded to the nearest dollar amount), with an
additional one percent increase in the connection fees (based on the previous
year’s connection fees) going into effect each May 1st thereafter (rounded to
the nearest whole dollar amount), until such time as this subsection (g) is
further amended.
      (5)   The connection fees provided for by this subsection shall not
include the cost of extending the Village’s water system to service any
development, which cost shall be the responsibility of the developer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon approval by the Village Council, the
Village may accept a donation of construction, expansion or extension of the
Village’s water system in lieu of all or part of the connection fees
established by this section.
      (6)   For purposes of subsection (g)(3) above, a commercial/industrial
use shall be deemed to “process water” if the use of water is for other than
the normal uses of water by a single-family residence (i.e. bathroom, basic
cleaning, domestic kitchen use, watering of plants/grass, etc.). In the event
that a question arises as to whether a commercial/industrial use “processes
water,” the Commissioner of Public Works shall make the final determination.
      (7)   In the event that a property owner is unable to pay the connection
fee, as referenced in subsection (1) above, in one lump sum payment, said
property owner can pay said connection fee over up to a ten (10) year period.
If a property owner chooses to pay the connection fee other than in one lump
sum, an initial payment, equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the amount of
the connection fee, shall be made by said property owner, with the remainder of
the connection fee being paid pursuant to bi-monthly payments as part of the
bi-monthly water and sanitary sewer bill, with simple interest on the unpaid
balance accruing at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum until the entire
connection fee is paid. Failure to make any bi-monthly connection fee payment,
including any interest payment, shall subject the non-paying party to the
billing penalty and discontinuation of service provisions of Sections 1046.35
and 1050.01. Where a property owner chooses to pay the connection fee other
than in a lump sum payment, a lien shall be recorded against said property
owner's property to evidence the connection fee that is owed, as well as the
payment terms. The cost for recording and releasing said lien shall be added to
said property owner's water and sanitary sewer bill, and failure to pay same
shall subject the non-paying party to the billing penalty and discontinuation
of service provisions of Sections
1046.35 and
1050.01.

Village of its utility services, nor shall it preclude the Village from any
other legal or equitable remedies it may have under this Code or otherwise.

pollution by isolating, within the customer's water system, contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system.
         B.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or the consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing substances of unknown or questionable safety.
         C.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination or pollution of the
public and the consumer's potable water systems.
      (2)   Application. These rules and regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public potable water supply system of the Village of
Palos Park.
      (3)   Policy. The owner or official custodian shall be responsible for
protection of the public water supply system from contamination due to backflow
or back-siphonage of contaminants through the customer's water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the Commissioner of Buildings/Superintendent
of Water or his or her authorized representative, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water supply
system, the Commissioner of Buildings/Superintendent of Water shall give notice
to the consumer to install such an approved backflow prevention device at each
service connection to the premises. The consumer shall immediately install such
an approved device or devices at his or her own expense. Failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the consumer to install such a device or devices
immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such device or devices have been installed. The consumer shall
retain records of installation, maintenance, testing and repair as required in
subsection (f) hereof for a period of at least five years. The Commissioner of
Buildings/Superintendent of Water may require the consumer to submit a cross-
connection inspection report to the Village of Palos Park to assist in
determining whether or not service line protection will be required. All cross-
connection inspections shall be conducted by a cross-connection control device
inspector (CCCDI) certified by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

service, or the disconnection and/or reconnection thereof, as well as the

the Village for the additional costs incurred in processing said On Demand
Final Bill. Said fee shall be paid to the Village prior to the Village
proceeding with a final water meter reading and issuance of the On Demand Final

(the "Final Reading Date"), any request to change the Final Reading Date,
relative to the On Demand Final Bill, which occurs after noon on the day prior

(Ord. 1996-06. Passed 4-22-96.)
1052.05 GENERAL COVENANTS.
   The Village covenants as follows:
   (a)   The Village will maintain the system in good repair and working order,
will operate the same efficiently and faithfully, and will punctually perform
all duties with respect thereto required by the Constitution and laws of the
State.
   (b)   The Village will establish and maintain, at all times, reasonable
fees, charges and rates for the use and service of the system and will provide
for the collection thereof and the segregation and application of the revenues
in the manner provided by this chapter, sufficient at all times to pay
operation and maintenance costs and to provide an adequate depreciation fund.
Not less than sixty days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the
Corporate Authorities shall review the fees, charges and rates for the use and
service of the system for sufficiency for such upcoming fiscal year, and such
review shall be based upon a tentative budget of the system done by the
administrative staff of the Village. There shall be charged against all users
of the system, including the Village, such rates and amounts for water service
as shall be adequate to meet the requirements of this subsection. Charges for
services performed for the Village shall be made against the Village, and
payment for the same shall be made monthly from the corporate funds into the
Water Revenue Fund as revenues derived from the operation of the system,
provided, however, that the Village need not charge itself for such services
if, in the previous fiscal year, revenues not including any payments made by
the Village shall have met the requirements of this chapter.
   (c)   The Village, from time to time, will make all needful and proper
repairs, replacements, additions and betterments to the system so that it may,
at all times, be operated properly and advantageously, and when any necessary
equipment or facility is worn out, destroyed or otherwise insufficient for
proper use, it shall be promptly replaced so that the value and efficiency of
the system shall be at all times fully maintained.
   (d)   The Village will establish such rules and regulations for the control
and operation of the system as are necessary for the safe, lawful, efficient
and economical operation thereof.
   (e)   The Village will make and keep proper books and accounts (separate and
apart from all other records and accounts of said Village), in which complete
entries shall be made of all transactions relating to the system, and hereby
covenants that, within 180 days following the close of each fiscal year, it
will cause the books and accounts of the system to be audited by independent
certified public accountants. Said audit will be available for inspection by
the holders of any of the bonds. Each such audit, in addition to whatever
matters may be thought proper by the accounts to be included therein, shall,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, including the following:
      (1)   A statement, in detail, of income and expenditures of the system
for such fiscal year;
      (2)   A balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal year, including a
statement of the amount held in each of the accounts of the Water Revenue Fund;
      (3)   A list of all system insurance policies in force at the end of the
fiscal year, setting out for each policy the amount of the policy, the risks
covered, the name of the insurer and the expiration date of the policy;
      (4)   The number of metered water customers and the number of unmetered
water customers at the end of the year, the quantity of water pumped and the
quantity of water billed;
      (5)   Changes in the cost of purchased water service during such fiscal
year;
      (6)   A summary of rates in effect at the end of such fiscal year for
services of the system and any changes in such rates effective during such
fiscal year.
   All expenses of the audit required by this section shall be regarded and
paid as operation and maintenance costs.
   (f)   The Village will keep the books and accounts for the system in
accordance with generally accepted fund-reporting practices for municipal
enterprise funds, provided, however, that the monthly credits to the
Depreciation Account shall be in cash and said funds shall be held separate and
apart in cash and investments. For the purpose of determining whether
sufficient cash and investments are on deposit in such accounts under the terms
and requirements of this chapter, investments shall be valued at amortized
cost.
   (g)   The Village will carry insurance on the system of the kinds and in the
amounts which are usually carried by private parties operating similar
properties, covering such risks as shall be recommended by a competent
consulting engineer or insurance consultant employed by the Village for the
purpose of making such recommendations. The Village has the option to self-
insure or provide insurance by means of a self-insurance pool with other units
of local government, provided that either private insurance is not available at
a reasonable cost or the Village or the pool shall have assets (including as an
asset the contractual right to draw upon members of the pool), or shall have
created a self-insurance reserve fund, in an amount as shall be determined by a
competent insurance consultant to be not unreasonable in view of the risks
incurred. All moneys received for loss under such insurance policies shall be
deposited to the credit of the Depreciation Account and used in making good the
loss or damage in respect of which they were paid, either by repairing the
property damaged or by replacing the property destroyed, and provision for
making good such loss or damage shall be made within ninety days from the date
of the loss. The payment of premiums for all insurance policies required under
the provisions of this covenant shall be considered an operation and
maintenance cost. The proceeds derived from any and all such policies for
workers' compensation or public liability shall be paid into the Operation and
Maintenance Account and used in paying the claims on account of which they were
received.
   (h)   Except as hereinabove expressly provided for services to the Village,
the Village covenants not to provide any free service of the system, and, to
the extent permitted by law, the Village will not grant a franchise for the
operation of any competing waterworks system within the Village.
   (i)   The Village will adopt a budget for the Water Revenue Fund prior to
the beginning of each fiscal year, subject to applicable State law, providing
for payment of all sums to be due in the fiscal year so as to comply with the
terms of this chapter and of long-term water supply agreements. The budget may
include in its estimate of income the use of available capital moneys or other
funds of the Village appropriated for the purpose. If, during the fiscal year,
there are extraordinary unbudgeted receipts or payments of unusual cost, the
Village will adopt an amended budget for the remainder of the fiscal year,
providing for receipts or payments pursuant to this chapter.

of the required land improvements shall be in accordance with cost estimates
approved by Council. If a completion bond or deposit of cash or other security
or guarantee is posted, there shall be good and sufficient surety thereon, as
approved by Council, and it shall be in such form as approved by the Village
Attorney and conditioned upon the installation of the improvements and payment
of inspection fees within two years following the approval of the final plat.

fees. Any unused balance shall be returned to the depositor. There shall be no
reduction of that portion of the bond or other guarantee or deposit applying to
a particular improvement, unless or until that improvement is complete and
accepted or approved by Council, except that upon the completion of the
subgrade, base course and one-half of the thickness of the wearing surface
course of a street or parking area, Council may reduce that amount of that
portion of the bond or other guarantee or deposit covering such land
improvements, but such reduction shall not be more than an amount equal to
ninety percent of the estimated cost of installation of the subgrade and base
course.
   (d)   Certification of Approval. The Village Clerk shall not certify the
approval of Council on the final plat until the required bond or deposit of
cash or other security or guarantee has been filed as required by this section.

transportation facilities and libraries, to serve the immediate and future
needs of the residents of the subdivision or development, as follows:
   (a)   Purpose. The Village requires the donation of land and payment of fees
to help alleviate the impact of growth on the cost of providing adequate local
government services. The amount of the land donation and fee payment is
intended to be the fair share of the average initial land and capital costs of
park, school, library, and transportation services by local government
proportionate to the size of the development, and specifically and uniquely
attributable to the development. Operations and maintenance costs are not to be
covered by exaction fees.
   (b)   Applicability. Property owners become vested or obligated for the
donation of land and payment of fees at the time of the Village's approval of
an annexation, plat of subdivision within the Village and within the Village
jurisdiction in unincorporated areas within 1.5 miles of the Village, planned
unit development plan, special use, or building permit, whichever occurs first.
Fees are to be paid to the Village upon issuance of each building permit, or
earlier if agreed by the developer and the Village.
   (c)   Land Donation.
      (1)   Determination. The Village and the elementary and high school
districts shall determine whether land is needed within the proposed
development area for the provision of services. The size and location of the
land to be donated shall be based on the Village Comprehensive Plan or by the
service needs as determined by the Village and the elementary and high school
districts and the suitability of the land. Suitability shall be based on the
conditions of the land in terms of the shape of lot, soils, slope, vegetation,
environmental quality, environmental amenity, other natural existing features,
relationship to surrounding land uses and infrastructure, and compatibility
with the development.
      (2)   Park land formula. The required land donation for parks shall be
calculated using the average number of persons per household as shown in Table
A below and the rate of acres per population as shown in Table B below. The
Village may consider using different averages for Table A that are supported by
data submitted by the developer or school district and determined by the
Village to be accurate.
      (3)   School land formula. The required land donation for schools shall
be calculated using the average number of students per household as shown in
Table A and the rate of acres per student as shown in Table C. The Village may
consider using different averages for Table A or different rates for Table C
that are supported by data submitted by the developer or school district and
determined by the Village to be accurate.
      (4)   Land formula for other services. There is no land donation formula
in this Code for library or transportation services.
      (5)   Excess. If the amount of land to be donated exceeds the amount
required by the formula in this subsection for that one particular development,
then the Village or the elementary or high school district shall pay the
property owner current fair market value for that particular excess amount of
land or a lesser amount subject to an agreement with the property owner, the
Village, and the school district if applicable.

      (6)   Examples of land donation calculations.
         A.   Acres of park land donation required is a ratio of five (5) acres
of neighborhood parks and five (5) acres of community parks for every one
thousand (1,000) population as shown in Table B. This ratio is the same as .01
acre for one (1) person, which is ten (10) divided by 1,000. The number of
residents in a four (4) bedroom single family house is 3.559 as shown in Table
A. Park land donation required for a four (4) bedroom single family house is
.01 acre per one (1) person times 3.559 people in the house equals .03559
acres.
         Park land donation for twenty (20), three (3) bedroom townhouses = 20
x .01 x 2.374 = .475 acres.
         B.   Acres of elementary school (grades K through 5 only) land
donation required is a ratio of fifteen (15) acres for every six hundred fifty
(650) students in grades K through 5 as shown in Table C. This ratio is the
same as .023 acres for one (1) student, which is fifteen (15) divided by six
hundred fifty (650). The average number of K through 5 students in a four (4)
bedroom single family house is .702 as shown in Table A. Elementary school land
donation required for a four (4) bedroom single family house is .023 acres for
one (1) student times .702 students in the house equals .017 acres.
         Elementary school land donation for twenty (20) three bedroom
townhouses = 20 x .023 x .104 = .048 acres
   (d)   Land Fee. If the determination is made by the Village that land is not
to be donated, the developer shall pay a fee in lieu of land donation otherwise
required for that particular development. The fee in lieu of land donation is
based on an estimated average fair market value of land in the Palos Park
market area at the rate of ninety thousand dollars ($90,000) per acre. The
Village may consider using a different average value of land that is supported
by data submitted by the developer or school district and determined by the
Village to be accurate.
   (e)   Park and School Capital Fees. In addition to a land donation or land
fee, the developer is required to pay a capital fee, which is intended to cover
estimated average costs of planning, design, and construction to make a site
useable for a park or school buildings and facilities, including but not
limited to grading, stormwater management, and utilities. The capital fee is
based on the estimated average site preparation costs of sixty-four thousand
dollars ($64,000) per acre of land calculated to be donated. The Village may
consider using a different average that is supported by data submitted by the
developer or school district and determined by the Village to be accurate.
   (f)   Capital Credits. If the developer donates a park or school site that
is acceptable to the Village, and that already has sufficient capital
improvements as determined by the Village, then the Village may reduce or
delete the capital fee otherwise required.
   (g)   Transportation Capital Fee. The developer shall be required to pay a
transportation capital fee, which is intended to cover estimated average costs
of planning, design, land acquisition, construction, and landscaping for
transportation facilities including roads, paths, transit, lighting, signs,
signals, and related equipment. The fee shall be in addition to the
transportation land dedications and improvements otherwise required by the
State, County, Township, and Village to provide direct access up to and within
the proposed development site. Said transportation capital fee shall be
calculated as follows:
      (1)   Two thousand six hundred fifty-seven dollars and thirty-four cents
($2,657.34) per household or dwelling unit.
      (2)   One dollar and sixty cents ($1.60) per gross square feet of
buildings used for offices.
      (3)   Two dollars and five cents ($2.05) per gross square feet of
buildings used for commercial uses and uses other than residential and office.
   (h)   Library Capital Fee. The developer shall be required to pay a library
capital fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250) per household or dwelling unit,
which is intended to cover the estimated average costs of planning, design,
construction, permanent fixtures and related equipment for library building and
grounds.
   (i)   School Land Fees and Capital Fees Distribution. Fees collected by the
Village for schools shall be transmitted to the school districts frequently,
subject to an intergovernmental agreement for responsible accounting and
indemnification.
   (j)   Fee Increases. The average land values and average site preparation
costs for school and park exactions and the capital fees for transportation and
library used in this section shall be increased by two and one-half percent
(2.5%) every year on the anniversary date of the 2009 amendment to this
Section. (12/14/09)
   (k)   Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of the
exaction fees imposed in this section:
      (1)   Alterations or expansion of an existing dwelling unit where no
additional units are created and the use is not changed;
      (2)   The construction of accessory buildings or structures which are not
dwelling units and which do not constitute an increase in intensity of use; and
      (3)   The replacement of a destroyed or partially destroyed building or
structure with a new building or structure of approximately the same size and
the same use.
   (l)   Indemnification of Village by School Districts. The affected school
district shall be required, as a condition of receiving the donations provided
in this section, to indemnify and hold harmless the Village from any loss,
claims and causes of actions of every kind incurred by the Village as a result,
either directly or indirectly, of the passage of this section, or the
administration or enforcement thereof, including any loss, claims and causes of
actions of every kind so incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought or
threatened by a subdivider or developer. If the Village is sued by any
subdivider or developer as a result, directly or indirectly, of the passage of
this section, the affected school district may, at its option, undertake the
defense thereof, but all costs and expenses of such defense, including
attorneys fees, shall then be borne by the affected school district.

Passed 12-14-09.)
1244.08 ACCEPTANCE AND GUARANTEE OF STREETS.
   (a)   Acceptance. If any plat of a subdivision contains public streets or
thoroughfares which are therein dedicated as such, whether located within the
corporate limits of the Village or in part outside  thereof, or contains
streets located outside of the corporate limits, the approval of the plat by
Council or the subsequent annexation of the property to the Village shall not
constitute an acceptance for maintenance, clearing and cleaning purposes
irrespective of any act by an officer, agent or employee of the Village with
respect to such streets or improvements.
   The acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares for maintenance shall be
made only by the adoption of a resolution by Council after there has been filed
with the Village Clerk a certification by the Village Engineer certifying that
improvements required to be constructed or installed in or upon such streets or
thoroughfares, in connection with the approval of the final plat of the
subdivision by Council, have been completed and the construction or
installation thereof has been approved by him or her. The developer may request
acceptance of such streets or thoroughfares for maintenance, clearing and
cleaning after fifty-one percent of nonroadway improvements has been made and
the Village shall accept such improvements subject to the guarantee stated in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Guarantee. The developer shall guarantee the construction quality of
all roadway and nonroadway improvements for a period of one year after
completion of each.
1244.09 PLATS OF CONSOLIDATION.
   (a)   A plat of consolidation is defined as a plat which combines one (1) or
more existing lots of record, in whole or in part, into a single lot of record.
   (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter which would
require the Plan Commission to take action in regard to a proposed plat of
subdivision, a plat of consolidation may be submitted directly to, and approved
directly by, the Village Council, without need to bring said plat of
consolidation before the Plan Commission, provided the lot created by said plat
of consolidation is in full compliance with all Village Code requirements.

made, within such time as is prescribed by the Board by a general rule, by
filing, with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board, a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, together with such plats and
exhibits as are reasonably necessary. Such appeal shall be taken upon forms
provided by the Board. The Village Clerk shall forthwith transmit to the Board

amend the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from to the
extent and in the manner that the Board may decide to be fitting and proper in
the premises, and to that end the Board shall also have all the powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of
the Board is necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Commissioner or to decide in favor of the applicant any
matter upon which it is authorized by this Zoning Code to render decisions.
1264.04 VARIANCES.

Ord. 2021-30. Passed 11-22- 21; Ord. 2022-19. Passed 11-14-22.)
1264.05 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCES.
   Except as provided in Section 1220.05 of this Code, an application for a
variance of this Zoning Code may be made by a property owner, or his or her
agent, to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Such application shall be made in
writing, stating the variance requested, the location of the property for which
the variance is requested, the name of the property owner and the cause of the
requested variance.
(Ord. 2014-19. Passed 8-25-14.)
1264.06 REVIEW OF APPLICATION AND NOTICE.
   All requests for zoning variances shall be reviewed by Village staff for
completeness, and then forwarded in a timely manner to the Zoning Board of
Appeals, who shall consider said request at a public hearing, and make
recommendations to the applicant and to the Village Council, who shall approve
or deny said request. The notices and public hearing procedures shall conform
to Section
1262.10 of the Village Code.
(Ord. 2010-06. Passed 2-8-10.)
1264.07 REPORT OF FINDINGS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall report its findings and recommendations in
writing to Council within thirty days from the conclusion of the public
hearing. In considering all proposed variances to this Zoning Code, the Board
shall, before recommending that Council grant a variance, first determine and
make a finding of fact that the proposed variance will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate practical
difficulties or a demonstrable hardship in the way of carrying out the strict
letter of those regulations relating to the use, construction, or alteration of
buildings or structures or the use of land, and that:
   (a)   Site Conditions. There are one or more unusual physical conditions of
the site, such as size, shape, or slope, that were not created by a person
having an interest in the property, that are unavoidable or uncorrectable, or
that are worthy of preservation, such as a creek, wetland, or specimen trees,
and that make it a substantial burden to use the property or develop the
property, or otherwise result in a substantial loss of value or cause the site
to be unable to yield a reasonable return, without a variance.
   (b)   Development Design. The variation would not merely serve the temporary
social or personal convenience of an occupant, and an alternative development
plan that would conform to Code would not be suitable for the uses permitted by
Code and would not be typical of similar properties in the area.
   (c)   Community Impact. The variation would retain the essential character,
scale, intensity, and open space of the area, and would be in harmony with the
purposes of the Zoning Code as stated in Section
1260.02 of this Code, and would not be substantially injurious to other
property, or be detrimental to public interests or adopted Village plans.
   In addition, the Board shall look to, and make findings of fact in regard
to, those factors set forth in Section
1260.05(b)(1) through (6) in regard to the requested variation. Such findings
of fact shall be incorporated in the written report to Council.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend certain limited conditions on the
development subject to the variance that are necessary or appropriate to reduce
the impact or injurious effect of said variance and to better carry out the
general intent of the Village regulations.
(Adopting Ordinance; Ord. 1996-22. Passed 9-9-96; Ord. 2011-15. Passed 4-11-11;
Ord. 2011-16. Passed 4-11-11.)
1264.08 ACTION BY COUNCIL ON VARIANCES.
   Upon receipt of the report and recommendations from the Zoning Board of
Appeals to grant or deny a variance, Council, without further public hearing,
may approve the variance, deny the variance or refer it back to the Board for
further consideration. In approving a variance, the Council may impose certain
limited conditions on the development subject to the variance, as recommended
by the Zoning Board of Appeals, or as determined by the Council, that are
necessary or appropriate to reduce the impact or injurious effect of said
variance and to better carry out the general intent of the Village regulations.
Action by Council shall be by a majority vote of Council, except that any
proposed variance which fails to receive a positive recommendation from the
Board shall not be approved by Council except by a favorable vote of at least
two-thirds (2/3rds) of all the Commissioners. A denial shall not require an
ordinance, but shall be reflected in the official minutes of Council. Any
approval shall be memorialized in ordinance form.
   No variance in any case shall be approved by Council without a hearing by
the Board and a report to Council, as required in Sections
1264.06 and
1264.07, respectively.
(Ord. 1996-26. Passed 10-28-96; Ord. 2011-15. Passed 4-11-11; Ord. 2017-13.
Passed 4-24-17.)
1264.09 TIME LIMIT APPLICABLE TO VARIATIONS.
   (a)   No variation relative to the erection or alteration of a building or
structure shall be valid for longer than one year from the date of the approval
of the variation, unless a building permit for such erection or alteration is
obtained within such period and such erection or alteration is started and
proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms of such permit.
   (b)   No variation relative to the use of an existing building or premises
shall be valid for longer than one year from the date of the approval of the
variation, unless such use is established within such period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if such use is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a
building or structure, such variation shall continue in full force and effect
beyond said one-year period, provided that a building permit for such erection
or alteration is obtained within the initial one-year period, such erection or
alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with the terms
of such permit and such use is established within six months after the erection
or alteration work is completed.
   (c)   Without need to reappear before the Plan Commission or the Zoning
Board of Appeals, the owner of any property, in relation to which a variation
has been granted, may petition the Village Council for up to a six-month
extension of the time limitations set forth in subsection (a) and/or (b)
hereof, as extended if applicable, and, upon a showing of good cause as to why
said time limitation(s) could not be complied with, the Village Council may
grant said extension request. No more than two such extensions may be
petitioned for and granted in regard to a particular variation.
(Ord. 2001-09. Passed 2-26-01; Ord. 2004-49. Passed 9-13-04; Ord. 2005-27.
Passed 7-11-05.)
1264.10 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal for a variance shall stay all proceedings and furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Building Commissioner certifies to the Zoning
Board of Appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed with him or her, that
by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his or her
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, the
proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, with notice
to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and upon due cause being shown.

1268.01 PURPOSES.
   The Residential Districts set forth in this Zoning Code are established in
support of the primary goal of the Village which is stated in the Comprehensive
Plan as follows: "To maintain the existing character of the Village, especially
as to population density, the preservation of trees and other plant and animal
life, both wild and domestic, topography, natural contours and drainage."
   In further support of this goal and to protect the health, safety, welfare
and economic stability of the residents, the following specific objectives
shall be considered:
   (a)   Protection against fire, noxious fumes, excessive noise, dust and
other pollution of air, water and the soil;
   (b)   Protection and promotion of proper lighting and ventilation of
buildings;
   (c)   Protection of residential areas against unduly heavy traffic and
vehicles, hazardous thoroughfares and intersections and dangerous and improper
egress from and ingress to public streets; and
   (d)   Promotion of the best use and development of residential land in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan, thus protecting the value of land and
improvements and thereby strengthening the tax base.
1268.02 R-I-A ONE-FAMILY DWELLING DISTRICT.
   (a)   Permitted Uses. The following uses are permitted in the R-1-A One-
Family Dwelling District:

community residence; and
         B.   Has obtained a State of Illinois license or certification or the
sponsoring agency is licensed or certified by the State of Illinois to operate
community residences.
      (6)   Small wireless facilities, as defined and regulated in
Chapter 1032, when located entirely within a public right-of-way.
   (b)   Height of Buildings.
      (1)   The maximum height of a building in an R-1-A District shall be as
follows:
         A.   Twenty-five feet, and not over two and one-half stories, for a
one-family detached dwelling, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) hereof
      (2)   The height of a building having a hip, gable or gambrel roof may be
increased one foot for each additional five feet of setback provided from the
minimum required front yard setback, up to a maximum of thirty feet. The
twenty-five foot maximum shall remain in effect for all other architectural
types and styles of roofs.
      (3)   For purposes of determining whether an increase in building height,
as provided for in subsection (2) above, will be allowed, the additional
setback shall be calculated based on the following formula:
   The distance between the front      The
   property line and the frontmost      required
   (closest point to the front   -   front yard   =   Additional setback
   property line) edge of that      setback
   portion of the roof used to      distance
   determine the building height
      (4)   Provided that the frontmost (closest point to the front property
line) edge of that portion of the roof used to determine the building height is
located at a point at least fifty feet from the front lot line, if the lot on
which the building is located is at least one acre in size, and the abutting
residential lots are all at least one acre in size, the height limitations set
forth in subsections (1)A. and (2) above shall be increased as follows:
         A.   The twenty-five foot limitation set forth in subsections (1)A.
and (2) above shall be increased to thirty feet; and
         B.   The thirty foot limitation set forth in subsection (2) above
shall be increased to thirty-five feet.
   (c)   Lot Sizes.  Every one-family detached dwelling erected in an R-1-
A District after April 25, 1960, shall be on a lot having an area of not less

(exclusive of roadway easements and ingress/egress easements), but not
including abutting, platted, dedicated streets and alleys, and such lot shall
have a width at the established building set-back line of not less than 150
feet, except as provided in Section
1286.02.
   *For an existing developed lot in an R-1-A District of less than one acre,
where an improvement is proposed, the requirement of appearing before the
Zoning Board of Appeals for a variation to lot size will not be necessary.
   *For an existing developed lot in an R-1-A District of less than one acre,
where an improvement to an existing structure is proposed or where the Village
has issued a demolition permit to raze the existing structure, the owner will
be allowed to rebuild without the requirement of appearing before the Zoning
Board of Appeals for a variation of lot size.
   (d)   Yard Areas. No building in an R-1-A District shall be erected or
enlarged unless the following yards are provided and maintained in connection
with such building.
   (e)   Front Yards. Each lot upon which a dwelling is to be constructed shall
have a front yard of not less than fifty feet in depth from the building line
to the front lot line, except that:
      (1)   In a developed block where more than fifty percent of the existing
buildings have setbacks which exceed the fifty-foot minimum, the setback to be
required of new construction on such block shall be equal to the average
setback distance of all developed lots on the block, not to exceed 100 feet,
unless the owner of the lot on which the new construction is taking place
desires a front yard in excess of 100 feet.
      (2)   In a developed block where more than fifty percent of the existing
buildings have setbacks of less than fifty feet, the setback to be required of
new construction on such block shall be equal to the average setback distance
of all developed lots on the block.
   For purposes of this section, "average setback distance" shall be determined
by totalling the actual setback distances of all developed lots on the block in
question and dividing the sum total by the number of individual developed lots.

easement for ingress and egress.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, where
the side yard of a corner lot abuts a dedicated but unimproved right-of-way,
the side yard setback for the side yard abutting said dedicated but unimproved
right-of-way shall be controlled by the first sentence of this subsection.

or entity established for the purpose of benefiting the owners and residents of
the planned development or retained by the developer with legally binding
guarantees, in a form approved by the State's Attorney, that the common open
space will be permanently preserved as open area. All land conveyed to a not-
for-profit corporation or similar entity shall be subject to the right of such
corporation to impose a legally enforceable lien for maintenance and
improvement of the common open space.
   (c)   Public Facilities. No public facilities and improvements for the
planned unit development shall be constructed in advance of the approval of the

the use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned unit development
shall be recorded at the same time as the final planned unit development plat.
1270.04 CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   No work shall be started until the building permit is issued and a bond is
posted in accordance with the following: The petitioner or developer shall
construct and install the required improvements and must post with the Village
a sum, in cash, negotiable securities or a surety bond running to the Village,
in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost at the time of construction,
including engineering and inspection fees and costs, to assure the satisfactory
installation of such improvements. The amount of such deposit or bond shall be
based upon the confirmed estimate of cost hereinabove provided for. If a surety
bond is submitted, it shall have a good and sufficient surety thereon and shall

following: The petitioner or developer shall construct and install the required
improvements and must post with the Village a sum, in cash, negotiable
securities or a surety bond running to the Village, in an amount sufficient to
cover the full cost at the time of construction, including engineering and
inspection fees and costs, to assure the satisfactory installation of such
improvements. The amount of such deposit or bond shall be based upon the
confirmed estimate of cost hereinabove provided for. If a surety bond is
submitted, it shall have a good and sufficient surety thereon and shall not be
accepted until approved by Council. The above total performance requirement may
be waived at the discretion of Council, except that at no time may bond
requirements for Municipal improvements be waived. The Building Commissioner
and his or her inspectors shall have access to the development at all times
during the period of construction. Upon completion, inspection shall be made by
Council or its agent at the expense of the developer, and upon approval or

(Ord. 2021-18. Passed 6-28-21.)
1273.07 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW AND SITE DEVELOPMENT ALLOWANCES.
   (a)   Standards for Review. Modifications in conventional zoning and
subdivision regulations are privileges and will be considered by the Village
only in direct response to the accrual of tangible benefits from the WGA
Planned Unit Development to the Village or the Western Growth Area. These
benefits shall be in the form of exceptional amenities, outstanding
environmental, landscape, architectural or site design, or the conservation of
special man-made or natural features of the site. In reviewing an application
for a WGA Planned Unit Development, the Plan Commission and/or the Village
Council, as the case may be, shall be required to make certain findings based
on the following standards.
      (1)   Required findings. No application for a WGA Planned Unit
Development shall be approved unless all of the following findings are made
relative to the proposal:
         A.   Western Growth Area Master Plan and Design Guidelines. The WGA
Planned Unit Development shall conform with the general planning policies of
the Village as set forth in the Western Growth Area Master Plan and Western
Growth Area Design Guidelines.
         B.   Public welfare. The WGA Planned Unit Development shall be so
designed, located and proposed to be operated and maintained that it will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property and will not
substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public
health, safety and welfare.
         C.   Impact on other property. The WGA Planned Unit Development shall
not be injurious to the use or enjoyment of other property in the neighborhood
for the purposes permitted in the underlying zoning district, shall not impede
the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding properties
for uses permitted in the underlying zoning district, shall not be inconsistent
with the community character of the neighborhood, shall not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood and will be consistent with the goals,
objectives, and policies set forth in the Western Growth Area Master Plan and
Western Growth Area Design Guidelines, and shall not substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood, or be incompatible with other
property in the immediate vicinity.
         D.   Impact on public facilities and resources. The WGA Planned Unit
Development shall be so designed that adequate utilities, road access,
drainage, and other necessary facilities will be provided to serve it. The WGA
Planned Unit Development shall include such impact donations as may be
reasonably determined by the Village Council. These required impact donations
shall be calculated in reasonable proportion to impact of the WGA Planned Unit
Development on public facilities and infrastructure.
         E.   Archaeological, historical or cultural impact. The WGA Planned
Unit Development shall not substantially adversely affect a known
archaeological, historical, or cultural resource located on or off of the
parcel proposed for development.
         F.   Conservation. The WGA Planned Unit Development shall preserve and
protect sensitive environmental features of the site including but not limited
to stands of mature and healthy trees, wetlands, floodplains, and steep slopes.
         G.   Parking and traffic. The WGA Planned Unit Development shall have
or make adequate provision to provide ingress and egress to and from the
proposed use in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion in the public
streets and provides adequate access for emergency vehicles.
         H.   Adequate buffering. The WGA Planned Unit Development shall have
adequate landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to
protect uses within the development and surrounding properties.
         I.   Performance. The applicant shall demonstrate a successful history
of having completed one or more recent projects of comparable value and
complexity in order to provide the Village with reasonable assurance that, if
authorized, the WGA Planned Unit Development can be completed according to
schedule as designed.
         J.   Appearance. The design of all buildings, structures, and
facilities on the site of the WGA Planned Unit Development shall generally meet
the design and development guidelines set forth in the Western Growth Area
Design Guidelines.
      (2)   Modification standards. In addition to the findings required above,
the following standards shall be utilized in considering applications for
modifications of the conventional zoning and subdivision regulations for a WGA
Planned Unit Development. These standards shall not be regarded as inflexible,
but shall be used as a framework by the Village to test the quality of the
amenities, benefits to the community, and design and desirability of the
proposal.
         A.   Integrated design. A WGA Planned Unit Development shall be laid
out and developed as a unit in accordance with an integrated overall design.
This design shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious
grouping of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of
space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features.
         B.   Beneficial common open space. Any common open space in the WGA
Planned Unit Development shall be integrated into the overall design. Such
spaces shall have a direct functional or visual relationship to the main
building(s) and not be of isolated or leftover character. The following shall
not be considered usable common open space:
            1.   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an
individual tenant or owner;
            2.   Dedicated streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way;
            3.   Vehicular drives, parking, loading and storage area; and
            4.   Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land less than fifteen
feet in width.
         C.   Location of higher buildings. Higher buildings shall be located
within the WGA Planned Unit Development in such a way as to dissipate any
material adverse impact on adjoining lower buildings within the development or
on surrounding properties and shall not unreasonably invade the privacy of
occupants of such lower buildings.
         D.   Functional and mechanical features. Exposed storage areas, trash
and garbage containers, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck
loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas
and structures shall be accounted for in the design of the WGA Planned Unit
Development and made as unobtrusive as possible. They shall be subject to such
setbacks, special landscaping or other screening methods as shall reasonably be
required to prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated
environment and the surrounding properties.
         E.   Visual and acoustical privacy. The WGA Planned Unit Development
shall provide reasonable visual, and acoustical privacy for each commercial
unit. Fences, insulations, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used as
appropriate for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the
privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable view or uses, and
reduction of noises.
         F.   Energy efficient design. A WGA Planned Unit Development shall be
designed with consideration given to various methods of site design and
building location, architectural design of individual structures, and
landscaping design capable of reducing energy consumption within the WGA
Planned Unit Development and, to the extent feasible, the applicant will be
encouraged to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certification for the project.
         G.   Landscape conservation and visual enhancement. The existing
landscape and trees in a WGA Planned Unit Development shall be conserved and
enhanced, insofar as feasible, by minimizing tree and soil removal, and the
conservation of special landscape features such as streams, ponds, groves and
land forms. The addition or use of larger trees, shrubs, flowers, fountains,
ponds and special paving amenities is encouraged to the extent of their
appropriateness and usefulness to the WGA Planned Unit Development and the
likelihood of their continued maintenance.
         H.   Drives, parking and circulation. Principal vehicular access shall
be from dedicated public streets, and access points shall be designed to
encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum
hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking,
special attention shall be given to the location and number of access points to
the public streets, the width of interior drives and access points, the general
interior circulation, the separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, the
adequate provision for service by emergency vehicles, and the arrangement of
parking areas that are safe and convenient, and, insofar as feasible, do not
detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the
neighboring properties.
         I.   Surface water drainage. Special attention shall be given to
proper site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not
adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system.
Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it
will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      (3)   Site development allowances. Notwithstanding any limitations on
variations which can be approved as contained elsewhere in this Code, site
development allowances (i.e., deviations or variations from the underlying
zoning provisions set forth outside this section) may be approved provided the
applicant specifically identifies each such site development allowance and
demonstrates how each such site development allowance would be compatible with
surrounding development, is in furtherance of the stated objectives of this
section and is necessary for proper development of the site.
(Ord. 2021-18. Passed 6-28-21.)
1273.08 CHANGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT.
   The development project shall be developed only according to the approved
and recorded final plat and all supporting data. The recorded final plat and
supporting data, together with all recorded amendments, shall be binding on the
applicants, their successors, grantees and assigns and shall limit and control
the use of premises and the location of structures in the planned unit
development project as set forth therein.
   (a)   Major Changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the
planned unit development, including increases in density, increases in the
height of the buildings, reductions of proposed open spaces, changes in the
development schedule, changes in road standards or changes in the final
governing agreements, provisions or covenants, or other changes, may be
approved only by submission of a new final planned unit development plat and by

1274.04 LIMITATION ON NON-RETAIL/NON-RESTAURANT USES. (EXPIRED)
   Editor’s Note: The prior requirements contained in this section imposed by
Ordinance 2004-29, passed 5-24-04, expired on June 1, 2006.
1274.05 COMMERCIAL PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Intent and Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of the regulations, standards, and criteria contained
in this section is to provide an alternate zoning procedure under which land
can be developed or redeveloped with innovation, imagination, and creative
architectural design when sufficiently justified under the provisions of this
section. The objective of the commercial planned development is to encourage a
higher level of design and amenity than is possible to achieve under otherwise
applicable zoning regulations. The end result can be a product which fulfills
the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, Commercial Areas Master Plan, and
planning policies of the Village, while departing from the strict application
of the use and bulk regulations of the underlying zoning regulations. The
commercial planned development is intended to permit and encourage such
flexibility and to accomplish the following purposes:
         A.   To stimulate creative approaches to the commercial and
commercial/mixed-use development of land.
         B.   To provide more efficient use of land.
         C.   To preserve natural features and provide open space areas and
recreation areas in excess of that required under existing zoning regulations.
         D.   To develop new approaches to the living environment through
variety in type, design and layout of buildings, transportation systems, and
public facilities.
         E.   To unify building and structures through design.
         F.   Promotion of long term planning pursuant to the Commercial Areas
Master Plan and Comprehensive Plan, which will allow harmonious and compatible
land uses or combinations of uses with surrounding areas.
      (2)   The development of Village owned buildings and property shall be
exempt from the requirements of this section.
   (b)   General Provisions.
      (1)   No commercial development on a lot with an area of 5,000 square
feet or greater, or a proposed commercial building(s) with 5,000 square feet of
floor area or greater, shall be permitted unless approved as a commercial
planned development in accordance with this section.
      (2)   Commercial planned developments along Southwest Highway shall have
a minimum frontage of 300 lineal feet along Southwest Highway and must
accommodate the coordinated future development of adjacent parcels.
      (3)   Each commercial planned development should be presented and judged
on its own merits. It shall not be sufficient to base justification for
approval of a commercial planned development upon an already existing
commercial planned development except to the extent such commercial planned
development has been approved as part of a commercial development master plan.
      (4)   The burden of providing evidence and persuasion that any commercial
planned development is necessary and desirable shall in every case rest with
the applicant.
      (5)   Buildings and uses or combinations of uses within a commercial
planned development shall be limited solely to those approved as part of the
ordinance granting a commercial planned development permit; provided, however,
that any buildings and uses or combinations of uses in compliance with a
commercial development master plan approved as part of the ordinance granting a
commercial planned development permit may be approved by the Village Council.
   (c)   Standards for Review. Modifications in conventional zoning and
subdivision regulations are privileges and will be considered by the Village
only in direct response to the accrual of tangible benefits from the commercial
planned development to the Village or the neighborhood in which it would be
located. These benefits shall be in the form of exceptional amenities,
outstanding environmental, landscape, architectural or site design, or the
conservation of special man-made or natural features of the site. In reviewing
an application for a commercial planned development, the Plan Commission and/or
the Village Council, as the case may be, shall be required to make certain
findings based on the following standards.
      (1)   Required findings. No application for a commercial planned
development shall be approved unless all of the following findings are made
relative to the proposal:
         A.   Comprehensive Plan and Commercial Areas Master Plan. The
commercial planned development shall conform with the general planning policies
of the Village as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and Commercial Areas
Master Plan.
         B.   Public welfare. The commercial planned development shall be so
designed, located and proposed to be operated and maintained that it will not
impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property and will not
substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public
health, safety and welfare.
         C.   Impact on other property. The commercial planned development
shall not be injurious to the use or enjoyment of other property in the
neighborhood for the purposes permitted in the underlying zoning district,
shall not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of
surrounding properties for uses permitted in the underlying zoning district,
shall not be inconsistent with the community character of the neighborhood,
shall not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will be
consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan and Commercial Areas Master Plan, and shall not
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood, or be
incompatible with other property in the immediate vicinity.
         D.   Impact on public facilities and resources. The commercial planned
development shall be so designed that adequate utilities, road access,
drainage, and other necessary facilities will be provided to serve it. The
commercial planned development shall include such impact donations as may be
reasonably determined by the Village Council. These required impact donations
shall be calculated in reasonable proportion to impact of the commercial
planned development on public facilities and infrastructure.
         E.   Archaeological, historical or cultural impact. The commercial
planned development shall not substantially adversely affect a known
archaeological, historical, or cultural resource located on or off of the
parcel proposed for development.
         F.   Parking and traffic. The commercial planned development shall
have or make adequate provision to provide ingress and egress to and from the
proposed use in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion in the public
streets and provides adequate access for emergency vehicles.
         G.   Adequate buffering. The commercial planned development shall have
adequate landscaping, public open space, and other buffering features to
protect uses within the development and surrounding properties.
         H.   Performance. The applicant shall demonstrate a successful history
of having completed one or more recent projects of comparable value and
complexity in order to provide the Village with reasonable assurance that, if
authorized, the commercial planned development can be completed according to
schedule as designed.
         I.   Appearance. The design of all buildings, structures and
facilities on the site of the commercial planned development shall generally
meet the design and development guidelines set forth in the Commercial Areas
Master Plan.
         J.   Signage. Any signage on the site of the commercial planned
development shall be in conformity with
Chapter 1480 of this Code, or shall satisfy the standards for variation thereof
as provided for in this Code.
      (2)   Modification standards. In addition to the findings required above,
the following standards shall be utilized in considering applications for
modifications of the conventional zoning and subdivision regulations for a
commercial planned development. These standards shall not be regarded as
inflexible, but shall be used as a framework by the Village to test the quality
of the amenities, benefits to the community, and design and desirability of the
proposal.
         A.   Integrated design. A commercial planned development shall be laid
out and developed as a unit in accordance with an integrated overall design.
This design shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious
grouping of structures, uses and facilities, and for appropriate relation of
space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features.
         B.   Beneficial common open space. Any common open space in the
commercial planned development shall be integrated into the overall design.
Such spaces shall have a direct functional or visual relationship to the main
building(s) and not be of isolated or leftover character. The following shall
not be considered usable common open space:
            1.   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an
individual tenant or owner;
            2.   Dedicated streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way;
            3.   Vehicular drives, parking, loading and storage area; and
            4.   Irregular or unusable narrow strips of land less than fifteen
feet in width.
         C.   Location of higher buildings. Higher buildings shall be located
within the commercial planned development in such a way as to dissipate any
material adverse impact on adjoining lower buildings within the development or
on surrounding properties, and shall not unreasonably invade the privacy of
occupants of such lower buildings.
         D.   Functional and mechanical features. Exposed storage areas, trash
and garbage containers, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck
loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas
and structures shall be accounted for in the design of the commercial planned
development and made as unobtrusive as possible. They shall be subject to such
setbacks, special landscaping or other screening methods as shall reasonably be
required to prevent their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated
environment and the surrounding properties.
         E.   Visual and acoustical privacy. The commercial planned development
shall provide reasonable visual, and acoustical privacy for each commercial
unit. Fences, insulations, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used as
appropriate for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the
privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable view or uses, and
reduction of noises.
         F.   Energy efficient design. A commercial planned development shall
be designed with consideration given to various methods of site design and
building location, architectural design of individual structures, and
landscaping design capable of reducing energy consumption within the commercial
planned development and, to the extent feasible, the applicant will be
encouraged to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
certification for the project.
         G.   Landscape conservation and visual enhancement. The existing
landscape and trees in a commercial planned development shall be conserved and
enhanced, insofar as feasible, by minimizing tree and soil removal, and the
conservation of special landscape features such as streams, ponds, groves and
land forms. The addition or use of larger trees, shrubs, flowers, fountains,
ponds and special paving amenities is encouraged to the extent of their
appropriateness and usefulness to the commercial planned development and the
likelihood of their continued maintenance.
         H.   Drives, parking and circulation. Principal vehicular access shall
be from dedicated public streets, and access points shall be designed to
encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum
hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. With respect to vehicular and
pedestrian circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking,
special attention shall be given to the location and number of access points to
the public streets, the width of interior drives and access points, the general
interior circulation, the separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, the
adequate provision for service by emergency vehicles, and the arrangement of
parking areas that are safe and convenient, and, insofar as feasible, do not
detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures and the
neighboring properties.
         I.   Surface water drainage. Special attention shall be given to
proper site surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not
adversely affect neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system.
Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it
will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
   (d)   Site Development Allowances. Notwithstanding any limitations on
variations which can be approved as contained elsewhere in this Code, site
development allowances (i.e., deviations or variations from the underlying
zoning provisions set forth outside this section) may be approved provided the
applicant specifically identifies each such site development allowance and
demonstrates how each such site development allowance would be compatible with
surrounding development, is in furtherance of the stated objectives of this
section and is necessary for proper development of the site.
   (e)   Procedures. The following steps are provided to assure the orderly
review of every commercial planned development application in a timely and
equitable manner:
      (1)   Pre-filing review and transmittal of application.
         A.   Conference:

1276.01 PURPOSE.
   The Manufacturing District set forth herein is established to protect public
health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare and to protect the
economic base of the Village as well as the value of real estate by regulating
manufacturing development in appropriate locations. These general objectives
include, among others, the following specific objectives:
   (a)   To protect established residential areas, and the health of families
living therein, by restricting those nearby manufacturing activities which may
create offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, glare, fire
hazards and other objectionable influences to those areas which are appropriate
therefor;
   (b)   To provide space for manufacturing activities in locations accessible
to railways, waterways and highways, so that the movement of raw materials,
finished products and employees can be carried on efficiently and with a
minimum of danger to public life and property;
   (c)   To establish proper standards of performance which will restrict
obnoxious manufacturing activities, while at the same time encourage and permit
the manufacturing activities which have adopted facilities for the processing
of finished products without adversely affecting the health, happiness, safety,
convenience and welfare of the people living and working in nearby areas;
   (d)   To protect manufacturing districts from incompatible uses of land by
prohibiting the use of such space for new residential development, thereby
preserving the land for a more appropriate use in accordance with the plans for
Village improvement and development;
   (e)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well
considered plan of land use for all of the Village, to conserve the use of
property, to promote stability of manufacturing activities and related
development, to protect the character and established development in each area
of the community, to enhance and stabilize the value of land and to protect the
tax base of the Village.

1282.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to alleviate or prevent congestion of the
public streets and promote the safety and welfare of the public by establishing
minimum requirements for the off-street parking, loading and unloading of motor
vehicles.
1282.02 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Application for Building Permits.  An application for a building
permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use shall include therewith
a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any parking or
loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Application of Requirements.  Off-street parking and loading
requirements of this chapter apply as follows:
      (1)   All buildings and structures erected or enlarged and land uses
initiated after the effective date of this Zoning Code shall provide accessory
off-street parking or loading facilities as required by this chapter for the
use thereof.
      (2)   When a building or structure erected or enlarged prior to or after
the effective date of this Zoning Code undergoes a decrease in the number of
dwelling units, the gross floor area, the seating capacity, the number of
employees or another unit of measurement specified in this chapter for required
parking or loading facilities, and when such decreases would result in a
requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces through application of
this chapter, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly.
However, existing parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when
the facilities remaining will at least equal or exceed the parking or loading
requirements resulting from application of this Zoning Code to the entire
building or structure as modified.
      (3)   When a building or structure undergoes an increase in the number of
dwelling units, the gross floor area, the seating capacity or another unit of
measurement specified in this chapter for required parking or loading
facilities, and when such increase would result in a requirement for additional
total parking or loading spaces through application of this Zoning Code,
parking and loading facilities may be increased accordingly. However, existing
parking or loading facilities shall be increased so that the facilities will at
least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements resulting from
application of this Zoning Code to the entire building or structure as
modified.
   (c)   Existing Parking and Loading Spaces. Accessory off-street parking and
loading spaces in existence on the effective date of this Zoning Code may not
be reduced in number unless they already exceed the requirements of this
chapter for equivalent new construction. In this event, the spaces shall not be
reduced below the number required by this chapter for such equivalent new
construction.
   (d)   Service of Existing Uses of Land or Buildings. Nothing in this chapter
shall prevent the establishment of off-street automobile parking or loading
facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, subject to full
compliance with this chapter, except that off-street parking areas accessory to
existing multifamily structures cannot be located off the premises containing
the principal use, unless on a lot adjacent thereto, without special
authorization from Council.
   (e)   Damage or Destruction of Buildings and Uses. A building, structure or
use which is in existence and is a conforming use on the effective date of this
Zoning Code and which is subsequently damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse,
explosion or other cause, may be reconstructed, re-established or repaired,
with or without off-street parking or loading facilities, except that parking
or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage
or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, it is not
necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of
those required by this Zoning Code for equivalent new construction.
1282.03 REQUIRED SPACES GENERALLY; USES NOT SPECIFIED.
   Requirements governing the number and location of off-street parking and
loading facilities in relation to the use of property are established in this
chapter. The parking and loading requirements for any use not specified in this
chapter shall be the same as for a similar specified use, as determined by
Section
1282.13.
1282.04 FLOOR AREA DEFINED.
   Floor area, as employed in this chapter in the case of office, merchandising
or service types of uses, means the gross floor area of a building or
structures used or intended to be used for service to the public as customers,
patrons, clients, patients or tenants, including areas occupied by fixtures and
equipment used for display or sale of merchandise. “Floor area,” for the
purposes of this chapter, does not include any area used for:
   (a)   Stairs/stairwells;
   (b)   Elevator shafts; or
   (c)   Elevator equipment rooms.
(Ord. 2005-40. Passed 11-28-05.)
1282.05 USE OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking facilities accessory to a residential use and developed
in a Residential District in accordance with this chapter shall be used solely
for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling
structures to which such facilities are accessory, or by guests of such
occupants. Under no circumstances shall required parking facilities accessory
to residential structures be used for the storage of commercial vehicles, or
for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants,
visitors or customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
(Ord. 2016-14. Passed 3-28-16.)
1282.06 JOINT PARKING FACILITIES.
   Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses or
for mixed uses may be provided collectively in any zoning district in which
separate parking facilities for each constituent use is permitted. However, the
total number of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of
the separate requirements for each use.
1282.07 LOCATION OF ACCESSORY FACILITIES.
   When required accessory off-street parking facilities are provided elsewhere
than on the lot on which the principal use served is located, they shall be in
the same possession, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property
occupied by such principal use. The owner of such property shall be bound by
covenants filed of record in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Cook County
requiring the owner and his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the required
number of parking spaces during the existence of such principal use.
1282.08 PERMITTED DISTRICTS FOR ACCESSORY FACILITIES.
   Accessory parking facilities provided elsewhere than on the same zoning lot
with the principal use served in accordance with Section
1282.13, may be located in any zoning district except as follows:
   (a)   No parking facilities accessory to a multifamily use shall be located
in an R-1-A District.
   (b)   No parking facilities accessory to a business or manufacturing use
shall be located in a Residential District.
   (c)   No parking facilities accessory to a manufacturing use shall be
permitted in a B-1 District.
(Ord. 2005-27. Passed 7-11-05; Ord. 2016-14. Passed 3-28-16.)
1282.09 DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE OF PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   Description of Space. A required off-street parking space shall be an
area of not less than 162 square feet, nor less than eight and one-half feet
wide by nineteen feet long, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps,
columns or office and work areas, shall be accessible from streets or alleys or
from private driveways or aisles leading to streets or alleys, and shall be
used for the storage or parking of passenger automobiles and commercial
vehicles under one and one-half tons capacity where permitted under this Zoning
Code. Aisles between vehicular parking spaces shall not be less than twelve
feet in width when serving automobiles parked at a forty-five degree angle in
one direction, or less than twenty feet in width when serving automobiles
parked perpendicular to the aisles and accommodating two-way traffic.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided the area of a required off- street
parking space is at least one hundred sixty-two (162) square feet, the length
of the parking space may be reduced to eighteen (18) feet.
   (b)   Measurement of Space. When determination of the number of required
off-street parking spaces results in a requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded, and fractions over
one-half shall be interpreted as one parking space.
   (c)   Open and Enclosed Spaces. Parking areas may be open or enclosed except
that when parking facilities accessory to a multiple dwelling are located in a
Residential or B-1 or B-2 District elsewhere than on the same zoning lot with
the principal use served, such parking facilities shall be open to the sky.
   (d)   Access. Parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of
vehicular access to a street or alley in such a manner as will least interfere
with the movement of traffic. No driveway or curb cut in any district shall
exceed twenty-five feet in width.
   (e)   Required Setbacks.  No parking space or portion thereof, established
on a zoning lot without a building, shall be located closer to a street line
that the established building line on adjacent properties, or closer than the
front yard setback required for the district in which the parking lot is
located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where said parking lot is being used in
conjunction with a parking lot on adjacent property on which a building is
located, the parking spaces may be located as close to the street line as are
the parking spaces on the adjacent lot with the building on it. Further, a
wall, fence or hedge developed around a parking area shall be subject to the
front yard setback requirements of Part Twelve, Title Six in the same manner as
a building or structure. Any open off- street parking area for other than a
residential use, which parking area adjoins a Residential District, shall be
set back a minimum of fifteen feet from the property line adjacent to the
Residential District.
   (f)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, except those accessory
to single-family dwellings, shall be improved with a compacted macadam base,
not less than four inches thick, surfaced with asphaltic concrete or
constructed to some comparable specification, at the discretion of the Plan
Commission. An improvement of crushed stone may be recommended.
   (g)   Screening and Landscaping.  All open off-street parking areas for six
or more cars shall be effectively screened by a berm, planting or combination
of both, consisting of a densely planted compact hedge of coniferous trees,
along any side that adjoins or is directly across a street or alley from
property in a Residential District. Such berm or planting shall be at least
four feet high and shall be maintained in good condition.
   (h)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate an off-street parking area
shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 1476 of this Code of Ordinances.

1282.10 LOCATION OF PARKING AREAS.
   Off-street automobile parking facilities shall be located as specified in
this section. Where a distance is specified, such distance shall be walking
distance measured from the nearest point of the parking area to the nearest
entrance of the building that the parking area is required to serve.
   (a)   For one and two-family dwellings, off-street parking areas shall be
located on the same lot with the building they are required to serve.
   (b)   For three and four-family dwellings, not over two stories in height,
off-street parking areas shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land as
the building they are required to serve. For the purpose of this subsection, a
group of such uses constructed and maintained under single ownership or
management shall be assumed to be on a single lot or parcel of land.
   (c)   For multi-family residential uses, containing four or more dwelling
units, off-street parking areas shall be located on the same lot or parcel of
land as the building they are required to serve, or on a separate lot or parcel
of land not more than 300 feet from the nearest entrance to the principal
building being served, provided that the lot or parcel of land selected for the
parking facilities is located in an multi-family residential district or a less
restricted district.
   (d)   For rooming houses, lodging houses, clubs, hospitals, sanitariums,
orphanages, homes for the aged, convalescent homes, dormitories, sorority and
fraternity houses and for other similar uses, off-street parking areas shall be
located on the same lot or parcel of land as the principal building being
served, or on property contiguous to the zoning lot on which is located the
building they are intended to serve, provided, however, said off-street parking
shall not be located in an R-1-A One-Family Dwelling District.
   (e)   For uses other than those specified above, off-street parking
facilities shall be provided on the same lot or parcel of land as the principal
building being served.

twelve months after the date of issuance, shall expire, and no work under the
permit shall commence thereafter. Said expired permit, however, may be renewed
as set forth below, provided the proposed work is still in conformance with the
Village Code and provided the owner and contractor estimate and the Village
agrees that the work can be completed within the renewal period. Said permits
for construction of new buildings where all work on exterior walls and roof is
completed and inspected by the Village may be renewed in increments of three
months with commencement and completion of the work to take place within the
renewal period. All other permits may be renewed in increments of six months
with commencement and completion of the work to take place within the renewal
period. Fees for said permit renewals shall include a plan review fee if needed
to determine compliance with Village Code, as well as the other fees as
required in this chapter, with said fees being prorated based on the length of

landfill or landcut, shall, in addition to the payment of all other applicable
fees required by this Code, deposit with the Village Clerk either cash or a
letter of credit in the amount of three thousand five hundred dollars
($3,500.00) to cover the cost of repair of damage to street foundations or
surfaces, sidewalks, sewers, conduits, culverts, ditches or other Village
property or utilities that may result, directly or indirectly, from such
construction, addition or alteration. Each building or structure so constructed
or added to, and each landfill or landcut so constructed, added to or altered,
shall require a separate deposit.
(Adopting Ordinance; Ord. 2001-19. Passed 5-14-01.)
   (b)   Upon completion of the work authorized by such permit, the
Commissioner of Streets and Public Improvements shall determine the amount of
damage, if any, which has resulted, directly or indirectly, from the work
completed pursuant to such permit. If it is determined that damage has
resulted, then the cost of restoring the street foundation or surface,
sidewalk, sewer, conduit, culvert, ditch or other Village property or utility,
to a condition equal to that which existed before the issuance of the permit,
shall be deducted from the amount deposited with the Clerk and shall thereupon
be paid into the Village Treasury. The balance of the deposit, if any, shall be
refunded to the applicant. If it is determined that no damage has resulted, the
full amount of the deposit shall be refunded to the applicant.
   (c)   If the amount of such deposit is not sufficient to pay the costs of
restoration, or if evidence of latent damage to sewers, conduits, culverts or
underground utilities is found within one year of the work, then the amount of
such deficiency or damage shall be certified by the Commissioner of Streets and
Public Improvements to the Village Treasurer, who shall collect the same from
the applicant.
(Ord. 1953-4. Passed 10-12-53.)
1444.12 REVIEW OF PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   The Commissioner of Public Property and Building, when reviewing
applications for building permits, shall determine whether or not the proposed
construction is consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and is in
conformity with the applicable flood prevention statutes of the State and
ordinances of the Village. The Commissioner shall also determine whether or not
the property owner has complied with all zoning regulations of the Village and
all applicable building ordinances.
1444.13 USE OR OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   All use and occupancy permits shall be issued by the Commissioner of Public
Property and Building or his or her designated representative upon proper
inspection and determination that all standards have been met.
   If a structure is occupied, or if heating plant, sewage facility, etc., is
used, prior to issuance of a use or occupancy permit by the Village, there
shall be assessed against the party to whom the building permit is issued a
penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day for each day that such

(Ord. 1993-37. Passed 9-13-93; Ord. 2011-02. Passed 1-10-11.)
1460.02 TREE CONSERVATION ON CONSTRUCTION SITES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish regulations that
respect the rights of property owners while prohibiting the clear cutting of
trees before construction, conserving existing trees, limiting the unnecessary
removal of trees, and ensuring the replacement of trees on sites where
construction is proposed; thereby sustaining the unique pastoral setting and
rural splendor of the Village and its ecological, physical, historical, and
aesthetic natural environment.
   (b)   Goals.
      (1)   Conserve trees because they are an important natural public
resource which enhances the quality of life and general health, safety, and
welfare of the entire community.
      (2)   Conserve the essential character of those areas throughout the
Village that are heavily wooded, and in a more natural state, with plant
material indigenous to the region.

sedimentation.
      (4)   Reduce storm water run-off, and the costs associated therewith, and
replenish the ground water supplies.
      (5)   Protect the important link in the hydrological cycle that trees
provide through the transpiration of water and neutralization of wastes that
pass through to the groundwater table and other aquifers.
      (6)   Reduce air pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide, generating
oxygen, and trapping dust and other airborne pollutants.
      (7)   Reduce noise and light pollution within the Village through the
baffle and barrier effect of trees.
      (8)   Prevent and restore, to the greatest extent possible, the denuded
soil around trees that would otherwise result from construction and grading
work accompanying development.
      (9)   Reduce energy consumption by shading buildings in the summer and
blocking wind in the winter.
      (10)   Eliminate trees that constitute a threat, danger, or nuisance to
the public or to property in the Village, or that may be dangerous to the
health of other trees, vegetation, and/or wildlife.
      (11)   Provide a haven and nesting areas for birds, insects, and other
forms of wildlife that are essential to the food chain and that help control
and eliminate disease-carrying mosquitoes.

construction, regrading, demolition, subdivision, and other changes to private
property.
      (4)   Limit the unnecessary and premature clearing of trees from a
proposed private development site.
      (5)   Protect trees from damage during construction and provide a
nurturing environment for healthy trees.
      (6)   Encourage the replacement of trees so there is no net loss of tree
cover due to construction, and a long range increase of tree cover in the
community.
      (7)   Integrate the requirements for tree conservation on construction
sites with the Tree City Program and other programs, regulations, and
guidelines of the Village.
   (d)   Definitions.

reverse, or modify the decision, depending on whether the Village  Manager
finds there is an inconsistent administration of Village requirements, or there
is a unique situation on the site that causes an extreme hardship or detriment
if the Village requirements are followed, provided the purpose, goals,
objectives, and intent of the Village Code can still be achieved.
   (f)   Tree Plan.
      (1)   Contents. The tree plan shall include all the data and information
needed to determine compliance with this section. Typically, the tree plan
shall be shown on the same drawing along with the grading plan, soil erosion
control plan, and construction conduct plan; however, the tree plan may be
shown on a separate drawing, if need be, for graphic legibility. For sites over
two acres, or where ten or more trees are proposed to be removed, the tree plan
must be prepared by a certified arborist.
         (See
Appendix 1460-C for a Typical Tree Plan.)
         The tree plan shall include the following.
         A.   An accurate plat of survey showing the location of:
            1.   Existing trees on the construction site;
            2.   Existing trees on the parkway adjacent to the construction
site;
            3.   Existing trees on neighboring lots that have their critical
root zone partially on the construction site;
            4.   Existing trees to be removed; and
            5.   New trees to be planted.
      (See Village Code Section
1248.03: Street Trees;
Chapter 1461: Commercial Trees and Landscaping;
Chapters 1270 and
1274 Planned Unit Developments;
Chapter 1286 Screening;
Chapter 1028 Village-Owned Property.)
         B.   Data on species, size, critical root zones, and health condition
of existing and proposed trees.
         C.   Specifications and notes on the protection methods and treatment
methods, if any.
         D.   Calculation of the tree bank fee, if any.
         E.   Additional information as may be requested by the Village, as
needed, for sites with special circumstances, in order to show special
solutions or otherwise comply with the purpose and intent of this section. The
Building Department, Village Arborist, or an advising certified arborist will
assist in identifying such information, if needed.
      (2)   Design Criteria. The following criteria shall be used to prepare
the tree plan and to review, modify, and approve tree permits:
         A.   Tree health. Trees in good health that are expected to survive to
maturity without treatment are to be saved if possible, except for removed
trees. Trees in moderate health that are expected to survive to maturity with
appropriate treatment are to be treated, except for removed trees. Appropriate
treatment methods are to be recommended by the Village Arborist or a certified
arborist and approved by the Building Department.
            (See
Appendix 1460-D for Tree Health Ratings.)
         B.   Construction Plan adjustment. Design plans for regrading,
demolition, construction, and landscaping shall be adjusted, if feasible, to
save as many trees as possible.
         C.   Removed trees. Certain trees must be removed prior to
construction as specified on the tree permit, including:
            1.   Trees in an approved disturbance area, which is defined as the
area for construction of permanent improvements and necessary temporary access
to the construction.
         (See Section
1460.01 and
Appendix 1460-A for Disturbance Area.)
            2.   Trees in poor health.
               (See
Appendix 1460-D for Tree Health Ratings.)
            3.   Nuisance trees.
               (See Village Code Section
1028.06.)
            4.   Trees that are crowding a specimen tree, including trees that
are so close that they are detracting from the health of the specimen tree as
determined by a certified arborist.
               (See
Appendix 1460-F for Specimen Trees.)
            5.   Other trees approved for removal by the Building Department.
         D.   Replacement trees. Removed trees in an approved disturbance area
with a diameter at breast height of three inches or less for a deciduous tree
or six feet in height or less for a conifer tree are not required to be
replaced. Other removed trees shall be replaced and conform with the following:
            1.   Species of replacement trees shall be compatible with common
or native species. A diversity of species is encouraged. Prohibited species are
not to be selected.
               (See
Appendix 1460-E for Prohibited Trees.)
            2.   Each replacement tree shall have a minimum diameter at breast
height, at the time of planting, of two inches for oak, hickory, and ginkgo
trees, two and one half inches for other deciduous trees, and be a minimum of
four feet tall for conifer trees. Larger sizes are encouraged.
            3.   The replacement trees shall have a cumulative diameter at
breast height for deciduous trees and the cumulative height of conifer trees
the same as, or greater than, that of the removed trees.
         (For example: three Hickory trees are to be removed for a home
expansion in the rear yard, with the trees having diameter at breast height of
ten, twelve, and fourteen inches, which is a cumulative diameter at breast
height of thirty-six inches. The tree plan shows the trees the owner will plant
in the remaining space available on the lot. There is room for six new trees
and the owner proposes to plant three Linden and three Sycamore trees in the
side yards, each with a diameter at breast height of three inches. These six
replacement trees have a cumulative diameter at breast height of eighteen
inches. The tree plan shows a calculation for the remaining replacement trees
that would otherwise be required, which would be eighteen inches of cumulative
diameter at breast height and their cost equivalent. This is the tree bank fee
as referenced below.)
            3.   Tree planting locations for replacement trees shall be
selected to achieve the benefits of shade, buffering, stabilization, and the
other goals of this section. (If locations in the Village parkway are desired,
then compliance with the requirements of
Chapter 1028 will be required.) Locations with no obstructions to root growth
in the critical root zones are encouraged. Locations within ten feet of
underground utilities, fire hydrants, utility poles, drainage swales, or other
trees are prohibited.
            4.   Replacement trees that are planted that have fifty percent
(50%) or more deadwood within one year of planting, shall be replaced.
         E.   Protection methods. The tree plan shall include various
protection methods appropriate to the existing conditions and proposed tree
plan, as set forth below:
            1.   Protection fence. The tree protection fence is intended to
keep away activities that would be hazardous to the health of the tree, such as
driving over the roots or otherwise compacting soil, breaking branches,
scraping bark, dumping toxic materials or allowing them to flow into the
critical root zones, nailing to the trunk, trenching, cutting roots, burning,
and spraying that would be toxic to the tree. All trees to be saved shall be
protected by a fence, wall, or an alternative method approved by the Building
Department. Said fence shall be six feet high chain link with posts driven into
the ground at least three feet deep and placed eight to ten feet apart or an
alternative approved by the Building Department.
            Typically, the tree protection fence will be around the critical
root zones. The critical root zones, as measured from the trunk of deciduous
trees, for large trees is forty feet, for medium trees is thirty feet, for
small trees is twenty feet, and for conifer trees is ten feet. The required
disturbance area fence may suffice for part or the entire required tree
protection fence. The tree protection fence may be placed to cover up to ten
percent (10%) of the critical root zones if it would otherwise unavoidably
block construction access. Alternative fence locations may be recommended by a
certified arborist and approved by the Building Department.
            The tree protection fence shall be installed before construction
starts and shall be removed after construction is complete following approval
by the Village inspector.
         (See Section
1460.01 for disturbance area fence;
Appendix 1460-A for Typical Construction Conduct Plan;
Appendix 1460-C for Typical Tree Plan; and
Appendix 1460-F for Large, Medium and Small Trees.)
            2.   Warning signs. Signs are required to be posted by the property
owner or contractor that read 'HELP PROTECT THESE TREES - STAY OUT OF FENCED
AREA' or alternative approved by the Building Department. The size, lettering,
and location of signs shall be determined by the Building Department.
            3.   Tree wells. Grading plans shall be designed to maintain the
existing drainage and grade of the critical root zones around the trees to be
protected wherever feasible. Where a change of grade is necessary, then a tree
well or retaining wall around the critical root zones shall be required.
            4.   Auguring. The new installation of underground utilities using
the auguring method to minimize disturbance to the roots of a tree to be saved
shall be required if the Building Department determines, with the advice of an
arborist, that auguring is necessary to save the tree from failure.
            5.   Silt fence. Silt fences otherwise required for erosion control
are typically to be placed around and not through the critical root zones of
trees to be saved because the trench needed to install the silt fence would
otherwise cut through the tree roots and damage the tree.
         F.   Other. The Village Arborist may recommend and the Building
Department may require additional design criteria depending on special
circumstances on site.
      (3)   Tree bank fee. For those sites where replacement trees cannot
feasibly be planted on the same lot or nearby parkway, the property owner shall
pay a tree bank fee in lieu of planting a replacement tree. The tree plan shall
include a calculation of the tree bank fee, which shall be the average cost to
purchase the tree at retail from a local nursery as determined by the Village,
or from the supplier contracted with the Village, and transplant, water,
fertilize, and spray for pests for one year, plus twenty percent (20%) for an
average failure rate. The Village may estimate the average for such costs. The
tree bank fee is to be paid by the property owner to the Village when the tree
permit is issued. The Village shall use the tree bank fees to plant and
maintain trees elsewhere in the Village on public parkways or other public
property and to promote tree conservation.
   (For example, a homeowner who is building an addition does not have room on
his lot to plant the required replacement oak trees with a cumulative diameter
at breast height of six inches. The local nursery is selling two inch diameter
at breast height oak trees for two hundred and twenty-five dollars ($225.00)
each including transplanting. The Village determines the average cost to water
and apply fertilizer and insecticide for one year is fifty dollars ($50.00) per
tree. The tree bank fee is (3 x 225 + 3 x 50 =) eight hundred and twenty-five
dollars ($825.00).
      (4)   Payment of Tree Bank Fee Over Time. Notwithstanding Subsection (f)
(3) above, in the event that the tree bank fee exceeds twenty thousand dollars
($20,000), the property owner may petition the Village for approval of the
payment of the tree bank fee over a period of time, as opposed to paying the
entire tree bank fee at the time of the issuance of the tree permit by the
Village (hereinafter the “Tree Bank Payment Plan”). Upon a showing of good
cause by the property owner, as to why the tree bank fee cannot be paid in its
entirety at the time of the issuance of the tree permit, the Village Council
may approve a Tree Bank Payment Plan pursuant to an ordinance to be approved by
the Village Council. Any such Tree Bank Payment Plan Ordinance shall contain
the following provisions:
         A.   No less than fifty percent (50%) of the tree bank fee shall be
paid at the time of the issuance of the tree permit;
         B.   The portion of the tree bank fee that is not paid upon issuance
of the tree permit shall be paid over a defined period of time, in installments
as set forth in the ordinance, with the tree bank fee to be paid in full prior
to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the Village relative to the
improvement to the property, or any building or structure located thereon, that
necessitated the payment of the tree bank fee by the property owner, or the
issuance of any other certificate of occupancy that may be required from the
Village relative to the property in question;
         C.   The building permit that relates to the improvement to the
property, or any building or structure located thereon, that necessitated the
payment of a tree bank fee, shall be conditioned upon the payment, in full, of
the tree bank fee, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the
Village relative to said improvement to the property, or any building or
structure located thereon, that necessitate the payment of the tree bank fee,
or the issuance of any other certificate of occupancy that may be required from
the Village relative to the property in question;
         D.   An acceptance by the property owner of the terms and conditions
of the ordinance, with the property owner executing said provision within the
ordinance; and
         E.   The recording of the ordinance, against title to the property in
question, at the property owner’s sole cost and expense.

1461.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All new commercial development on vacant property, all redevelopment of
existing commercial properties wherein the existing structure(s) is to be razed
and a new commercial structure(s) built, all additions to existing commercial
structures and all landscaping of existing commercial properties shall, in
addition to complying with all other applicable provisions of this Code, comply
with the following criteria:
   (a)   Rooftop-mounted heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)
equipment and vents must be screened from view along all sides of a building as
judged from ground level from a maximum distance of 1,000 feet. Rooftop
screening shall incorporate elements from the exterior design of the building,
including shape and materials. Alternate screening devices will be considered
if appropriate to the overall design of the building.
   (b)   All roof vents, flues or other items projecting above the roof are to
be located on the side of the building least visible from the public rights-of-
way, provided that life-safety codes and building codes are not violated by
said location.
   (c)   Dumpster enclosures shall be attached to the rear of the building or
at a remote site location in the rear or side yard. They are to be of the same
primary material used elsewhere on the exterior of the building and shall be
screened by landscaping.
   (d)   Exterior building materials shall consist of either masonry or wood,
with the exception that up to thirty-five percent of the building's exterior
(subject to Building Code requirements) may be comprised of non-traditional
materials such as, but not limited to, dry-vit, vinyl and aluminum siding.
   (e)   Impervious surfaces on any commercial site shall be limited to no more
than eighty-five percent of the total site unless additional paving is required
to meet Village parking, loading and/or ingress-egress requirements. If
additional paving is required to meet parking, loading and/or ingress-egress
requirements, such additional paving shall be limited to the minimum necessary
to meet such requirements.
   (f)   Exterior lighting and signage shall be in compliance with the outdoor
lighting requirements as set forth in
Chapter 1476 of this Code and the sign requirements as set forth in

      (Ord. 2022-16. Passed 6-27-22.)
   (g)   Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Turf grass areas (lawns).  Turf grass areas (lawn) shall be limited
to a maximum of fifty percent of the total landscaped area on the site; the
remaining landscaped areas shall be planted with a ratio of native species to
non-native species of not less than two square feet of native species to every
one square foot of non-native species. The definition of "native species" shall
be the list of native plant species as set forth in the "Village of Palos Park
Native Plant Species List," a true and accurate copy of which is attached to
original Ordinance 2000-40, passed November 27, 2000, as Exhibit A, and
incorporated herein by reference, as amended from time to time. The Village
Clerk shall maintain copies of the current "Village of Palos Park Native Plant
Species List" for review by, and distribution to, all applicants for
certification herein, as well as the general public. Any plant species not
found on said list shall constitute a "non-native" species for purposes of this
Code. Artificial plants are not to be used within the landscaped areas or on
the building. Use of artificial mulches in lieu of natural (organic) mulches is
prohibited. Proper drainage is required for all planting areas to ensure the
establishment of good root systems and healthy growth.
      (2)   Parking lot landscaping.
         A.   Interior landscaping. Concrete curbed parking lot landscaping
areas (landscape islands) shall be located at the end of each parking row and
provided within the parking lot to divide a parking row so that no more than
twenty adjacent parking spaces are located in any length of a single parking
row without a landscaping area.
         B.   Area of landscape island. Landscape islands shall be a minimum of
130 square feet in area and a minimum of eight feet in width, as measured from
back of curb to back of curb.
         C.   Type of landscape material. One shade tree of a minimum of two
and one-half inches in diameter, as measured six inches above the established
ground level, shall be provided for each 130 square feet of landscape island,
or portion thereof. In addition to said shade tree requirement, a minimum of
fifty percent of every landscape island shall be planted with live plant
material, such as shrubs, ground cover or turf grass (lawn), with said plant
materials selected so as to attain a maximum height of not more than thirty
inches at maturity. The remaining area of the landscape island shall be covered
with natural (organic) mulch.
         D.   Visibility. To ensure proper visibility within the parking lot,
shrubs shall be no greater than thirty inches in height and the branches of
trees shall start no less than six feet above the pavement level.
         E.   Protection. In locations where plant material will be susceptible
to injury by pedestrian or motor traffic, said plant materials shall be
protected by appropriate curbs, tree guards or other devices.
         F.   Prohibited vegetation. Thorny trees and bushes are prohibited
within the parking lot.
      (3)   Landscaping and screening. All commercial property shall be
effectively screened from residential properties which the commercial property
abuts, or that are next to and/or directly across from the commercial
property's front yard, by a berm, plantings or combination thereof. Plantings
under this paragraph shall consist of a densely planted compact hedge of
coniferous trees, or plant material of similar density, along all sides of the
property abutting adjacent property. Such berm or plantings shall be at least
four feet in height.
      (4)   Landscape buffer.  All off-street parking areas open to the sky
shall, where they abut a residential property line and/or are located directly
across from residential front yards, be separated from said property line by a
landscape buffer located a minimum fifteen feet from the property line. The
criteria for plantings in said landscape buffer shall be the same as provided
in this subsection (g).
      (5)   Trees. Trees shall be planted along all sides of a commercial
property, including all parkways within Village public rights-of-way that abut
the property. Trees shall not be required under existing overhead public
utilities. Trees shall have a trunk diameter, measured six inches above the
ground, of not less than two and one-half inches, and shall be spaced not more
than thirty feet apart. Chinese elm, box elder, willow, poplar and similar
fast-growing brittle wood species are prohibited.
      (6)   Sprinkler systems. All landscaped areas are required to have
underground sprinkler systems that will irrigate all turf grass (lawn) and
plant materials within said landscaped areas.
      (7)   Installation prior to issuance of occupancy permit. Landscaping and
screening shall be completely installed prior to the issuance of any temporary
or final occupancy permit. When weather conditions do not allow for completion
of landscaping and screening, a letter of credit in the amount of 110 percent
of the engineer's estimate for completion of said landscaping and screening
must be tendered to the Village to obtain a temporary occupancy permit. A final
occupancy permit will be issued only after all landscaping and screening is
installed.
      (8)   Maintenance. All landscape materials shall be maintained in good
condition so as to present a healthy appearance, and shall be kept free of
refuse and debris. Plant materials shall be replaced when dead or dying.

Council that the application and plans be approved. If a majority of those
members of the Plan Commission present at the meeting at which the application
and plans are reviewed determine, by a vote of said members, that one or more
of the applicable criteria have not been met, the applicant shall have the
option of either: (1) continuing the matter before the Plan Commission to a
future meeting and revising the application and plans to address the item(s) of
noncompliance; or (2) requesting that a written recommendation of the Plan
Commission's decision be made to the Village Council to be considered at the
next regular meeting of the Village Council.
   (d)   The Village Council shall consider the recommendation of the Plan
Commission at the first regular meeting of the Village Council following
receipt of the Plan Commission's recommendation. If a majority of those members
of the Village Council present at the meeting at which the application, plans
and Plan Commission recommendation are reviewed determine, by a vote of said
members, that the application and plans submitted are in compliance with all of
the commercial construction and landscape criteria set forth in Section
1461.01, the application and plans shall be deemed approved and a written
certificate of compliance evidencing such approval shall be forwarded to the
Building Department. If a majority of those members of the Village Council
present at the meeting at which the application, plans and Plan Commission
recommendation are reviewed determine, by a vote of said members, that one or
more of the applicable criteria have not been met, the applicant shall have the
option of continuing the matter to a future Council meeting and revising the
application and plans to address the item(s) of noncompliance; otherwise, the
application and plans shall be deemed rejected and no building permit shall be
issued.

Village by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8 and 5/11-31-2. The
purpose of this chapter is to maintain this Village's eligibility in the
National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic
flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic
and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes:
   (a)   To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/18(g) Rivers, Lakes and Streams
Act;
   (b)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   (c)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (d)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (e)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (f)   To make Federally subsidized flood insurance available to properties
in the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   (g)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
   (h)   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (i)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.

1462.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
   (1)   Accessory structure. A non-habitable building which is on the same
parcel of property as the principal building to be insured and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal building.
   (2)   Act. An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and
streams of the State of Illinois, 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq.
   (3)   Applicant. Any person, firm, corporation or agency that applies for a
floodplain development permit.
   (4)   Appropriate uses. Only uses of the designated floodway that are
permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will
be allowed are as specified in Section
1462.06(c).
   (5)   ASCE. American Society of Civil Engineers.
   (6)   Base flood. The flood having a one percent probability of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-
year frequency flood.
   (7)   Base flood elevation (BFE). The height in relation to the North
American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified) of the
crest of the base flood. Application of the BFE at any location is as defined
in Section
1462.05 of this chapter.
   (8)   Basement. Any area of the building, including any sunken room or
sunken portion of a room, having its floor below ground level (subgrade) on all
sides.
   (9)   Building. A walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid
storage tank, that is principally above ground, including manufactured homes
and prefabricated buildings. This term also includes recreational vehicles and
travel trailers installed on a site for more than 180 consecutive days (or 180
days in any calendar year).
   (10)   Channel. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or
artificial depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert,

bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows,
either perennially or intermittently.
   (11)   Channel modification. Alteration of a channel by changing the
physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification
includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,
straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation
from the bottom or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of
dead or dying vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. Channelization is a
severe form of channel modification involving a significant change in the
channel cross-section and typically involving relocation of the existing
channel (e.g. straightening).
   (12)   Compensatory storage. An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the floodplain used to balance the loss of
natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed
within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can
increase off-site floodwater elevations and flows.

   (15)   Critical facility. Any facility which is critical to the health and
welfare of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to
the disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of
vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or
can put special populations at risk.
   (16)   Dam. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with
their abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of

a waterway, the more recent effective floodway limit shall prevail.
      B.   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the FIRM map and located on a
site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is
needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

to Section 1462.09.
      (1)   Determine the market value or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building before the start of construction of the proposed work. In the case
of repair, the market value of the building shall be the market value before
the damage occurred and before any repairs are made.
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building.
      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or substantial damage.
      (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of the Village and this
chapter is required.

1462.06 OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood by proper elevation, compliance
with compensatory storage requirements, and other applicable provisions of this
chapter. No use will be permitted that adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this Section, along with the requirements of
Section
1462.09.
   (a)   Development Permit.
      (1)   No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body shall commence
any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a development permit
from the Building Commissioner.
      (2)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form
provided by the Building Commissioner.
         A.   The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site,
drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a Registered P.E, licensed architect or Registered Land
Surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the NAVD 88, and all proposed
changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all existing and proposed buildings and additions to buildings.
         B.   For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of Section
1462.09 of this chapter.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Building
Commissioner shall compare the elevation of the site to the BFE.
         A.   Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the BFE of the current FIRM and which has not been filled after the date
of the site's first floodplain designation on a FIRM, is not in the floodplain
and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
         B.   Any development located on land shown to be below the BFE that is
hydraulically connected to the floodplain, but not shown on the current FIRM,
is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
         C.   The Building Commissioner shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first FIRM
identification in the floodplain.
      (4)   The Building Commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals
or waivers that may be required for this type of activity, as specified in this
chapter. The Building Commissioner shall not issue a permit unless all other
federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.
      (5)   A development permit or approval shall become invalid unless the
actual start of construction, as defined in Section
1462.02, for work authorized by such permit, is commenced within 180 days after
its issuance, or if the work authorized is suspended or abandoned for a period
of 180 days after the work commences. All permitted work shall be completed
within eighteen (18) months after the date of issuance of the permit or the
permit shall expire. Time extensions, of not more than 180 days each, may be
granted, in writing, by the Building Commissioner. Time extensions shall be
granted only if the original permit is compliant with this chapter and the FIRM
and FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.
   (b)   Preventing Increased Damages.   
      (1)   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public
health and safety.
      (2)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the BFE, the
applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a LOMR from FEMA for the
purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
      (3)   Compensatory Storage.
         A.   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically
equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the BFE.
         B.   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.25 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
         C.   In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be
made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
         D.   All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-percent annual
chance flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-percent annual
chance flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-
percent annual chance flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-
percent annual chance flood elevation.
         E.   All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
   (c)   Construction of a Building under a LOMR Based on Fill.   
         A person who has obtained a LOMR Based on Fill, which removes a site
in the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may
apply for a permit from the Village to construct the lowest floor of a building
below the BFE in the floodplain. The Building Commissioner shall not issue such
a permit unless the applicant has demonstrated that the building will be
reasonably safe from flooding. The Building Commissioner shall require a
professional certification from a qualified design professional that indicates
the land or buildings to be removed from the SFHA are reasonably safe from
flooding, according to the criteria established in FEMA Technical Bulletin (TB)
10. Professional certification may come from a professional engineer,
professional geologist, professional soil scientist, or other design
professional qualified to make such evaluations.
         The Building Commissioner shall maintain records, including but not
limited to, all correspondence, professional certification, existing and
proposed grading, sump pump sizing, foundation plans, elevation certificates,
compensatory storage calculations, soil testing and compaction data.

      (4)   The Building Commissioner shall be responsible for obtaining from
the applicant copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits and
approvals that may be required for this type of activity.
         1.   The Building Commissioner shall not issue the development permit
unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained.
         2.   A Licensed P.E. under the employ or contract of the Village shall
review and approve applications reviewed under this chapter.
   (c)   Preventing Increased Damages and a List of Appropriate Uses.
      (1)   The only development in a floodway allowed are appropriate uses
that will not cause a rise in the BFE and will not create a damaging or
potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity, be a threat to
public health and safety and welfare, impair the natural hydrologic and
hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing
water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by
appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those
appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         A.   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
         B.   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
         C.   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
         D.   Underground and overhead utilities;
         E.   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of Flood flows, and including
open air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage.
         F.   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
         G.   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
         H.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            1.   The depth of flooding during the base flood will not exceed
1.0 foot; or
            2.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events.
         I.   Aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation where
the depth of flooding during the base flood will not exceed 1.0 foot;
         J.   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slop toward a watercourse;
         K.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
buildings including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating
buildings, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal buildings where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten (10) feet away from the exterior wall of the existing
building, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the
building;
         L.   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty (50%) percent or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the FPE;
         M.   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the BFE, and which will not block
flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks,
patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to fifty (50%)
percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a
substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the
FPE.
      (2)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of
any new buildings, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
      (3)   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate
use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets
the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing
with supporting plans, calculations and data by a Registered P.E. and provided
that any building meets the protection requirements of Section
1462.10 of this chapter:
         A.   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the base flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the
following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            1.   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where
"n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)).
            2.   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a Federal,
State, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
            3.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
               c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used.
               d.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
               e.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         B.   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding.
            1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            2.   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
1.25 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            3.   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            4.   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed BFE. All
designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-percent annual chance
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-percent annual chance
flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-
percent annual chance flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-
percent annual chance flood elevation. All such excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
            5.   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            6.   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area, as a
result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at an existing structure.
         C.   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
            1.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the base flood event.
            2.   In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
         D.   Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway
Approaches.   
            1.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood event; or
the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks
(or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within
the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded
flood easements.
            2.   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
               a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in this chapter. Bridges and
culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic
models.
               b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per this
chapter.
               c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per this chapter.
               d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public body of water
that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must
be received.
               e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by Section
1462.06(c).
               f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed per Section
1462.06.
         E.   Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and
Approach Roads.
            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1-foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the base flood event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to structures in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the existing
bridge or culvert and roadway approach to reduce the existing backwater, taking
into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream
properties.
            3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         F.   On-Stream Structures Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water.
            1.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the base flood event shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded
flood easements.
            2.   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            3.   All dams and impoundment structures, as defined in Section
1462.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
               A.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater
detention;
               B.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               C.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation
basin;
               D.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               E.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of
Section
1462.07.
         G.   Excavation in the Floodway.
            1.   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               A.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; and
               B.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and
               C.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one-foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used; and
               D.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         H.   General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations.
            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in Section
1462.06, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
            2.   If the floodway elevation at the site of the proposed
construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a
larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet:
               A.   The requirements of this section for the BFEs of the
designated floodway conditions; and
               B.   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.   
            3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a public flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         I.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision.
            1.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the BFE, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR
and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a
conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is
issued.   
            2.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. All
field surveys shall be conducted under the supervision of a Registered P.E. or
Registered Land Surveyor and shall be sealed. All required engineering analyses
shall be conducted under the supervision of a Registered P. E., or in the case
of a federal project, by the federal agency and shall be so sealed or stated.
            3.   In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            4.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.

activities shall take place until a final LOMR is issued by FEMA with
concurrence from IDNR/OWR.   
         J.   Professional Engineer's Supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a Registered P.E.
         K.   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as-built
plans.
      (4)   Permits for Dams.

applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the
Village Council. The village may attach such conditions to granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the flood protection intent of this
chapter.
   (c)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates, that
all of the following conditions are met:   
      (1)   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      (2)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      (3)   The variance granted is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief;
      (4)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety,
destruction of beneficial stream uses and functions including, aquatic habitat,

      (8)   All other required State and Federal permits or waivers have been
obtained.
   (d)   The Building Commissioner shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of Section
1462.09 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
      (2)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (3)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant will acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk
and liability.
   (e)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site
or historic structure may be granted to allow repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures using criteria more permissive than the requirements of
Sections
1462.11(c) and (d) subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the building; and
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's
continued designation as a historic structure.
   (f)   The findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the Zoning Board
of Appeals, the notifications required by this chapter, and a record of
hearings and evidence considered as justification for the issuance of all
variances from this chapter shall be maintained by the village in perpetuity.

1462.12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur, or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the
floodplain, will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create
liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder.

1462.13 NOTICE OF VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.
   (a)   Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or
failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the village may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
village shall notify the owner in writing of such violation via personal
service or U.S. Mail.
   (b)   If such owner fails, after ten days from the date the written notice
is issued, to correct the violation:

violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore
may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner is authorized to issue an order requiring
the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in
writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work
order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (2)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state: (1) the
grounds for compliant or reasons for suspension or revocation; and (2) the time
and place of the hearing. At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an
opportunity to present evidence on his/her behalf. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals determine whether the permit shall be
suspended or revoked.
   (f)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.

1466.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter establishes a procedure for the regulation of grading, filling,
excavating or altering of the natural terrain or other aspects of the existing
topography on property, including, but not limited to, the final grading of
property, in the Village.
   This chapter is established generally to prevent unnecessary flooding, to
eliminate damage to real and personal property and to protect the public
health, welfare and safety of the Village.
   More specifically, this chapter is enacted to regulate the grading, filling,
excavating or altering of final grading of individual parcels of land, as the
grading affects the subject parcel, as well as that property directly or
indirectly affected by the parcel, both public and private. The review of final
grading plans, as specified in this chapter, will be the review of the
individual parcel as the individual parcel relates to and affects, or is
affected by, the balance of the subdivision, PUD or adjoining or adjacent
property.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:

1466.03 GRADING PERMITS; FEES.
   (a)   Generally. No person shall erect, move or substantially improve a
structure, or fill or excavate a parcel of land, within the Village, without
first obtaining a grading permit or a waiver of such requirement. All
applications for grading permits shall be accompanied by a fee of five hundred
dollars ($500.00). If it is determined by the Building Department that a
grading permit is not required, the fee shall be refunded.
   If it is determined that a grading permit is required, the fee for said
permit shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00) plus the actual costs incurred by
the Village in using independent contractor consultants to review the grading
permit application, which amount shall be deducted from the five hundred
dollars ($500.00) which accompanied the permit application. Should said permit
fee be less
than five hundred dollars ($500.00), the balance on deposit will be returned to
the applicant along with the grading permit. Should said permit fee exceed said
five hundred dollar ($500.00) amount, no grading permit shall issue until the
applicant has paid the balance due.
   (b)   Exceptions. A grading permit may not be required on certain
improvements under the following classifications, as determined by the Building
Commissioner:
   Any changes to an existing structure, including additions or alterations to
an existing structure, that do not affect storm water drainage to the parcel in
question or do not affect storm water drainage to adjoining property, unless
the Building Commissioner finds to the contrary.
   (c)   Issuance and Administration.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner will be responsible for issuance of all
grading permits and for the administration of this chapter. Every grading
permit shall expire by limitation and shall become null and void if the work
authorized by such permit has not begun within ninety days from the date of
issuance thereof. In the case of such expiration and cancellation, the
Commissioner shall provide written notice thereof to their permittee.
      (2)   If the work described in the grading permit has not been
substantially completed within one year of the date of issuance thereof, such
permit shall be expired and canceled by the Commissioner and written notice
thereof shall be given to the permittee, together with a notice that further
work is prohibited. No work shall proceed on the canceled permit until a
special grading permit has been issued by the Village.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Commissioner, such special grading permit
may be issued based on the original application and permit, or the Commissioner
may require submission of a new application. The special grading permit may
include limitations on time allowed for substantial completion of the work. All
special grading permits shall be accompanied by a reasonable performance bond
in an amount and form satisfactory to the Village. The performance bond shall
provide surety for the completion of the improvements covered by the permit,
within the time limit set by the Commissioner.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91; Ord. 1998-32. Passed 10-26-98.)
1466.04 GRADING PLANS.
   (a)   A grading permit will be required and shall necessitate the submission
of grading plans. The grading plans must be approved by the Village, and a
grading permit issued by the Village, before the following activities can
commence:
      (1)   Construction of a new structure in a subdivision or planned unit
development where an overall grading plan has been approved by the corporate
authorities or a parcel is subject to such overall grading plan.
      (2)   Construction of a new structure in an established subdivision or
planned unit development that does not have an approved overall grading plan.
      (3)   The movement of a structure from a parcel of land that affects such
parcel, or the parcel to which it is being moved.
      (4)   Any filling or excavation on a parcel of land that affects such
parcel or any other parcel.
      (5)   The damming, altering, obstructing or changing of natural terrain
or a waterway or watercourse carrying natural drainage from upstream property.
      (6)   Any change to an existing structure, including additions or
alterations to an existing structure that could affect storm water drainage to
the parcel being improved or to the adjoining property, as determined by the
Building Commissioner.
   (b)   Any grading plan submitted pursuant to the requirements of this
chapter shall contain the following information and be consistent with the
following requirements:
      (1)   Foundation elevation, including the top of the foundation and any
openings below the top of the foundation, on all new or existing structures or
portions thereof, shall be shown.
      (2)   Site drainage shall be indicated, showing existing and proposed
grades for a particular parcel, and for adjoining properties affected, with a
minimum of one-foot contour intervals, in sufficient detail to clearly indicate
drainage flows.
      (3)   The parcel drainage shall be designed to flow away from the top of
the foundations. Storm water being directed to the side yard of the parcel
shall be directed into a formed drainage swale, having a minimum slope of two
percent and a maximum slope of ten percent. The side slopes of any drainage
swale shall not exceed a 3:1 slope. Bank stabilization will be required if
deemed necessary by the Village Engineer.
      In the event that conditions dictate that some parts of the lot be higher
than the structure foundation, the grading must show specific drainage
configurations for the parcel, specifying that all drainage is to be directed
to flow away from the foundation.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing drainage swale slope and side slope
requirements, the Village Engineer shall have the authority to approve a
drainage swale slope and/or slide slope, that is not in compliance with the
foregoing requirements, in the event that the site conditions do not allow for
compliance with said requirements.
      (4)   Construction and work, such as walkways, driveways, landscaping or
any structure, shall be installed so that construction of the same will not
interfere with drainage. All sidewalks, driveways, patios and other flat work
shall be at an elevation relative to the foundation wall, so that water will
drain away from the structure on all sides and off the lot in a manner which
will provide reasonable freedom from erosion and permanently pocketed surface
water.
      (5)   The flow from off-site tributary areas that are tributary to an
intermittent stream or overflow route that must pass through the parcel must be
identified on the grading plan, and a conveyance system must be designed in
such a way to adequately handle the flow of all water to accommodate a 100-year
storm frequency.
      (6)   All overflow routes for the 100-year storm and for accumulated
storm water runoff from several lots, or from off-site catchment areas, must be
clearly designated on the grading plan with the total width of the flow route
contained within an easement for drainage purposes.
      (7)   Evidence must be given to document that the flow leaving the
developed parcel does not adversely affect the downstream system. If the
existing receiving system is inadequate to handle the 100-year flow as
calculated, detention will be required to ensure that the release from the
improved parcel does not cause downstream flooding.
      (8)   If applicable, all wetland boundaries must be shown, and a
construction permit from the Army Corps of Engineers acquired, prior to Village
approval.
      (9)   If applicable, all floodplain and floodway boundaries must be
shown, and all applicable standards met, for construction in these areas,
including, but not limited to, any necessary permits required by
Chapter 1462 of this Code, prior to Village approval.
   (c)   All storm water management facilities within any development must be
constructed in accordance with the plans provided by the permittee's design
engineer and approved by the Village Engineer. The design drawings must be
certified by a registered professional engineer, and provided on standard
twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch sheets. Smaller individual parcels may be
submitted on a smaller appropriate size.

1466.05 SUBDIVISIONS AND PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   In a subdivision or a planned unit development, all rough grading within a
given block (or area) must be completed prior to the issuance of any building
permits. The developer, through his or her project engineer, shall certify in
writing that all rough grading is complete within a given block, watershed or
other area in strict conformity with the grading plan, as submitted and
approved by the Village. The Village Engineer shall verify that grading is
complete as required and so notify the Village, before building can proceed.
All proposed drainage ways, swales, detention facilities and lot and block
grading shall be complete to ensure minimum effect and disturbance upon
properties adjoining such development or other portions within the development.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.06 BUILDING PERMITS.
   No building permit shall be issued without a concurrent application for the
issuance of a grading permit. In the case of an internal building change, that
is, a change occurring completely within a building, or as provided in Section
1466.03(b) a grading permit will not be required. The issuance of a building
permit and grading permit shall be concurrent.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.07 OCCUPANCY SURVEY.
   Immediately after the final parcel grading has been accomplished, but before
final seeding, sodding or landscaping takes place, the permittee shall conduct
an occupancy survey to determine if the grading has been done in conformity
with the approved grading plan. Said occupancy survey must be submitted to and
approved by the Village prior to the issuance of a final occupancy permit.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.08 EASEMENTS.
   Whenever a natural watercourse, waterway, drainage swale or the like,
draining two tributary acres or more, crosses through a parcel or any part of a
parcel, a drainage easement will be required before a grading permit or a
building permit will be issued. The Village Engineer will verify the total
tributary area draining through the subject parcel or part thereof and the
expected runoff, to determine the required capacity of the natural watercourse
and will make recommendations on the size of permanent easements.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.09 CONDITIONAL OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   (a)   If a parcel cannot be final graded because of adverse weather
conditions or other conditions beyond the control of the permittee, the
Building Commissioner may issue a conditional occupancy permit. The conditional
occupancy permit shall be effective for only the reasonable number of days
sufficient to sustain the adverse weather conditions or the other conditions
that were beyond the permittee's control. In those instances where a
conditional occupancy permit is to be issued, the permittee shall furnish a
cash bond or irrevocable letter of credit, in a form acceptable to the Village,
in the amount of 110 percent of the Village Engineer's estimate of the cost of
completing all required grading work. In the event that the grading work is not
completed prior to the date on which said conditional occupancy expires, the
Village shall be entitled to use said cash bond or the proceeds of the
irrevocable letter of credit to complete the grading work on behalf of the
property owner.
(Ord. 1999-29. Passed 7-26-99.)
   (b)   At the time of the issuance of a conditional occupancy permit, the
permittee, builder or owner shall sign a document informing him or her of the
provisions necessary to obtain a final occupancy permit. The document referred
to herein shall be signed by the permittee, builder or owner prior to the time
the conditional occupancy permit is issued. At the time of application for a
conditional occupancy permit, the Building Commissioner shall determine the
reasonable number of days for the permittee's compliance with the requirements
of a final occupancy permit, based upon the weather conditions or other
conditions that made the issuance of a final occupancy permit unreasonable.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.10 NONCONFORMITY WITH APPROVED GRADING PLANS.
   Any deviation from the approved grading plans as attached to the grading
permit shall require the resubmission of a grading plan indicating what changes
are necessary as a result of the noncompliance with the approved grading plans.
The revised grading plan application shall include the size information as
required in the case of an application for an original grading permit. All work
on the parcel shall terminate until such time as new grading plans are
submitted by the permittee and approved by the Village. All persons aggrieved
by a decision or decisions of the Building Commissioner shall have the right to
appeal to the Plan Commission by serving fourteen days written notice on the
Plan Commission through the Village Clerk. A public hearing on the appeal shall
be conducted, with notice given to adjoining property owners in all cases
involving appeals that may have substantial adverse effects on adjoining
property.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.11 FINAL OCCUPANCY PERMITS.
   Upon completion of final grading and the installation of protective ground
cover in substantial conformity with the approved plans, a final occupancy
permit shall be issued to the holder of the grading permit. However, in those
cases where nonconformity with the Village ordinances, does not permit the
issuance of a final occupancy permit, such permit shall not be issued.
Determination of conformity with the approved grading plans shall be made by
the Building Commissioner.
(Ord. 1991-53. Passed 10-28-91.)
1466.99 PENALTY; EQUITABLE REMEDIES.
   (a)   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more
than five hundred dollars ($500.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation continues beyond the
compliance date set forth in the notice.
   (b)   In addition to any fine which may be imposed hereunder, the Village
may seek a mandatory order of compliance or such other or further equitable
relief as a court of competent jurisdiction may grant.

1470.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Land development projects alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
      (2)   This storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants; and
      (3)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff from
development sites.
   (b)   In light of the foregoing, the Village hereby establishes this set of
water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide
reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and
other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in
storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public
interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum storm water management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety,
and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the jurisdiction of the
Village. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
   (a)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in order
to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
   (b)   Minimize pollution caused by storm water runoff from development that
would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and
   (d)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the
Village under the provisions of Section
1470.08 below.
   This chapter shall also apply to land development activities that are
smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of
a larger common plan of development that meets the applicability criteria set
forth in this chapter, even though multiple separate and distinct land
development activities may take place at different times on different
schedules.
   (b)   To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the Village has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites, if determined to be applicable by the Village. These standards apply to
any construction activity disturbing one acre or more of land. The following
activities shall be exempt from these storm water performance criteria:
      (1)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures;
      (2)   Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
provided that they are not part of a larger common development plan; and
      (3)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the Village.
   (c)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in Section
1470.06, decisions on permitting shall be determined by the Building
Commissioner or his or her designee, and on-site storm water requirements shall
be determined by the Village Engineer and the Director of Public Works or his
or her designee. This determination shall be dependent upon the amount of
impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality.
Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a
review by the Village.

required by this chapter, unless this requirement is waived by the Village.
      (2)   The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived
in whole or in part upon request of the applicant, provided that at least one
of the following conditions applies:
         A.   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter;
         B.   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the Village and the implementation of the plan is required
by ordinance;
         C.   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site
facility, with the off-site facility being required to be in place, to be
designed and adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices, and
there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and
maintenance of the storm water practice;
         D.   The Village finds that meeting the minimum on-site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site; or
         E.   Non-structural practices as explained in detail in the Illinois
Urban Manual will be used on the site that reduces:
            1.   The generation of storm water from the site;
            2.   The size and cost of storm water storage; and
            3.   The pollutants generated at the site.
   (b)   Assurances Required for Waiver. In instances where one of the
conditions set forth in subsection (a)(2) above applies, the Village may grant
a waiver from strict compliance with these storm water management provisions,
as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible
for a waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village
that the wavier will not result in the following impacts to downstream
waterways:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; or
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and
property.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.09 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the Village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all
sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible, establish
storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water
discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for
storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent
practical.
   (b)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the Illinois Urban
Manual.
   (c)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm
water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under
the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement applies
to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (d)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Village
to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements.
   (e)   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the MWRDGC
shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices where applicable.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.10 BASIC STORM WATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture storm
water runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to wet
bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent to or near existing wetlands
or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the Village and all
flows from the development shall be routed through the basin.
   (b)   Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain
developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the
Village. Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout
the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and
to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
   (c)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation, wetlands and water quality
mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions of the property
exclusively for storm water management.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.11 POST CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT.
   The requirements of Chapter IV (D)(2)(b) of NPDES permit No. ILR10,
including management practices, controls and other provisions at least as
protective as the requirements contained in the Illinois Urban Manual, most
recent edition, are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein,
relative to post construction management of on-site facilities and off-site
facilities. In addition, the long term operation and maintenance of all Best
Management Practices (BMPs) shall be provided for in regard to the post
construction management of each on-site facility and each off-site facility.
(Ord. 2008-06. Passed 2-25-08.)
1470.12 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Stop-Work Order; Revocation of Permit. In the event that any person
holding a site development permit pursuant to this chapter violates the terms
of the permit or implements site development in such a manner as to materially
adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working
in the neighborhood of the development site, so as to be materially detrimental
to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the
neighborhood, the Village may suspend or revoke the site development permit.
   (b)   Violation and Penalties. No person shall construct, enlarge, alter,
repair, or maintain any grading, excavation, or fill, or cause the same to be
done, contrary to or in violation of any terms of this chapter. Upon conviction
of any violation of this chapter, such person shall be punished by a fine of
seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense, with each day during
which any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter occurs
constituting a separate and distinct offense. In addition to any other penalty
authorized by this chapter, any person convicted of violating any of the
provisions of this chapter shall be required to bear the expense of any
necessary restoration of the site.

may be denied by the Village  Manager  summarily, and without hearing, on a
finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where
such application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be required to
establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application
prior to being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds
are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
   (d)   Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second
application filed more than two years after the final denial of a prior
application shall be heard on the merits as though no prior application had
been filed. The applicant shall be required, however, to place in the record
all evidence available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have
developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such
evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new
petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.

and criteria specified in this chapter.
   (b)   Exemption. Certificates of Appropriateness shall not be required in
connection with permits necessary for compliance with a lawful order of the

other physical modifications from Certificate of Appropriateness procedures,
(2) such order is limited to the minimum relief necessary to correct the
immediate health or safety problem, and (3) such order is written to avoid
insofar as possible any damage to any feature of historical significance and
provided, further, that such order may be subject to appropriate conditions to
advance the purpose and goals of this title.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)
1498.02 CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   All applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall conform to the
applicable standards in this section:
   (a)   General Standards:
      (1)   Alterations that do not affect any essential architectural or
historic features of a structure or building as viewed from a public or private
street or other right-of-way ordinarily should be permitted.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a structure,
building, or site and its environment should not be destroyed. No alteration of
any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should be permitted
except when necessary to assure an economically viable use of a site.
      (3)   All structures, buildings, and sites should be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that
seek to create an earlier appearance than the true age of the property are
discouraged.
      (4)   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a structure, building, or site and
its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own
right, and this significance should be recognized and respected when dealing
with a specific architectural period.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a structure, building, or site ordinarily should be
maintained and preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures and buildings should be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning
methods that will damage the structures and buildings should be avoided.
      (8)   New structures or buildings or alterations to sites should not be
discouraged when such structures or alterations do not destroy significant
historical or architectural features and are compatible with the size, scale,
color, material, and character of the site, neighborhood, or environment.
      (9)   Whenever possible, new structures or buildings or alterations to
the existing conditions of sites should be done in such a manner that, if such
new structures or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential
form and integrity of the original structure, building, or site would be
unimpaired.
      (10)   Any permitted alteration should promote the purposes of this title
and general welfare of the Village and its residents.
      (11)   Demolition should not be permitted if a structure, building, or
site is economically viable in its present condition or could be economically
viable after completion of appropriate alterations, even if demolition would
permit a more profitable use of such site.
   (b)   Design Standards:
      (1)   Height. The height of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with the height of the original landmark.
      (2)   Relationship between mass and open space. The relationship between
a landmark and adjacent open spaces after its alteration should be compatible
with such relationship prior to such alteration.
      (3)   Relationship among height, width, and scale. The relationship among
the height, width, and scale of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with such relationship prior to such alteration.
      (4)   Directional expression. The directional expressions of a landmark
after alteration, whether its vertical or horizontal positioning, should be
compatible with the directional expression of the original landmark.
      (5)   Roof shape. The roof shape of a landmark after alteration should be
compatible with the roof shape of the original landmark.
      (6)   Architectural details, general designs, materials, textures, and
colors. The architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and
colors of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the
architectural details, general design, materials, textures, and colors of the
original landmark.
      (7)   Landscape and appurtenances. The landscape and appurtenances,
including without limitation signs, fences, accessory structures, and pavings,
of a landmark after alteration should be compatible with the landscape and
appurtenances of the original landmark.
   (c)   Additional Standards: In addition to the foregoing standards, the
Commission may consider the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (Revised 1983),
and any amendments thereto, in reviewing any application under this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)
1498.03 APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   Any person proposing an alteration to, or seeking a building, sign, or other
permit for, any designated landmark shall submit a formal application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness as a precondition to commencing such alteration
or obtaining such permit. The formal application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall include the following information and specifications:
   (a)   The applicant's name;
   (b)   The owner's name, if different from applicant;
   (c)   The street address and legal description of the site;
   (d)   A brief description of the structures, buildings, and objects on the
site and the structures, buildings, and objects on site adjacent to and across
from such original site;
   (e)   A detailed description of the proposed alteration, together with any
architectural drawings, sketches, and photographs indicating how and to what
extent such alteration shall affect a landmark;
   (f)   The names and addresses of the owners of property adjacent to and
across from the site;
   (g)   A list and photographs of significant architectural features in
relation to the structures, buildings, or objects on the site previously
designated by the Commission as being worthy of protection and preservation;
   (h)   The identification of any architect or developer involved in the
alteration; and
   (i)   Such other relevant information as requested by the Village Manager or
the Commission.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)
1498.04 PUBLIC HEARING.
   After the proper filing of a complete application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness, a public hearing on the application shall be set, noticed, and
conducted in accordance with the provisions contained in
Chapter 1490. The hearing shall be commenced not fewer than thirty days after
the filing of a complete application and may be continued on request or consent
of the applicant.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)
1498.05 DECISION OF THE COMMISSION.
   (a)   Approval. If the application is approved without conditions, then the
Commission shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness permitting the
Building Commissioner to proceed with other required reviews and approvals. The
Commission shall notify the applicants of its decision within thirty days after
the close of the public hearing.
   (b)   Approval with Conditions. If the application is approved with
conditions, the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing and shall
specify the conditions to be imposed and the reasons therefor in light of the
criteria applicable to this chapter. If the applicant notifies the Commission
in writing that the conditions are acceptable, or if the applicant does not
appeal the approval with conditions within the prescribed period of time, then
the Commission shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness, subject to the
conditions.
   (c)   Denial. If the application is denied, then the Commission shall notify
the applicant in writing and shall specify the particulars in which the
application is inconsistent with the criteria applicable to this chapter. If
the Commission issues a denial of the Certificate of Appropriateness, then no
alteration shall be permitted to proceed, and no permits shall be issued for,
the proposed alteration, signage, or any other physical modifications of, the
designated landmark.
   (d)   Validity. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be invalid if the
plans approved by the Commission are changed, if any conditions of the
Certificate are not satisfied, or if any building permit issued for the
approved work becomes invalid. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall remain
valid for a period of one year.
   (e)   Appeal. When a Certificate of Appropriateness for a designated
landmark is denied or contains conditions that are unacceptable to the
applicant, the applicant may appeal the Commission's decision to the Council by
filing an appeal in writing to the Village Manager within fifteen days after
the applicant is served with notice by personal delivery or certified or
registered mail of the Commission's decision. The fifteen-day deadline may be
extended by the Village Manager for up to fifteen additional days on request by
the applicant made prior to the expiration of the original fifteen-day period.
For the purposes of this section, the date of mailing or delivery shall be the
date of service. The Council may receive comments on the contents of the record
but no new matter may be considered by the Council. The Council may affirm the
decision, overturn the decision, or recommend changes, after due consideration
of the facts contained in the record.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)
1498.06 CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the this chapter to the contrary,
the Commission may issue a Certificate of Economic Hardship to allow the
performance of work for which a Certificate of Appropriateness has been denied.
   (a)   State Assistance. Applicants claiming economic hardship shall be
required to apply to the State Historic Preservation Agency to determine
eligibility for rehabilitation assistance. The eligibility for and availability
of financial aid shall be considered by the Commission in making its decision.
   (b)   Application Requirements. An applicant for a Certificate of Economic
Hardship may submit any or all of the following information in order to assist
the Commission in making its determination on the application:
      (1)   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the

to the two most recent assessments.
      (3)   Real estate taxes for the previous two years.

      (6)   Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and
offers received, if any.
      (7)   Any consideration by the owner as to profitable adaptive uses for
the property.
      (8)   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two years, itemized operating and maintenance

proprietorship, for-profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership,
joint venture, or other.
      (10)   Any other information including income tax bracket of the owner,
applicant, or principal investors in the property, reasonably necessary for a
determination as to whether the property can be reasonably sold or yield a
reasonable return to present or future owners.
   (c)   Study Period. If the Commission finds that, without approval of the
proposed work, the property cannot obtain a reasonable economic return
therefrom, then the application shall be delayed for a period not to exceed
forty-five days. During this period of delay, the Commission shall investigate
plans and make recommendations to the Council to allow for a reasonably
beneficial use or a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the
subject property. Such plans and recommendations may include, without
limitation, the following: a relaxation of the provisions of this title, a
reduction in real property taxes, financial assistance, building code
modifications, and/or changes in zoning regulations.
   (d)   Decision. If, by the end of this forty-five-day period, the Commission
has found that without approval of the proposed work the property cannot be put
to a reasonable beneficial use, or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable
economic return therefrom, then the Commission shall issue a Certificate of
Economic Hardship approving the proposed work. If the Commission finds
otherwise, then it shall deny the application for a Certificate of Economic
Hardship.
   (e)   Appeal. When a Certificate of Economic Hardship is denied, the
applicant may appeal the Commission's decision in the same manner provided for
Certificates of Appropriateness, as described in Section
1498.05(e).

1498.07 NATURAL DESTRUCTION OR DEMOLITION.
   In the case of partial or complete natural destruction or demolition of a
landmark, the owner of record shall be required to obtain a Certificate of
Appropriateness from the Commission prior to reconstruction. Although exact
duplication of the previous structure may not be required, the exterior design
of the property shall be in harmony with the exterior design of the structure
prior to damage.
(Ord. 2005-01. Passed 1-10-05.)

Appropriateness shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof
shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more
