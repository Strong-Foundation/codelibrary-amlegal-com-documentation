ADMINISTRATION
ARTICLE I – GENERAL CODE PROVISIONS
DIVISION I - TITLE
1-1-1 TITLE.
   Upon the adoption by the Village Board of Trustees, this Village Code is
hereby declared to be and shall hereafter constitute the official “Revised Code
of Ordinances of the Village of Hamel”. The Revised Code of Ordinances shall be
known and cited as the “Village Code”, and it is hereby published by authority
of the Village Board and shall be kept up-to-date as provided in Section
1-1-3 under the direction of the Village Attorney, acting for said Village
Board. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be
understood to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate chapter
and article heading and to the general penalty clause relating thereto as well
as to the section itself when reference is made to this Village Code by title
in any legal document. (See 65 ILCS Sec. 5/1-2-3)
1-1-2 ACCEPTANCE.
   The Village Code as hereby presented in printed form shall hereafter be
received without further proof in all courts and in all administrative
tribunals of this State as the ordinances of the Village of general and
permanent effect, except the excluded ordinances enumerated in Section
1-1-8. (See 65 ILCS Sec. 5/1-2-6)
1-1-3 AMENDMENTS.
   Any ordinance amending this Village Code shall set forth the article,
chapter, and section number of the section or sections to be amended, and this
shall constitute a sufficient compliance with any statutory requirement
pertaining to the amendment or revision by ordinance of any part of this
Village Code. All such amendments or revisions by ordinance shall be forwarded
to the codifiers on an annual basis and the ordinance material shall be
prepared for insertion in its proper place in each copy of this Village Code.
Each such replacement page shall be properly identified and shall be inserted
in each individual copy of the Village Code on an annual basis. (See 65 ILCS
Sec. 5/1-2-3)
1-1-4 CODE ALTERATION.
   It shall be deemed unlawful for any person to alter, change, replace or
deface in any way, any section or any page of this Code in such a manner that
the meaning of any phrase or order may be changed or omitted. Replacement pages
may be inserted according to the official instructions when so authorized by
the Village Board. The Clerk shall see that the replacement pages are properly
inserted in the official copies maintained in the office of the Clerk.
   Any person having in his custody an official copy of this Code shall make
every effort to maintain said Code in an up-to-date and efficient manner. He
shall see to the immediate insertion of new or replacement pages when such are
delivered to him or made available to him through the office of the Village
Clerk. Said Code books, while in actual possession of officials and other
interested persons, shall be and remain the property of the Village and shall
be returned to the office of the Clerk upon termination of office or separation
of duties.
1-1-5 JURISDICTION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, this Code applies to acts performed within
the corporate limits of the Village. Provisions of this Code also apply to acts
performed outside the corporate limits and up to the limits prescribed by law,
where the law confers power on the Village to regulate such particular acts
outside the corporate limits.
1-1-6 - 1-1-7 RESERVED.
DIVISION II - SAVING CLAUSE
1-1-8 REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES.
   All general ordinances of the Village passed prior to the adoption of this
Code are hereby repealed, except such as are referred to herein as being still
in force or are, by necessary implication, herein reserved from repeal [subject
to the saving clauses contained in the following sections], from which are
excluded the following ordinances, which are not hereby repealed:
   Tax Levy Ordinances; Appropriation Ordinances; Ordinances Relating to
Boundaries and Annexations; Franchise Ordinances and other Ordinances Granting
Special Rights to Persons or Corporations; Contract Ordinances and Ordinances
Authorizing the Execution of a Contract or the Issuance of Warrants; Ordinances
Establishing, Naming, or Vacating Streets, Alleys, or Other Public Places;
Improvement Ordinances; Bond Ordinances; Ordinances Relating to Elections;
Ordinances Relating to the Transfer or Acceptance of Real Estate by or from the
Village; and all Special Ordinances.
1-1-9 PUBLIC UTILITY ORDINANCES.
   No ordinance relating to railroads or railroad crossings with streets and
other public ways or relating to the conduct, duties, service or rates of
public utilities shall be repealed by virtue of the adoption of this Code or by
virtue of the preceding section, excepting as this Code shall be considered as
amending such ordinance or ordinances in respect to such provisions only.
1-1-10 COURT PROCEEDINGS.
   No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance,
whether such former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense
committed against such former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued or claim arising
under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect any claim arising
under the former ordinance or in any way whatever to affect any such offense or
act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so
incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance takes
effect, save only that the proceedings thereafter shall conform to the
ordinance in force at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If
any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new
ordinance, such provision may be, by the consent of the party affected, applied
to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect.
   This Section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or
implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions
upon the same subject or in any other ordinance.
   Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be construed as abating any action
now pending under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the Village herein
repealed and the provisions of all general ordinances contained in this Code
shall be deemed to be continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same
provision; nor shall this Chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating,
modifying or altering any penalty accrued or to accrue, or as affecting the
liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving any right of the
Village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of the
adoption of this Code.
1-1-11 SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS.
   Each section, paragraph, sentence, clause and provision of this Code is
severable, and if any provision is held unconstitutional or invalid for any
reason, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this Code, nor any part
thereof, other than that part affected by such decision.
1-1-12 VILLAGE CLERK’S CERTIFICATE.
   The Village Clerk's Certificate shall be substantially in the following

elected.

the table, provided two-thirds (2/3) of the Trustees vote therefor.

accepted by the Trustees by a vote shall entirely supersede such original
proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments
appertaining thereto.
   (Y)   Reconsideration. A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time
during the same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A

   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by Trustees who voted on
the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless otherwise
provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a majority
vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground that a
greater number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or
adoption of such motion, then in such case, a motion to reconsider may be made
and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be
reconsidered.

   (A)    Attorney. It shall be the duty of the Village Attorney to prepare
such ordinances as may be required by the Village Board.

   When a proposed ordinance is introduced, it shall be read one time by title
only and referred to the proper committee unless the Board of Trustees shall
otherwise specifically direct.
   (C)   Vote required-Yeas and Nays Record.
   The passage of all ordinances for whatever purpose, and of any resolution or
motion (1) to create any liability against a Village or (2) for the expenditure
or appropriation of its money, shall require the concurrence of a majority of
all members then holding office on the Village Board, including the Mayor,
unless otherwise expressly provided by the Code or any other act governing the
passage of any ordinance, resolution, or motion; provided that, where the Board
consists of an odd number of Trustees, the vote of the majority of the trustees
shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance. The yeas and nays shall be taken upon
the question of the passage of the designated ordinances, resolutions, or
motions and recorded in the journal of the Village Board. In addition, the
corporate authorities at any meeting may by unanimous consent to take a single
vote by yeas or nays on the several questions of the passage on any two (2) or
more of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions or motions placed
together for voting purposes in a single group. The single vote shall be
entered separately in the journal under the designation "omnibus vote", and in
such event the Clerk may enter the words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in
the journal in each case in lieu of entering names of the members of Village
Board voting "yea" and of those voting "nay" on the passage of each of the
designated ordinances, orders, resolutions and motions included in such omnibus
group or consent agenda. The taking of such single or omnibus vote and such
entries of the words "omnibus vote" or "consent agenda" in the journal shall be
a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this Section to all intents
and purposes and with like effect as if the vote in each case had been
separately by yeas and nays on the question of the passage of each ordinance,
order, resolution and motion included in such omnibus group, and separately
recorded in the journal. Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be taken upon the
question of the passage of any other resolution or motion at the request of any

ordinance or resolution, the Mayor shall sign it. Those ordinances, resolutions
and motions which the Mayor disapproves shall be returned to the Village Board,
with the Mayor’s written objections, at the next regular meeting of the Village
Board occurring not less than five (5) days after their passage. The Mayor may
disapprove of any one (1) or more sums appropriated in any ordinance,
resolution, or motion making an appropriation, and, if so, the remainder shall

written objection. If, after reconsideration, two-thirds (2/3) of all the

to pass an ordinance, resolution, or motion, notwithstanding the Mayor's
refusal to approve it, then it shall be effective. The vote on the question of
passage over the Mayor's veto shall be by yeas and nays, and shall be recorded
in the journal. (See 65 ILCS Sec. 5/3.1-40-50)

permanent physical or mental disability, that person is removed from the office
and the vacancy of the office occurs on the date of the determination.
1-2-43 VACANCY BY OTHER CAUSES.
   (A)   Abandonment and Other Causes. A vacancy occurs in an office by reason
of abandonment of office; removal from office; or failure to qualify; or more
than temporary removal of residence from the Municipality, as the case may be.
The corporate authorities have the authority to determine whether a vacancy
under this Section has occurred. If the corporate authorities determine that a
vacancy exists, the office is deemed vacant as of the date of that
determination for all purposes including the calculation under Sections 1-2-45
or 1-2-46.
   (B)   Guilty of a Criminal Offense.
   An admission of guilt of a criminal offense that upon conviction would
disqualify the municipal officer from holding the office, in the form of a
written agreement with State or federal prosecutors to plead guilty to a
felony, bribery, perjury, or other infamous crime under State or federal law,
constitutes a resignation from that office, effective on the date the plea
agreement is made. For purposes of this Section, a conviction for an offense
that disqualifies a municipal officer from holding that office occurs on the
date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in the case of a trial by the court,
on the entry of a finding of guilt.
   (C)   Election Declared Void. A vacancy occurs on the date of the decision
of a competent tribunal declaring the election of the officer void.
1-2-44 ELECTION OF AN ACTING MAYOR.
   The election of an acting Mayor pursuant to Section
1-2-46 or
1-2-47 does not create a vacancy in the original office of the person on the
Village Board, unless the person resigns from the original office following
election as acting Mayor. If the person resigns from the original office
following election as acting Mayor, then the original office must be filled
pursuant to the terms of this Section and the acting Mayor shall exercise the
powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the manner provided
by law for a Mayor. If the person does not resign from the original office
following election as acting Mayor, then the acting Mayor shall exercise the
powers of the Mayor but shall be entitled to vote only in the manner provided
for as the holder of the original office and shall not have the power to veto.
If the person does not resign from the original office following election as
acting Mayor, and if that person’s original term of office has not expired when
a Mayor is elected and has qualified for office, the acting Mayor shall return
to the original office for the remainder of the term thereof.
1-2-45 APPOINTMENT TO FILL TRUSTEE VACANCY.
   An appointment by the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, of a
qualified person as described in Section
1-2-23 of this Code to fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee must be made
within sixty (60) days after the vacancy occurs. Once the appointment of the
qualified person has been forwarded to the corporate authorities, the corporate
authorities shall act upon the appointment within thirty (30) days. If the
appointment fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate
authorities within thirty (30) days, the Mayor or acting Mayor shall appoint
and forward to the corporate authorities a second qualified person as described
in Section
1-2-23. Once the appointment of the second qualified person has been forwarded
to the corporate authorities, the corporate authorities shall act upon the
appointment within thirty (30) days. If the appointment of the second qualified
person also fails to receive the advice and consent of the corporate
authorities, then the Mayor or acting Mayor, without the advice and consent of
the corporate authorities, may make a temporary appointment from those persons
who were appointed but whose appointments failed to receive the advice and
consent of the corporate authorities. The person receiving the temporary
appointment shall serve until an appointment has received the advice and
consent and the appointee has qualified or until a person has been elected and
has qualified, whichever first occurs.
1-2-46 ELECTION TO FILL VACANCIES IN MUNICIPAL OFFICES WITH FOUR (4) YEAR
TERMS.
   If a vacancy occurs in an elective municipal office with a four (4) year
term and there remains an unexpired portion of the term of at least twenty-
eight (28) months, and the vacancy occurs at least one hundred thirty (130)
days before the general municipal election next scheduled under the general
election law, then the vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the term at
that general municipal election. Whenever an election is held for this purpose,
the Village Clerk shall certify the office to be filled and the candidates for
the office to the proper election authorities as provided in the general
election law. If a vacancy occurs with less than twenty-eight (28) months
remaining in the unexpired portion of the term or less than one hundred thirty
(130) days before the general municipal election, then:
   (A)   Mayor.

set forth in Section
1-2-44, the acting Mayor shall perform the duties and possess all the rights
and powers of the Mayor until a Mayor is elected at the next general municipal
election and has qualified. However, in villages with a population of less than
five thousand (5,000), if each of the trustees either declines the election as
acting Mayor or is not elected by a majority vote of the trustees presently
holding office, then the trustees may elect, as acting Mayor, any other Village
resident who is qualified to hold municipal office, and the acting Mayor shall
exercise the powers of the Mayor and shall vote and have veto power in the
manner provided by law for a Mayor.
   (B)   Trustee.
   If the vacancy is in the office of Trustee, the vacancy must be filled by
the Mayor or acting Mayor, as the case may be, in accordance with Section
1-2-45.
   (C)   Other Elective Office.
   If the vacancy is in any elective municipal office other than Mayor or

subject to the advice and consent of the Board of Trustees, as the case may be.

12                      1680
 
Where unusual or safety-threatening conditions exist, the authority having
jurisdiction shall be permitted to increase the required separation distances
as it deems necessary.
[ ]   Spectators and spectator parking areas must be located outside of the
display site.
[ ]   Dwellings, buildings, and structures are not permitted to be located
within the display site without the approval of the authority having
jurisdiction and the owner and the dwelling, building, or structure is
unoccupied during the display. The building may remain occupied if the
structure provides protection through substantial noncombustible or fire-
resistant construction for the occupants.
[ ]   Fire protection personnel and their vehicles and other emergency response
personnel and vehicles shall remain at or beyond the perimeter of the display
site during the actual firing of the display.
[ ]   Review sample Display Site Plan at end of this document.
PART C – LOCATION OF DISPLAY
[ ]   Mortars shall be placed at the approximate center of the display site.
[ ]   There shall not be any overhead object over the mortars or within 25 ft
of the trajectory of any aerial shells.
[ ]   Ground display pieces shall be located a minimum distance of 75 ft from
spectator viewing areas and parking areas.
[ ]   Exception: For ground pieces with greater hazard potential (such as large
wheels with powerful drivers, and items employing large salutes) or all roman
candles and multishot devices, the minimum separation distance shall be
increased to 125 ft (38 m).
PART D - MORTARS
[ ]   Mortars shall be positioned and spaced so that shells are propelled away
from spectators, over the fallout area, and to afford maximum protection to the
shooter and loader. Under no circumstances shall mortars be angled toward the
spectator viewing area.
[ ]   Mortar racks or bundles shall be constructed in a thorough and
workmanlike manner to be capable of holding multiple mortars in position during
normal functioning. Mortar racks or bundles that are not inherently stable
shall be secured or braced to stabilize them. Stabilization shall be
accomplished by using stakes, legs, A-frames, side-boards, or equivalent means.
PART E – GROUND DISPLAY
[ ]   To the extent that it is practical, all ground display pieces shall be
positioned outside the discharge area of aerial displays.
[ ]   Exception: Where aerial shells have been preloaded, ground display pieces
shall be permitted to be located in that discharge area.
[ ]   Dry grass or combustible materials located beneath ground display pieces
shall be wet down before the display if they are in sufficient quantity to be a
fire hazard.
[ ]   Poles for ground display pieces shall be securely placed and firmly
braced so that they do not fall over during functioning of the fireworks
device.
PART F – DISPLAY SITE SAFETY
[ ]   The authority having jurisdiction and the operator shall meet and
determine the level of fire protection required.
[ ]   During the period before the display, where pyrotechnic materials are
present, unescorted public access to the site shall not be permitted.
[ ]   Are there enough monitors positioned around the discharge site to prevent
spectators or any other unauthorized persons from entering the discharge site?
The discharge site must be restricted throughout the display and until the
discharge site has been inspected after the display. The authority having
jurisdiction may approve delineators or barriers to be used in crowd control.
[ ]   Does the display have at least two spotters, or preferably more, assigned
to watch the flight and behavior of aerial shells and other aerial fireworks to
verify that they are functioning as intended. If any unsafe condition is
detected, such as hazardous debris falling into the audience, the spotter shall
signal the shooter to cease firing until the unsafe condition is corrected. The
spotters shall be in direct communication with the shooter during the conduct
of the display, with an effective means of informing the shooter of any
hazardous condition.
PART G – DISCHARGE AREA SAFETY
[ ]   During the firing of the display, all personnel in the discharge site
shall wear head protection, eye protection, hearing protection, and foot
protection and shall wear cotton, wool, or similarly flame-resistant, long-
sleeved, long-legged clothing. Personal protective equipment, as necessary,
shall be worn by the operator and assistants during the setup and cleanup of
the display.
[ ]   No person shall ever place any body part over the mortar during the
loading and firing of a display until mortars have been checked for the absence
of any shells following the display.
[ ]   Smoking materials, matches, lighters or open flame devices shall not be
allowed within 50 ft (15 m) of any area where fireworks or other pyrotechnic
materials are present.
[ ]   Exception: Devices such as fuses, portfires, and torches shall be
permitted to be used to ignite fireworks.
[ ]   No person shall be allowed in the discharge area while under the
influence of alcohol, narcotics, or medication that could adversely affect
judgment, mobility, or stability.
[ ]   The first shell fired shall be observed carefully to determine that its
trajectory is such that the shell functions over the fallout area and that any
hazardous debris or unexploded shells land in the fallout area. The display
shall be interrupted and the mortars shall be reangled or repositioned as
necessary for safety at any time during an outdoor fireworks display.
PART H – HALTING DISPLAY
[ ]   Wherever, in the opinion of the authority having jurisdiction or the
operator, any hazardous condition exists, the fireworks display shall be
postponed until the condition is corrected. Such conditions include but are not
limited to the following:
[ ]   The lack of crowd control,
[ ]   If high winds, precipitation, or other adverse weather conditions
prevail, or
[ ]   If any unsafe condition is detected, such as hazardous debris falling
into the audience, the spotter shall signal the shooter to cease firing until
the unsafe condition is corrected.
[ ]   In the event of a condition arising requiring the entry of fire
protection or other emergency response personnel into the fallout area or
security perimeter, the display shall be halted until the situation is resolved
and the area is once again clear.
PART I – POST DISPLAY INSPECTION
[ ]   Following the display, the firing crew shall conduct an inspection of the
fallout area for the purpose of locating any unexploded aerial shells or live
components. This inspection shall be conducted before any public access to the
site shall be permitted.
[ ]   Where fireworks are displayed at night, a search of the fallout area
shall be made immediately after the display and at first light the following
morning by the operator or designated personnel acceptable to the authority
having jurisdiction.

8-3-3 REGULATION OF SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Permitted Use.
   Except as otherwise provided in Section
8-3-3(C)(9) below (regarding Height Exceptions or Variances), small wireless
facilities are hereby classified as permitted uses, subject only to
administrative review, and not subject to zoning review or approval, if they
are collocated (i) in rights-of-way in any zoning district, or (ii) outside
rights-of-way in property zoned exclusively for commercial or industrial use,
notwithstanding any statement to the contrary in any other ordinance adopted by
the Village.
   (B)   Permit Required.
   An applicant shall obtain one or more permits from the Village to collocate
a small wireless facility. An application shall be received and processed, and
permits issued shall be subject to the following conditions and requirements:
      (1)   Application Requirements. A wireless provider shall provide the
following information to the Village, together with the Village’s Small Cell
Facilities Permit Application, as a condition of any permit application to
collocate small wireless facilities on a utility pole or wireless support
structure:
         (a)   Site specific structural integrity and, for a municipal utility
pole, make-ready analysis prepared by a structural engineer, as that term is
defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act of 1989, as
such act may be amended from time to time (the “SEPA”);
         (b)   The location where each proposed small wireless facility or
utility pole would be installed and photographs of the location and its
immediate surroundings depicting the utility poles or structures on which each
proposed small wireless facility would be mounted or location where utility
poles or structures would be installed. This should include a depiction of the
completed facility in that location;
         (c)   Specifications and drawings prepared by a structural engineer,
as that term is defined in Section 4 of the SEPA, for each proposed small
wireless facility covered by the application as it is proposed to be installed;
         (d)   The equipment type and model numbers for the antennas and all
other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility;
         (e)   A proposed schedule for the installation and completion of each
small wireless facility covered by the application, if approved; and
         (f)   Certification that the collocation complies with the Collocation
Requirements and Conditions contained herein, to the best of the applicant’s
knowledge. For purposes of this Section, the applicant’s knowledge includes not
only the knowledge of the person signing the certification but, also, the
knowledge of all officers of the applicant and of each employee or agent of the
applicant involved with the proposed small wireless facility.
         (g)   In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be
attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the Village, the
wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of
the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
      (2)   Application Process.
   The Village shall process applications as follows:
         (a)   The first completed application shall have priority over
applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same
utility pole or wireless support structure.
         (b)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the Village fails to
approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days after the submission of
a completed application.
   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a
deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village, in writing, of
its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than seventy-five
(75) days after the submission of a completed application; and prior to the
ninetieth (90th) day after the submission of the completed application.
   Unless otherwise approved or rejected by the Village within ninety (90) days
after submission of the completed application, the permit shall be deemed
approved on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day after submission of the
complete application or the tenth (10th) day after the receipt of the deemed
approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall
not preclude the Village’s denial of the permit request within the time limits
as provided under this Article.
         (c)   An application to collocate a small wireless facility that
includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the Village fails to approve or
deny the application within one hundred twenty (120) days after the submission
of a completed application.
   However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a
deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the Village in writing of its
intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than one hundred five
(105) days after the submission of a completed application; and prior to the
one hundred twentieth (120th) day after the submission of the completed
application.
   Unless otherwise approved or rejected by the Village within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the submission of the completed application, the permit
shall be deemed approved on the later of the one hundred twentieth (120th) day
after submission of the complete application or the tenth (10th) day after the
receipt of the deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed
approved notice shall not preclude the Village’s denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this Article.
         (d)   The Village may, on a non-discriminatory basis, deny an
application which does not meet the requirements of this Article.
   If the Village determines that applicable codes, ordinances, or regulations
that concern public safety, or the Collocation Requirements and Conditions
contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support structure be
replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the
replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of
the applicant and/or the wireless provider.
   The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific
code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies
an application.
   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and
resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of
denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee.
The Village shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30)
days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial
shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees,
and recommencement of the Village’s review period. The application shall be
reviewed after completed applications that have been submitted before it.
   The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to proceed
with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis (if denial is not
received within thirty (30) days after submission of the revised application),
which notification may be submitted with the revised application.
   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies
cited in the denial (so long as other provisions of the application have not
been changed). However, this limitation does not apply if the cure requires the
review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new
antennas, or other new or different wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole Attachment Agreement.
   Within thirty (30) days after an approved permit to collocate a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant
shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment Agreement, in the form provided by
the Village, for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by such
approved application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the Village and the applicant
shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
      (3)   Completeness of Application.
   Within thirty (30) days after receiving an application, the Village shall
determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an
application is incomplete, the Village must specifically identify the missing
information. An application shall be deemed complete if the Village fails to
provide notification to the applicant within thirty (30) days after all
documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the Village’s permit
application form are submitted by the applicant to the Village.
   Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the Village sends the notice
of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      (4)   Tolling.
   The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         (b)   A local, State, or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      (5)   Consolidated Applications.
   An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the
jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at the applicant’s discretion, to
file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation
of up to twenty-five (25) small wireless facilities, if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village
may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of Permits.
   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five (5)
years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or
modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village codes or any
provision, condition, or requirement contained in this Article.
   If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of
permits shall be subject to the applicable Village code provisions or
regulations in effect at the time of renewal.
      (7)   Means of Submitting Applications.
   Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information, and notices to
the Village by personal delivery at the Village’s designated place of business,
by regular mail postmarked on the date due, or by any other commonly used
means, including electronic mail, by which the application is received by the
Village no later than the date due.
   (C)   Collocation Requirements and Conditions.
      (1)   Public Safety Space Reservation.
   The Village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public
safety uses, for the Village’s electric utility uses, or both, but a
reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless
facility unless the Village reasonably determines that the municipal utility
pole cannot accommodate both (or all three) uses.
      (2)   Installation and Maintenance.
   The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small
wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with
the requirements and conditions of this Article. The wireless provider shall
ensure that its employees, agents, and/or contractors that perform work in
connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and
skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards,
laws, and regulations.
      (3)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies.
   The wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
   A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency’s communications equipment.
   Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance
with industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
   The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on
such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code
of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph (or the then applicable
regulations). Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall
constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving such space and/or the top of
the pole.
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “communications space”,
“communication worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, as amended from time
to time.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, and reasonable
stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in any
Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, the Village’s
comprehensive plan, and any other written design plan that applies to other
occupiers of the rights-of-way, including those applicable to historic
landmarks and/or historic districts.
      (7)   Alternate Placements.
   Except as provided in this Collocation Requirements and Conditions Section,
a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless
facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be
required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole.
However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless
facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the
small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification to the Village describing the
property rights, technical limits, or material cost reasons the alternate
location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (8)   Height Limitations.
   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten
(10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the
small wireless facility is collocated.
   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
         (b)   forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height Exceptions or Variances.
   If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of
the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed
for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variance in conformance with
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the Village’s Zoning Code as set
forth in the Hamel Revised Code of Ordinances.
      (10)   Contractual Design Requirements.
   The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a
contract between the Village and a private property owner that concern design
or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted
equipment located in the right-of-way.
      (11)   Ground-mounted Equipment Spacing.
   The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in
applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted
equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver,
zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception
or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances.
      (12)   Undergrounding Regulations.
   The wireless provider shall comply with all local code provisions or
regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the
installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-
of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or
other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or
modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of
utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation Completion Deadline.
   Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the Village and
the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-
ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or
backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a
timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for
commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete
installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of
the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void, unless the Village grants an
extension in writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application Fees.
   Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of Six Hundred Fifty Dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and Three Hundred Fifty
Dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      (2)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   routine maintenance;
         (b)   the replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with (d) under the Section titled Application
Requirements; or
         (c)   the installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles, so long as such installation, placement,
maintenance, operation, or replacement is in compliance with all applicable
safety codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to Applicability.
   Nothing in this Article authorizes a person to collocate small wireless
facilities on:
      (1)   property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   property owned, leased, or controlled by a part district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes, without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, any public commuter rail service, or an electric
utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the
consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility.
The provisions of this Article do not apply to an electric or gas public
utility or such utility’s wireless facilities if the facilities are being used,
developed, and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of
Section 16108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
   For the purposes of this subsection, “public utility” has the meaning given
to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this
Article shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to
obtain a franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or
video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place,
maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless
facilities subject to this Article.
   (F)   Pre-Existing Agreements.
   Existing agreements between the Village and wireless providers that relate
to the collection of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including
the collocation of small wireless facilities on Village utility poles, that are
in effect on June 1, 2018, if any, remain in effect for all small wireless
facilities collocated on the Village’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination
provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into after June 1, 2018, shall
comply with this Article.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a wireless provider that has an existing
agreement with the Village on the effective date of the Act may opt, instead,
to accept the rates, fees, and terms that the Village makes available under
this Article for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the
installation of new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless
facilities by submitting a completed application for such small wireless
facilities no sooner than two (2) years after the effective date of the Act,
along with a notification to the Village that the wireless provider opts to
accept the rates, fees, and terms hereunder, rather than under its existing
agreement. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable
termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider
has collocated on the Village’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the Village before the wireless provider provides such notice and
exercise its option under this paragraph.
   (G)   Annual Recurring Rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) Two Hundred Dollars
($200.00) per year or (ii) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to
the wireless provider’s use of space on the Village utility pole.
   If the Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs,
the fee shall be Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after
the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent
to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. If the Village
has billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs prior to such annual
anniversary, the fee shall be such actual and direct costs; and shall be paid
(i) no later than the annual anniversary date, or (ii) within ten (10) business
days after the Village has provided such actual and direct costs to the
wireless provider, whichever is later.
   (H)   Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the
wireless provider of the abandonment.
   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety
(90) days of such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such
facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal
utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of
nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery, and charge the
wireless provider for all costs incurred in such removal.
   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if it sells
or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village.
Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider.
8-3-4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Madison County, Illinois shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless
Facilities Deployment Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for
collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the
right-of-way, the Village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on
its poles at annual rates of no more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per
year per municipal utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final
resolution of the dispute.
8-3-5 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this Article and/or the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
8-3-6 INSURANCE.
   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   (A)   property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
   (B)   workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
   (C)   commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection
limits consistent with its requirements of other users of Village improvements
or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
   The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured on
the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and
documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirement required by the Village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this
Section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage limits required by the Village.

   The Company’s system shall be primarily underground, however, the Company
may upon approval from the Municipality use the poles or the suspension
facilities of the utility companies serving the Municipality. Where necessary
to construct the system beneath existing pavement surfaces, the Company shall
make its best effort to bore beneath such surfaces so as not to in any means
disrupt or disturb them from their existing condition. Should it be necessary
to disturb any existing pavement surface, the Company shall, at its own expense
and effort, properly backfill any excavation and restore the surface of the
pavement to a condition reasonably equal to that which existed prior to such
excavation and to subsequently correct, by additional backfilling or
restoration, any sinking or settlement of such excavation or deterioration of
such surfaces, except that which might occur during the normal course of wear
and tear. The Company, when placing its distribution facilities in areas
excluding surface pavement, shall make every effort to construct in a manner
which will provide the least disruption to the prior existing surface condition
of that area. Should trenching be necessary, the Company shall backfill and
restore the surface of the ground to a condition reasonably equal to the
condition prior to such trenching, including reseeding or sodding as the
specific situation requires.
Section 4. Right of Way Occupancy.   
   (A)   Use.
   The Company’s transmission and distribution system, wires and appurtenances
shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere
with the lives of persons, or to interfere with the improvements the
Municipality may deem proper to make, or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct
the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges or other public property.
   (B)   Restoration.
   In case of the disturbance of any pavement, sidewalk, driveway or other
surfacing, the Company shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner
approved by the Municipality’s Authorized Agent, replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway or surface of any street or alley disturbed in as
good a condition as before said work was commenced.
   (C)   Location.
   In the event that at any time during the period of this Agreement the
Municipality shall by reason of the construction of public facilities, traffic
conditions, public safety or street vacation, or the Municipality shall
lawfully elect to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or public way,
requiring the moving or relocation of any of the facilities of the Company, the
Company, upon reasonable notice by the Municipality, shall remove and relocate
its wires, cables, underground conduits and other fixtures at its own expense.
   (D)   If the company seeks to construct and maintain its electronic
communications system within public or private property, and an easement for
such use has already been granted to a telephone company, electric or other
public utility, said easement shall be interpreted so as to grant the Company
the same rights and privileges as have been granted to the telephone company
and electric or other public utility. In such easements the words “telephone”
or “telephone company,” “electric company,” “public utility” and the like shall
be interpreted to provide equal access by the Company. The Company shall not be
required to construct its facilities and provide service to areas where
required easements are not reasonably obtainable.
Section 5. Codes.
   All construction of the Company, including installation and maintenance of
its transmission and distribution system, shall be in accordance with the

filed in the Office of the Municipal Clerk a statement duly executed reciting
the fact of such sale, assignment or lease accepting the terms of the Agreement
and agreeing to perform all the conditions thereof. Upon receipt of said notice
from the Company, the Municipality reserves the right within the 30 day period
to exercise its authority as provided by federal law in these matters. However,
nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the company from assigning this
Agreement as security collateral for the purpose of obtaining financing.
Section 7. Indemnification and Insurance.

all liability, damage or expense arising from accidental or negligent damage
either to itself or other persons or property of others which may occur by the
reasons of the Company’s activities and shall provide the following:
   (A)   The Company shall at all times during the term of this Agreement

of the service.
To the extent that Federal or State Law or regulation may now, or as the same
may hereafter be amended to, authorize the City/County to regulate the rates
for any particular service tiers, service packages, equipment, or any other
services provided by the Franchisee, the County shall have the right to
exercise rate regulation to the full extent authorized by law, or to refrain
from exercising such regulation for any period of time, at the sole discretion
of the City/County. If and when exercising rate regulation, the County shall
abide by the terms and conditions set forth by the FCC.

CHAPTER 11
EMPLOYEE POLICIES
ARTICLE I – INFORMATION FOR NEW EMPLOYEES
11-1-1 VILLAGE OF HAMEL INTRODUCTION.
   Whether you have just joined our staff or have been with the Village for a
while, we are confident that you will find the Village a dynamic and rewarding
place in which to work, and we look forward to a productive and successful
association. We consider the employees of the Village of Hamel to be one of its
most valuable resources. This Handbook has been written to serve as the guide
for the Village/employee relationship.
   No employee handbook can answer every question or anticipate every
situation. For that reason, the Village Board may interpret, change,
supplement, or rescind any part of this Handbook or any of its other policies
from as it deems appropriate, with or without prior notice. This Handbook
supersedes any earlier policy statements concerning the matters described in
this Handbook or any oral statements made at any time during your employment.
Nothing in this Handbook or in any of the Village's policies, practices, or
representations to or about its employees is an express or implied contract.
Your employment is not for any specific time and may be terminated at will,
with or without cause, and without any prior notice by the Village. You may
also resign for any reason at any time. No supervisor or representative of the
Village has the authority to enter into any agreement for employment for any
specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to the above. The
only person that has the authority to enter into a written agreement with an
employee is the Village President. If you have a written employment agreement
signed by the Village President and a statement in this Handbook conflicts with
the terms of that employment agreement, the terms of the employee agreement
govern.
   The procedure, practices, policies and benefits described here may be
modified and discontinued from time to time. We will try to inform you of any
changes that may occur.
11-1-2 SCOPE.  
   This Employee Handbook applies to all regular and full-time employees, as
well as, seasonal/temporary employees who work for the Village of Hamel, with
the exception of employees employed by the police department. The Village of
Hamel will mention from time to time when a policy or practice may be slightly
different for employees who are working under contract terms. Whenever the
policies, terms, conditions or language of this Handbook are in conflict with a
contract, the policies, terms, conditions and language of the contract
supersede those of the Handbook.
11-1-3 ADOPTION AND POLICY AMENDMENT.  
   These policies and procedures are adopted by resolution of the Village
Board. Policy amendments shall become effective upon consideration and adoption
by the Village Board.
11-1-4 EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL AND DISCLAIMER.  
   The contents of this Handbook are presented as a matter of information only.
This Handbook does not, either by itself or in conjunction with any other
Village documents policy, procedure action, practice or verbal statement
creating an employment contract, express or implied. The Village of Hamel
reserves the right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate, or change any or all
procedures contained herein in whole or in part at any time with or without
prior notice.
   All employees are employed "at-will" and can be terminated at any time with
or without cause without prior notice, except as otherwise provided by law. No
employee has any authority to modify the "at-will" status of any employee
unless that modification is expressly made in writing and has been specifically
agreed to in writing by the Village Board.
11-1-5 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.  
   The Village of Hamel affirms its commitment to providing Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) for all employees and applicants of the Village. No personnel
decision or action shall be unlawfully influenced in any manner by
consideration of an individual's race, color, religion, creed, national origin,
ancestry, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, gender
identity, genetic information, or status as a covered veteran or any other
characteristic protected under applicable federal, state, or local law.
   The Village of Hamel expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee
harassment based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, marital status, gender
identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, genetic information,
disability, veteran status, or any other protected characteristic. Improper
interference with the ability of the Village of Hamel employees to perform
their expected job duties is absolutely not tolerated.
11-1-6 EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES.  
   All employees are designated as either non-exempt or exempt under state and
federal wage and hour laws. The following is intended to help employees
understand employment classifications and employment status. These
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time.
The right to terminate the employment-at-will relationship at any time is
retained by both the employee and the Village of Hamel.
   Non-exempt employees - are employees whose work is covered by the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA). They are NOT exempt from the law's requirements
concerning minimum wage and overtime.
   Exempt employees - are generally managers or professional, administrative or
technical staff who ARE exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of
the FLSA. Exempt employees hold jobs that meet the standards and criteria
established under the FLSA by the U.S. Department of Labor.
11-1-7 PROBATIONARY PERIOD.  
   The first six (6) months of employment are a time for the Village and the
employee to get to know one another. If during the probationary period it is
determined that the employee does not fulfill the requirements of his/her
employment or if the Village determines that continued employment is not in the
interest of the Village, the employee will be terminated.
   Following a break or breaks in service totaling more than two (2) weeks, a
regular employee's probationary period shall be extended by a period equal to
the break in service.
   Prior to the end of the probationary period, the supervisor shall complete a
written performance evaluation for the employee. Continuance in the position
after expiration of the probationary period shall constitute regular
employment. However, completion of the probationary period does not alter the
at-will status of the employment relationship.
11-1-8 BACKGROUND AND REFERENCE CHECKS.  
   To ensure that individuals who join the Village of Hamel are well qualified
and to ensure that the Village of Hamel maintains a safe and productive work
environment, it is the Village's policy to conduct pre-employment background
checks on all applicants who accept an offer of employment.
   All offers of employment are conditioned on receipt of a background check
report that is acceptable to the Village. All background checks are conducted
in conformity with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and all other applicable
state and federal laws. Reports are kept confidential and are only viewed by
individuals involved in the hiring process.
   If information obtained in a background check may lead the Village to
question whether to deny employment on the basis of the report, a copy of the
report will be provided to the applicant, and the applicant will have the
opportunity to dispute the report prior to any decision being made as to
whether to deny employment on the basis of the report.
   At any time during employment, additional checks, such as driving record or
credit report, may be made if appropriate and job related.
11-1-9 EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES.  
   The Village of Hamel wants to ensure that Village practices do not create
conflict of interest or favoritism. This extends to practices that involve
employee hiring, promotion and transfer. Close relatives, partners, those in a
dating relationship, and members of the same household are not permitted to be
in positions that have a reporting responsibility to each other.
ARTICLE II – RULES AND STANDARDS
   In order to ensure that all employees are properly paid, the Village has
established the following timekeeping and pay policies. Violations of these
policies may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
11-2-1 WORKING HOURS, LUNCH BREAK AND TIME KEEPING.  
   The Village of Hamel keeps regular business hours Monday through Friday. The
standard full-time schedule for non-exempt employees is eight (8) hours per
business day. Extra work hours may be required to finish specific projects.
Compensation of overtime hours worked will be made in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
   The lunch break is thirty (30) minutes and is included in hours worked. In
addition to the lunch break, all employees are permitted two (2) ten (10)-
minute rest breaks or coffee breaks during a full day of work, to be taken no
less than two (2) hours apart.
   (A)      Maintaining Time Sheets. All employees required to maintain time
sheets are responsible for accurately and honestly recording their hours
worked. Falsifying a time sheet is a violation of Village policy. The Village
prohibits supervisors from directing employees to report less than all hours
worked, i.e., to work "off the clock."
   (B)      Overtime. From time to time, non-exempt employees may be required
to work overtime, for which they will receive overtime pay or comp time in
accordance with applicable wage and hour laws. Employees who work more than a
forty (40) hour work week, shall be compensated one and one-half (1½) times the
basic straight time wage for all time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per
week or receive one and one-half (1½) hours comp time for every hour of
overtime worked, not to exceed a total of twenty (20) cumulative hours.
   In calculating the hours worked for overtime purposes, the following is
included in hours worked: vacation, holidays, approved paid sick days and jury
duty.
   Except in unforeseen and emergency situations, employees should not work
overtime without prior approval from their supervisors. All overtime worked
must be reported, whether it is pre-approved or not pre-approved.
   (C)      Procedure for Pay Discrepancies. Although the Village makes every
effort to ensure that employees are properly paid, all employees should review
their paycheck stub to confirm that they have been paid the correct amount,
received all overtime pay due, and not been subject to improper deductions. If
an employee believes that he or she has not been paid the proper amount or has
been instructed to falsify a time sheet, the employee should promptly report
the matter to the Mayor or Village Clerk, so the matter can be investigated or
reviewed and any necessary corrective action taken. No employee will be subject
to retaliation because he or she makes such a report in good faith.
(Ord. No. 23-022; 12-12-23)
11-2-2 ATTENDANCE.  
   The Village depends on employees to come to work each day, to arrive on
time, and not to leave work earlier than scheduled. Employees should telephone
the Village Clerk's Office and their supervisor to notify of an unexpected
absence. Absences should be reported no later than 7:30 a.m., the day of the
absence. Absent prior authorization from the Mayor or the employee's
supervisor, an emergency, or an approved absence such as a prearranged vacation
day or leave of absence, employees are expected to work every day scheduled.
Excessive absenteeism, tardiness, or leaving work early, or a suspicious
pattern of such conduct, may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination.
11-2-3 EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION.  
   The Village is committed to ensuring that its employees have access to, and
are provided with relevant information about their job. We aim to keep you
informed about what is happening within to explain the decisions that have been
taken and to listen to your views and ideas. We endeavor to communicate openly
and honestly and to be clear, simple and jargon free.
   The supervisors operate an 'open door' policy according to which employees
are free to discuss their ideas for the Village or any concerns they may have.
We realize that the best ideas for continued improvement and problem solving
come from those who are closest to the challenges.
11-2-4 POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT.  
   Positive working relationships are essential to the teamwork that is
necessary to ensure effective delivery of Village service and the well-being of
all employees. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional,
civil, and courteous manner whether interacting with the public or with fellow
employees. Behaviors which tend to create a hostile environment are prohibited.
These include, but are not limited to, rudeness or discourtesy, malicious
gossip, false allegations or providing false information about an employee,
refusal to communicate, including deliberate failure to share necessary job-
related information, and avoidance or "shunning."
11-2-5 DRESS AND APPEARANCE.  
The Village permits business casual and appropriate casual clothing to be worn
in the office. You are expected to report to work well groomed, clean, and
dressed according to the requirements of your position. When in doubt whether a
particular style or type of dress is appropriate, ask your supervisor.
   Full-time employees will have a Four Hundred Dollar ($400.00) clothing
allowance, per year.
11-2-6    PERSONAL PROPERTY.  
   No liability is accepted for loss or damage to any personal property brought
onto Village premises. Employees are requested not to bring personal items of
value into the workplace. Personal items should not be left at the premises
overnight.
11-2-7 PERSONAL DATA.  
   Personal data is any information, whether held on a computer system or in an
organized paper-based filing system which, either on its own or in conjunction
with other information held about you, enables the Village to identify you. The
types of personal data Village will collect about you during your employment
may include any or all of the following: name and address; contact details;
next of kin details; date of birth; education and qualifications; bank account
details; salary information; performance reviews; sickness records, training
records and personal development plans.
   We have systems in place to ensure your personal data is stored securely and
dealt with and processed in accordance with recognized good practice.
   The Village may disclose your personal data to reputable third parties in
order to carry out the normal management and administration processes
associated with your employment. However, the Village will not disclose or
share your personal data to third parties without your permission, unless this
is necessary for the purposes of your employment or is required by law.
11-2-8    CHANGES IN PERSONAL DETAILS.  
   Please ensure that you promptly notify a supervisor of any change of
address, marital status, next of kin details, etc., in order that we can
maintain accurate information and make contact with you in an emergency, if
necessary, outside of normal business hours.
11-2-9 ANTI-HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION.  
   The Village of Hamel is committed to a work environment in which all
individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right
to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment
opportunities and prohibits unlawful discriminatory practices, including
harassment. Therefore, the Village of Hamel expects that all relationships
among persons in the workplace will be business-like and free of bias,
prejudice and harassment.
   The Village encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of
discrimination or harassment. It is the policy of the Village to ensure equal
employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment, on the basis of
race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,
national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, status
as a covered veteran, or any other legally protected characteristic. The
Village prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination
or harassment or who participates in an investigation of such reports.
   The prohibitions contained in this policy include all conduct and
communication regardless of the form of that conduct or communication. This
means that all forms of electronic communication, all types of social media,
and all forms of interaction are covered.
   (A)   Definitions of Harassment. Sexual harassment constitutes
discrimination and is illegal under federal, state and local laws. For the
purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined, as unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors and other written, verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature when; a) submission to such a conduct is made either
explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; b)
submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the
basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; c) such conduct has
the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work
performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
environment. Sexual harassment may include a range of subtle and not-so-subtle
behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender.
Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may include unwanted sexual
advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes and innuendo; verbal abuse
of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual's body, sexual prowess or
sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching; insulting or obscene
comment or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects or
pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of sexual nature.
   Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also
strictly prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal, written or
physical conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual because of his/her race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual
orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship,
genetic information or any other characteristic protected by law or that of
his/her relatives, friends or associates, and that a) has the purpose or effect
of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; b) has the
purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work
performance; or c) otherwise adversely affects an individual's employment
opportunities.
   Harassing conduct includes epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping;
threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written
graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual or group and, whether is placed on walls or displayed elsewhere on
the employer's premises or otherwise circulated in the workplace, on Village
time or using Village equipment via email, phone (including voice messages),
text messages, tweets, blogs, social networking sites or other means.
   The Village prohibits all forms of sexual or other harassment and
discrimination whether involving a single incident or continued harassing
behavior, and whether or not the inappropriate behavior in question rises to
the level of actionable legal harassment or discrimination. Any reported
allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated
promptly. Refer to Codebook Ordinance, 18-019; Policy Prohibiting Sexual
Harassment for the Village of Hamel, Illinois. All employees and committee
personal will be required to complete a State Mandatory Sexual Harassment
Course each year. Certificate of completion will be place in each personal
file.
   (B)   Retaliation. No one will be subject to, and the Village strictly
prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for
good faith reporting of incidents of harassment, discrimination or retaliation
of any kind, pursuing any such claim, or cooperating in related investigations.
   Any employee, regardless of position or title, whom the Village determines
has subjected an individual to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in
violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including
termination of employment.
   Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to
the extent consistent with adequate investigation and corrective action.
   Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be
dealt with appropriately. False or malicious complaints will be subject to
appropriate disciplinary action.
11-2-10 SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION.  
   The Village prohibits a non-employee from soliciting any of the Village's
employees during the employee's working hours. The Village prohibits any
employee from soliciting, collecting from, or selling to any other employee
during working time of the soliciting employee or of the employee being
solicited. "Working time" means the time during which either the solicited
employee should be working but does not include meal-times break periods, or
other periods when employees are not actively at work.
11-2-11 CONDUCT/DISCPLINARY AND PROCEDURES.  
   The orderly and efficient operation of the Village requires that employees
maintain standards of proper conduct and adhere to Village policies and
practices. To that end, the Village has established rules that must be
followed. Most rules involve common sense and accepted standards of good
conduct. The Village considers commission of any of the following or similar
acts serious and grounds for discipline.
   •   First Violation - Verbal Warning (must be documented)
   •   Second Violation - Written Warning
   •   Third Violation - Up to and including suspension or termination
   While the list below provides examples of conduct that will result in
discipline, it is not all-inclusive. The Mayor and/or your immediate supervisor
retains the sole discretion to determine appropriate discipline, up to and

supervisor. Requests should be made with a reasonable amount of advance notice.
Where multiple employees request the same vacation days, employees with

of an eight (8) hour workday. Vacation time may be taken on a daily or weekly
basis.
   Any full-time employee who has worked for the Village for at least one (1)

completion of six (6) months of full-time employment. Time spent by an employee
during a period when she/he is not on the active payroll due to termination,
layoff or leave of absence shall not constitute service time for the purpose of
accruing sick leave.

injury for three (3) days or more, must present a certification signed by a
licensed physician confirming said illness or injury, to the Mayor, Village
Clerk or immediate supervisor. The employee will not be paid for sick leave
where there is sufficient evidence of the abuse of said sick leave, including
but not limited to situations where the employee is not ill or injured. The

conditions.
(Ord. No. 23-022; 12-12-23)

deposition is eligible to receive full compensation, less the amount the
employee receives from the court as jury pay, for up to five (5) days in any
given calendar year. Subject to any contrary legal requirements, additional
time off for jury beyond the first five (5) days will be unpaid (unless the
employee chooses to apply available accrued paid vacation days or paid personal
days to the absence). Any absence for jury duty, paid or unpaid, will be
considered excused, and during any unpaid period of such leave, the employee
will be treated in the same manner as any other employee on unpaid leave. The
Village may require proof of court attendance, such as a jury summons or a
subpoena.
11-3-7 MILITARY LEAVE.

(810 ILCS 190/1 et seq.), the Village allows an eligible employee who is the
victim of domestic or sexual violence, or who has a family or household member

injuries
   •   obtain services from a victim services organization
   •   obtain psychological or other counseling
   •   participate in safety planning, relocation, or other activities to

intermittently, or on a reduced work schedule. VESSA leave is unpaid, but
employees may elect to use accrued paid leave as part of their VESSA leave.
Employees may not take VESSA leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed
under the FMLA Policy.
   An employee who requires VESSA leave or some other reasonable accommodation
is responsible for bringing the matter to the attention of the Mayor, Village
Clerk, or immediate supervisor.
11-3-10 TUITION REIMBURSEMENT.
   The Village Board may approve tuition reimbursement to employees who are
required to obtain certifications of skills for Village operations, with prior
Board approval.
11-3-11 WORKPLACE INJURY.
   If you become injured on the job, you may be eligible for Workers'
Compensation benefits. Any injury must be immediately reported to your
Supervisor, no matter how slight and regardless of whether you believe you need
medical attention at the time of injury. Failure to immediately report any
work-related injury (no matter how slight) may be subject to disciplinary
action or to termination.
11-3-12 UNPAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE (FMLA).
   (A)   Eligibility. Any employee who 1) has been employed by the employer for
at least twelve (12) months, 2) worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty
(1,250) hours during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the
commencement of the leave.
   Eligible employees are entitled to a total of twelve (12) work weeks of
leave for the following reasons:
   •   Because of the birth of a child of the employee, in order to care for
that child.
   •   Because of the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or
foster care.
   •   In order to care for the spouse, domestic partner or parent of the
employee if that spouse or parent has a serious health condition, or in order
to care of a son or daughter of the employee if that son or daughter has a
serious health condition and is under the age of eighteen (18) or, if eighteen
(18) years or older, is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental
disability.
   •   Because of the employee's own serious health condition, that makes the
employee unable to perform the functions of his or her position.
   The annual entitlement to twelve (12) work weeks of leave is measured on a
"rolling" basis which looks backward to the twelve (12)-month period ending on
the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. That is, each time an employee takes
FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the twelve
(12) weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding twelve (12)
months.
   (B)   Hospital Care. Inpatient care (i.e. an overnight stay) in a hospital,
hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of
incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care.
   (C)   Absence Plus Treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three (3)
consecutive calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period of
incapacity relating to the same condition), that also involves:
   •   Treatment two (2) or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse or
physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by
a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by a health
care provider; or
   •   Treatment by a health care provider on at least one (1) occasion which
results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the
health care provider.
   (D)   Pregnancy. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal
care.
    (E)   Chronic Conditions Requiring Treatments. Any period of incapacity or
treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A
chronic serious health condition is one which:
   •   Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or by
a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health provider
   •   Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes
of a single underlying condition); and
   •   May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g,
asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc).
   (F)   Permanent/Long-term Conditions Requiring Supervision. A period of
incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which
treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the
continuing supervision of, but not be receiving active treatment by, a health
provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a stroke, or the terminal stages of a
disease.
   (G)   Multiple Treatments (Non-Chronic Conditions). Any period of absence to
receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a
health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of,
or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after
an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a
period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive calendar days in the
absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer (chemotherapy,
radiation, etc.) severe arthritis (physical therapy), kidney disease
(dialysis).
   Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flue, ear
aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraine, routine
dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease, etc. are example of
conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do
not qualify for family and medical leave.
   Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this
term are otherwise met. However, family and medical leave may only be taken for
treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of
health care services on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand,
absence because of the employee's use of the substance, rather than treatment,
does not qualify for family and medical leave.
   (H)   Intermittent Leave. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced
hours basis when medically necessary, or to provide care or psychological
comfort to an immediate family member with serious health condition. If an
employee requests that his or her leave be taken on an intermittent or reduced
hours basis, the employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily to
an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that better
accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position.
   (I)   Spouse's Employed by Same Employer. A husband and wife who are both
employed by the same employer are entitled to take only a combined total of
twelve (12) weeks of leave during the applicable twelve (12)-month period if
the leave is taken pursuant to reasons above, or to care of the employee's
parent with a serious condition.
   (J)   Substitution of Paid Leave. Employees are required to use all
available accrued paid leave concurrently with FMLA leave to the extent allowed
by the FMLA. Any FMLA leave remaining after all applicable accrued leave has
been exhausted will be without pay. Employees weekly worker's compensation
benefits or benefits pursuant to a temporary disability benefit plan may not
supplement these benefits with accrued paid leave unless doing so is agreed on
by both the employer and the employee.
   (K)   Notice. If the necessity for leave is foreseeable, the employee must
notify the employer in advance of his or her intention to take leave, at least
thirty (30) days before the leave is to begin. If the thirty (30)-day notice is
impracticable, the employee shall provide as much advance notice as is
practicable. An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA leave must
explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the employer to
determine that the leave qualifies under the FMLA. Failure to provide notice as
required in this paragraph may result in delay of the leave.
   (L)   Medical Certification. All requests for leave for a reason set forth
in paragraphs above must be supported by a certification issued by the health
care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the employee's
son, daughter, spouse, domestic partner or parent, as appropriate.
   The employer will provide the certification forms for completion by the
health care provider. Use of these forms is required. The employee must provide
the certification within fifteen (15) calendar days after the employer requests
certification, unless it is not practicable under the circumstances to do so
despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. Where an employee fails to
timely provide the required certification, FMLA leave may be delayed or denied.
   When the employee provides a certification, which is incomplete or
insufficient and the employer provides the employee with notice and opportunity
to cure the deficiency, the employee will have seven (7) calendar days to cure
the deficiency with a resubmitted certification.
   The employer may obtain clarification and authentication of certifications,
and may require recertification and fitness for duty certifications as allowed
by federal regulation. Certifications may also be subject to second and third
opinions.
   (M)   Return to Work. Where practicable under the circumstances, employees
will be required to contact their immediate supervisor every two (2) weeks to
report on the employee's status and intent to return to work. Where a change in
circumstances modifies the anticipated duration of the FMLA leave, the employee
must provide the employer reasonable notice, within two (2) business days, of
the changed circumstances where foreseeable. An employee who fails to return to
work or contact the employer regarding his or her status following conclusion
of FMLA leave will be considered to have voluntarily quit the employment of the
conclusion of the FMLA leave.
   (N)   FMLA for Military Families. An eligible employee who is the spouse,
domestic partner, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service
member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury which was sustained
or aggravated in the line of duty on active duty is entitle to up to twenty-six
(26) weeks of leave in a single twelve (12) month period.
   (O)   Active Duty Family Leave (Exigency Leave). Eligible employees are
entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of leave because of "any qualifying
exigency" arising out of the fact that the spouse, domestic partner, son,
daughter, or parent of the employee is a member of any branch of the Armed
Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, and is on active duty in a
foreign country or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status
in a foreign country. This leave is subject to the same aggregate twelve (12)
weeks of FMLA leave per rolling year as the traditional forms of FMLA leave.
   Both types of military family FMLA leave are subject to certification or
other verification requirements.
   (P)   General Provisions. The employer is the sole administrator of this
policy and, as such, is the exclusive interpreter of its terms. The employer
reserves the right to modify this policy at any time.
   All provisions of this policy shall be interpreted consistent with the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended.
   For further information regarding employee rights and responsibilities under
the Family and Medical Leave Act see WHD Publication 1420.
11-3-13 RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM.
   The Village is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to
qualified individuals with disabilities. This includes providing reasonable
accommodation where appropriate in order for a qualified individual, whether an
applicant for employment or an existing employee, to perform the essential
functions of the job in question.
   It is the policy of the Village of Hamel to provide modified or alternate
work when appropriate for an employee injured on the job, who is unable to
temporarily or permanently return to his/her regular job classification.
Regular modified and alternative work will be provided as available and
appropriate in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   It is your responsibility to notify the Village if you need an
accommodation. We ask that you make any and all such requests to the Village
President and in writing. After receiving your request, the Village will engage
in an interactive dialogue with you to determine the precise limitation of your
disability on your ability to perform the essential job duties of your position
and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those
limitations.
   The Village encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations
that you believe would allow you to perform your job. However, the Village is
not required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may
provide an alternative, effective accommodation, to the extent any reasonable
accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on the Village.

   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE VILLAGE OF
HAMEL, COUNTY OF MADISON, AND THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, AS FOLLOWS:
   Section 1. It is the intent of the parties by this Ordinance to extend for
an additional term, subject to the terms and conditions here stated, the
authorization to Ameren Illinois, its successors and assigns, to construct,
operate and maintain a utility system within the Village as originally
authorized by Ordinance No. 83 approved on November 13, 1963. The parties
acknowledge that by so doing they are continuing an existing relationship
authorizing the services of a utility for the provision of electric energy and
other purposes within the Village for the benefit of its citizens and residents
as well as other consumers of electric energy located within its corporate
limits. For purposes of construing the terms, rights and obligations of the
parties this authorization is granted pursuant to Section 14 of the Electric
Supplier Act, 220 ILCS 30/14, and the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/1-1-
1 et seq.
   Section 2. There is hereby given and granted to Ameren Illinois, its
successors and assigns (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”), the right,
privilege and authority to construct, operate, maintain and/or extend within
the corporate limits, as the same now exists or may hereafter be extended, of
the Village of Hamel (hereinafter referred to as “Municipality”), an electric
utility system for the transmission, distribution and/or sale of electric
energy and other purposes (the “System”), together with the right, privilege
and authority to erect, construct, install, operate and/or maintain all poles,
conductors, wires, cables, conduits, equipment and/or other apparatus as may be
necessary or convenient for the System, in, upon, along, over, under, through
and/or across each and all of the streets, avenues, alleys, bridges, easements,
rights of way and/or other public places.
   Section 3. All poles and other equipment placed or installed under this
Ordinance in streets, alleys, avenues, public places, or right-of-way, shall be
so placed as not to interfere unnecessarily with travel on such streets,
alleys, avenues, public places, or right-of-way. All poles and other equipment
placed or installed under this Ordinance shall be so located as not to injure
unnecessarily any pipes, conduits, sewers, drains, pavement or other like
public improvements, and said Company shall forthwith repair any damage caused
to such improvements to the satisfaction of the official or officials of said
Municipality having charge of the supervision thereof and in default said
Municipality may repair such damage and charge the cost thereof to, and collect
the same from, the Company. All facilities of Company in said Municipality
shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission.
   When any roadway within a right-of-way shall be graded, curbed, paved or
otherwise changed or when there is a relocation of such right-of-way, so as to
make the resetting or relocation of any poles or other equipment placed or
installed under this Ordinance necessary, the Company shall make such resetting
or relocation, at the Company’s cost and expense.
   Municipality shall provide the Company with a suitable location for the
resetting or relocation of such poles or other equipment, and the Company’s
obligation shall be limited to resetting or relocating poles or other equipment
of the same type and configuration as the displaced poles or other equipment.
Company shall make such resetting or relocation within a reasonable time after
receiving written notice of the need for the same from the authorized
representative of the Municipality, and the establishment by the Municipality
of the permanent grade at the new location. Except as expressly stated, nothing
in this Section requires the Company to bear responsibility for any costs or
expenses to relocate its poles or other equipment for any other reason or
cause.
   Section 4. In order for Company to render efficient, safe, and continuous
services, it will be necessary for Company to conduct vegetation management
activities, including the trimming or pruning and cutting down of the trunks
and branches of trees and/or vines and shrubs along or over the streets,
sidewalks, alleys, avenues, squares, bridges and other public places in said
Municipality, and areas dedicated to the Municipality for public utility use,
wherever the same are likely to interfere with its equipment; therefor, Company
is hereby granted the right to conduct such vegetation management activities so
as to enable it to erect, operate and maintain its equipment in a regular and
consistent form and manner and to enable it to provide the most efficient,
safe, and continuous service that the circumstances will permit; provided,
however, that Company shall exercise proper care and discretion in its
vegetation management activities. Company shall conduct its vegetation
management activities in accordance with applicable law, including without
limitation, 220 ILCS 5/8-505.1, and any amendments thereto. Notwithstanding the

agreement between Municipality and Company, Municipality and Company reserve
the right to enter into such an agreement.
   Section 5. The rates to be charged by the Company for electric service
rendered under this Ordinance shall be such as are approved from time to time
by the Illinois Commerce Commission of the State of Illinois and/or such other
duly constituted governmental authority as shall have jurisdiction thereof. All
Rules and Regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission of the State of
Illinois applicable to the rights, privileges and authority granted by this
Ordinance, in the event of conflict herewith, shall govern.
   Section 6. As a further consideration for the rights, privileges and
authorities granted by this Ordinance, the Company shall, in Year 1 of the

following graduated scale: Year 2 - $16,975; Year 3 - $12,650; Year 4 - $8,325;
and Year 5 and all remaining years – $4,000. Municipality may request a
revision to the compensation amount after five years from the date of passage
of this Ordinance if Municipality has a reasonable belief that its population
has increased or decreased by 3% or more. Municipality must request the
revision at least 60 days prior to the next anniversary date. If Company
confirms that the number of customers served by the System within
Municipality’s corporate limits has increased or decreased by 3% or more, the
compensation amount will be revised by that percentage for the next and
succeeding payments. Municipality may request similar revisions to compensation
amounts under these criteria in additional five year periods throughout the
term of this Ordinance.
   Section 7. If, at any time, during the term of this contract, Municipality
permits another entity or person to provide electric distribution or similar
services, and Company reasonably believes the other entity or person is granted
more favorable treatment, terms, or conditions, then Company shall notify the
Municipality of such treatment, terms, or conditions. Alternatively, if
Municipality reasonably believes the other entity or person grants Municipality
more favorable treatment, terms, or conditions, then Municipality shall notify
Company of such treatment, terms, or conditions. Upon receipt of such notice,
Municipality and Company shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Ordinance
to provide Company or Municipality such more favorable treatment, terms or
conditions on an equivalent basis. Such amendment shall take into consideration
all circumstances that distinguish between Company and the entity or person
receiving the more favorable or less favorable treatment, terms, or conditions.
   Section 8. The Company shall be exempt from any special tax, assessment,
license, rental or other charge during the term of this Ordinance, on all
poles, conductors, wires, cables, conduits, equipment and other apparatus

the obligations hereby imposed upon Company shall devolve and be binding upon
its successors and assigns, successively, in the same manner.

Company, its successors or assigns, unless Company shall within ninety (90)
days after due notice to the Company of the enactment of this Ordinance, file
with the Village Clerk an acceptance of the terms and provisions hereof;
provided, however, that if such acceptance be not so filed within said period
of ninety (90) days, all rights, privileges, and authority herein granted shall
become null and void.
   Section 11. All rights, privileges and authority given and granted by this
Ordinance are granted for a term of 20 years from and after the acceptance of
this Ordinance as hereinafter provided (the “Initial Term”), and thereafter on
a year-to-year basis (each a “Subsequent Term”) unless either the Company or
Municipality notifies the other in writing of its desire to terminate this
Ordinance at least six (6) months prior to the expiration of the Initial Term
or any Subsequent Term.
   Section 12. The Municipality acknowledges that Company is vested in rights,
permissions and authority independent of this Ordinance. Neither acceptance of
this Ordinance nor compliance with its provisions shall impair in any way or
waive any right, permission or authority which Company may have independent of
this Ordinance. In addition, neither use by Company of public property or
places as authorized by this Ordinance nor service rendered by Company in said
Municipality shall be treated as use solely of the rights, permission and
authority provided for by this Ordinance and in no way shall indicate non-use
of any right, permission or authority vested in the Company independent of this
Ordinance. In the event the Municipality vacates any streets, avenues, alleys,
easements, rights of way, bridges or other public places during the term of
this Ordinance, Municipality agrees to reserve unto Company the rights,
privileges and authority herein given and granted to the Company in, upon,
along, over and across each and all of such vacated premises which are at the
time in use by the Company.
   Section 13. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with this
Ordinance or with any of its provisions are, to the extent of such conflict,
hereby repealed.

Municipality prior to commencement of construction of facilities within the
streets thereof, except Company shall not be required to obtain permits or
other approval from the Municipality for the maintenance, upgrading and repair
of its constructed facilities. Company shall provide notice of excavation
hereunder in accordance with the Illinois Underground Utility Damage Prevention
Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)

provision to particular circumstances, shall be held invalid, the remainder of
this Ordinance, or the application of such provision to circumstances other
than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.
   Section 16. Any conflict between the Franchise Ordinance and the provisions
contained in the Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Law of 1997
(Public Act 90-561) will be resolved by giving the state statute mandatory
priority over any contrary language contained in the Franchise Ordinance.
   Section 17. This Ordinance shall take effect and the rights, privileges and
authority hereby granted and renewed shall vest in Company upon its filing of
an acceptance with the Village Clerk according to the terms prescribed herein
and as provided for in Section 12 and in IL Rev 35 ILCS 645/5-4. This Ordinance

CHAPTER 22
MANDATED POLICIES
ARTICLE I – IDENTITY THEFT PROGRAMS
DIVISION I - PREVENTION POLICY
22-1-1 PROGRAM ADOPTION.
   The Village developed this Identity Theft Prevention Program pursuant to the
Federal Trade Commission’s Red Flags Rule, which implements Section 114 of the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions of 2003. 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. This Program
was developed with oversight and approval of the Village. After consideration
of the size and complexity of the Utility’s operations and account systems, and
the nature and scope of the Utility’s activities, the Village Board determined
that this Program was appropriate for the Village, and therefore approved this
Program on February 9, 2009.
22-1-2 PROGRAM PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Fulfilling Requirements of the Red Flags Rule.
   Under the Red Flag Rule, every financial institution and creditor is
required to establish an “Identity Theft Prevention Program” tailored to its
size, complexity and the nature of its operation. Each program must contain
reasonable policies and procedures to:
      (1)   Identify relevant Red Flags for new and existing covered accounts
and incorporate those Red Flags into the Program;
      (2)   Detect Red Flags that have been incorporated into the Program;
      (3)   Respond appropriately to any Red Flags that are detected to prevent
and mitigate Identity Theft; and
      (4)   Ensure the Program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in
risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from Identity
Theft.
   (B)   Red Flags Rule Definitions Used in this Program.
   The Red Flags Rule defines “Identity Theft” as “fraud committed using the
identifying information of another person” and a “Red Flag” as “a pattern,
practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of
Identity Theft.”
   According to the Rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject to the Rule
requirements. The Rule defines creditors “to include finance companies,
automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications
companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer payment for goods or
services, they, too, are to be considered creditors.”
   All the Utility’s accounts that are individual utility service accounts held
by customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial are
covered by the Rule. Under the Rule, a “covered account” is:
      (1)   Any account the Utility offers or maintains primarily for personal,
family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions;
and
      (2)   Any other account the Utility offers or maintains for which there
is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of
the Utility from Identity Theft.
   “Identifying information” is defined under the Rules as “any name or number
that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to
identify a specific person,” including: name, address, telephone number, social
security number, date of birth, government issued driver’s license or
identification number, alien registration number, government passport number,
employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification
number, computer’s Internet Protocol address, or routing code.
22-1-3 IDENTIFICATION OF RED FLAGS.
   In order to identify relevant Red Flags, the Utility considers the types of
accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its
accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous
experiences with Identity Theft. The Utility identifies the following red
flags, in each of the listed categories:
   (A)   Notifications and Warnings From Credit Reporting Agencies; Red Flags.
      (1)   Report of fraud accompanying a credit report;
      (2)   Notice or report from a credit agency of a credit freeze on a
customer or applicant;
      (3)   Notice or report from a credit agency of an active duty alert for
an applicant; and
      (4)   Indication from a credit report of activity that is inconsistent
with a customer’s usual pattern or activity.
   (B)   Suspicious Documents; Red Flags.
      (1)   Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered
or inauthentic;
      (2)   Identification document or card on which a person’s photograph or
physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document;
      (3)   Other document with information that is not consistent with
existing customer information (such as if a person’s signature on a check
appears forged); and
      (4)   Application for service that appears to have been altered or
forged.
   (C)   Suspicious Personal Identifying Information; Red Flags.
      (1)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates);
      (2)   Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other
sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a
credit report);
      (3)   Identifying information presented that is the same as information
shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent;
      (4)   Identifying information presented that is consistent with
fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing
address);
      (5)   Social security number presented that is the same as one given by
another customer;
      (6)   An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of
another person;
      (7)   A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information
on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social security
numbers must not be required); and
      (8)   A person’s identifying information is not consistent with the
information that is on file for the customer.
   (D)   Suspicious Account Activity or Unusual Use of Account; Red Flags.
      (1)   Change of address for an account followed by a request to change
the account holder’s name;
      (2)   Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account;
      (3)   Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use
(example: very high activity);
      (4)   Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as
undeliverable;
      (5)   Notice to the Utility that a customer is not receiving mail sent by
the Utility;
      (6)   Notice to the Utility that an account has unauthorized activity;
      (7)   Breach in the Utility’s computer system security; and
      (8)   Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information.
   (E)   Alerts From Others; Red Flag.
      (1)   Notice to the Utility from a customer, identity theft victim, law
enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in Identity Theft.
22-1-4 DETECTING RED FLAGS.
   (A)   New Accounts.
   In order to detect any of the Red Flags identified above associated with the
opening of a new account, Utility personnel will take the following steps to
obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account:
      (1)   Require certain identifying information such as name, date of
birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an
entity, driver’s license or other identification;
      (2)   Verify the customer’s identity (for instance, review a driver’s
license or other identification card);
      (3)   Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity;
and
      (4)   Independently contact the customer.
   (B)   Existing Accounts.
   In order to detect any of the Red Flags identified above for an existing
account, Utility personnel will take the following steps to monitor
transactions with an account:
      (1)   Verify the identification of customers if they request information
(in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email);
      (2)   Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and
      (3)   Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment
purposes.
22-1-5 PREVENTING AND MITIGATING IDENTITY THEFT.
   (A)   Prevent and Mitigate.
   In the event Utility personnel detect any identified Red Flags, such
personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the
degree of risk posed by the Red Flag:
      (1)   Continue to monitor an account for evidence of Identity Theft;
      (2)   Contact the customer;
      (3)   Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access
to accounts;
      (4)   Not open a new account;
      (5)   Close an existing account;
      (6)   Reopen an account with a new number;
      (7)   Notify the Program Administrator for determination of the
appropriate step(s) to take;
      (8)   Notify law enforcement; or
      (9)   Determine that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
   (B)   Protect Customer Identifying Information.
   In order to further prevent the likelihood of Identity Theft occurring with
respect to Utility accounts, the Utility will take the following steps with
respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying
information:
      (1)   Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the
website is not secure;
      (2)   Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and
computer files containing customer information;
      (3)   Ensure that office computers are password protected and that
computer screens lock after a set period of time;
      (4)   Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information;
      (5)   Request only the last 4 digits of social security numbers (if any);
      (6)   Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and
      (7)   Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are
necessary for utility purposes.
22-1-6 PROGRAM UPDATES.
   The Program Administrator will periodically review and update this Program
to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the Utility from
Identity Theft. In doing so, the Program Administrator will consider the
Utility’s experiences with Identity Theft situations, changes in Identity Theft
methods, changes in Identity Theft detection and prevention methods, and
changes in the Utility’s business arrangements with other entities. After
considering these factors, the Program Administrator will determine whether
changes to the Program, including the listing of Red Flags, are warranted. If
warranted, the Program Administrator will update the Program or present the
Village Board with his or her recommended changes and the Village Board will
make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to
the Program.
22-1-7 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   Oversight.
   Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating this Program lies
with an Identity Theft Committee for the Utility. The Committee is headed by a
Program Administrator who may be the head of the Utility or his or her
appointee. Two or more other individuals appointed by the head of the Utility
or the Program Administrator comprise the remainder of the committee
membership. The Program Administrator will be responsible for the Program
administration, for ensuring appropriate training of Utility staff on the
Program, for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of Red Flags
and the steps for preventing and mitigating Identity Theft, determining which
steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances
and considering periodic changes to the Program.
   (B)   Staff Training and Reports.
   Utility staff responsible for implementing the Program shall be trained
either by or under the direction of the Program Administrator in the detection
of Red Flags, and the responsive steps to be taken when a Red Flag is detected.
   (C)   Service Provider Arrangements.
   In the event the Utility engages a service provider to perform an activity
in connection with one or more accounts, the Utility will take the following
steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with
reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate
the risk of Identity Theft.
      (1)   Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and
procedures in place; and
      (2)   Require, by contract, that service providers review the Utility’s
Program and report any Red Flags to the Program Administrator.
   (D)   Non-Disclosure of Specific Practices.
   For the effectiveness of this Identity Theft Prevention Program, knowledge
about specific Red Flag identification, detection, mitigation and prevention
practices must be limited to the Identity Theft Committee who developed this
Program and to those employees with a need to know them. Any documents that may
have been produced or are produced in order to develop or implement this
program that list or describe such specific practices and the information those
documents contain are considered “security information” as defined in Minnesota
Statutes Section 13.37 and are unavailable to the public because disclosure of
them would be likely to substantially jeopardized the security of information
against improper use, that use being to circumvent the Utility’s Identity Theft
prevention efforts in order to facilitate the commission of Identity Theft.

commercial purpose within twenty-one (21) working days after receipt. The
response shall (1) provide to the person making the request an estimate of the
time required by the Village to provide the records requested and an estimate
of the fees to be charged, which the Village may require the person to pay in
full before copying the requested documents, (2) deny the request pursuant to
one (1) or more of the exemptions set out in the Freedom of Information Act, 5
ILCS 140/1 et seq., (3) notify the person making the request that the request
is unduly burdensome and extend an opportunity to the person making the request
to attempt to reduce the request to manageable portions, or (4) provide the
records requested.
   Unless the records are exempt from disclosure, the Village shall comply with
a commercial request within a reasonable period considering the size and
complexity of the request, and giving priority to records requested for non-
commercial purposes.
   It is unlawful for a person to knowingly obtain a public record for a
commercial purpose within disclosing that it is for a commercial purpose, and
any person obtaining a public record for commercial purpose without disclosing
that it is for a commercial purpose shall be fined in accordance with the
Village Code.
22-2-6 FEES.
   The Village Clerk shall determine when the established fees are subject to
waiver or reduction because the release of the requested information is in the
public interest.

   The Village Clerk shall establish and maintain a central file, open to the
public, of all denials of requests for records which shall be indexed according
to the exemption utilized to deny a request for records, and to the extent
possible, according to the types of records requested.
22-2-8 GRANTING OR DENIAL OF REQUESTS.
   A request for all records within a category shall be granted unless the
request constitutes an undue burden upon the Village. Prior to denying a
request based upon the burdensome nature of the request, an opportunity to
narrow the request to manageable proportions shall be provided. If the attempt
to narrow the request fails, the request may be denied because compliance will
unduly burden the operations of the Village and the burden outweighs the public
interest in the information. The denial shall be in writing, specifying the
reasons why compliance will be unduly burdensome and the extent to which
compliance will so burden the operations of the Village. Repeated requests from
the same person for the same records that are unchanged or identical to records
previously provided are properly denied under the Freedom of Information Act
shall be deemed unduly burdensome under this Section.
22-2-9 CERTAIN INFORMATION EXEMPT FROM INSPECTION AND COPYING.
   If any record exempt from disclosure contains material which is not exempt,
the information which is exempt shall be deleted and the remaining information
shall be available for inspection and copying.

   (A)   If the Village denies the request, the Village shall notify the person
making the request in writing of:
      (1)   the decision to deny the request;
      (2)   the reasons for the denial, including a detailed factual basis for
the application of any exemption claim;
      (3)   the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for
the denial;
      (4)   the right to review by the Public Access Counselor and the address
and phone number for the Public Access Counselor; and
      (5)   the right to judicial review.
   If an exemption is claimed, then the denial must include the specific
reasons for the denial, including a detailed factual basis and a citation to
support a legal authority.
   (B)   If the Village asserts an exemption under Subsection (1)(c) or (1)(f)
of Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, it shall, within the time
periods provided for Respondent to request, provide written notice to the
person making the request and the Public Access Counselor of its intent to deny
the request in whole or in part. The notice shall include:
      (1)   a copy of the request for access to records;
      (2)   the proposed response from the Village;
      (3)   a detailed summary of the Village’s basis for asserting its
exemption.
   If the Public Access Counselor determines that further inquiry is warranted,
the procedures set forth in the Freedom of Information Act, as amended from
time to time, regarding the review of denials shall be applicable. Times for
response compliance by the Village to the request shall be tolled until the
Public Access Counselor concludes his or her inquiry.

ARTICLE VIII – DRUG/ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY AND PROCEDURE
22-8-1 DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   The Village is committed to maintaining a drug free workplace pursuant to
the federal and state Drug Free Workplace Acts, 41 U.S.C.A. § 701 et seq., 30
ILCS 580/1 et seq. It is the policy of the Village that the public has the
reasonable right to expect persons employed by the Village to be free from the
effects of alcohol and drugs. The Village, as the employer, has the right to
expect its employees to report for work fit and able for duty. This policy is
intended to ensure that Village employees are not impaired in their ability to
perform assigned duties in a safe, healthy and productive manner and to protect
any such employee and the public from the risks associated with the adverse
effects of drugs and alcohol. Accordingly, the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, possession, or use of a controlled substance, including cannabis
and alcohol, is prohibited in the workplace or while acting on behalf of the
Village. Employees are required to sign a release and consent/authorization
form, a copy of which is included with this policy, at the time the policy is
distributed to the employee.
22-8-2 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:
   (A)   “Abuse of alcohol” or “being under the influence of alcohol” means the
consumption of any beverage, mixture or preparation, including any medication
containing alcohol, which results in an employee being intoxicated. Intoxicated
or a positive test for alcohol shall mean a test result which shows an alcohol
concentration of .02 or more for all persons covered by Federal DOT regulations
and .08 or more for all persons not covered by Federal DOT regulations.
   (B)   “Abuse of any drug” means the use of any illegal drug, the use of any
prescription drug which has not been legally prescribed and dispensed, or the
misuse of any legally prescribed drug.
   (C)   “Drug” means any controlled substances listed in the Federal
Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., or the Illinois Controlled
Substances Act, 720 ILCS 570/100 et seq. , and cannabis as defined in the state
Cannabis Controlled Act, 720 ILCS 550 et seq.
22-8-3 PROHIBITED ACTIONS.
   Employees shall be prohibited from:
   (A)   Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, sale,
purchase, abuse of alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol at any time
during the course of the employee’s workday or anywhere on or in any Village-
owned property, including Village buildings and Village-owned vehicles.
   (B)   Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, use, sale,
purchase, being under the influence of or abuse of any drug at any time and at
any place.
   (C)   Failure to immediately disclose to his or her Department Head or
immediate supervisor any drug or other medication-related work restrictions, or
failure to disclose the taking of any drug or medication whose container has
warnings that such drug or medication may affect any such employee’s ability to
perform his or her job, or to drive or operate machinery.
   (D)   Testing positive for any drug or for the abuse of alcohol or being
under the influence of any drug and/or alcohol during working hours.
   (E)   Failure to comply with this policy.
   (F)   Refusal to submit to any drug or alcohol test under this policy, which
shall also include, but not be limited to, any attempt to tamper with or
substitute any sample to be used in connection with any such test.
22-8-4 APPLICABILITY.
   This Drug/Alcohol Testing Policy and Procedure is not intended to replace
the Drug Free Workplace Programs but to define and clarify, who will be tested,
when the employees will be tested and where employees will be tested. The
following four employee categories define under which category each full time,
part time/temporary and volunteer employee will be tested:
   (A)   Any employee who drives a Village vehicle, tractor, tractor mower or
similar motor powered equipment that moves under its own power will be tested
under the Federal DOT testing standards.
   (B)   Testing for employees of the Police Department shall be controlled by
the provisions set forth in their union contract.
   (C)   All other Village employees who are not included within the two
categories listed above in (A) or (B) will be subject to testing to comply with
the requirements necessary to establish a Drug Free Workplace within the
Village.
   (E)   Part time/temporary employees and volunteer employees of the Village
will remain exempt from pre-employment and random testing as defined in this
testing program, but they can be included for testing if reasonable suspicion
should arise, or an accident should occur during the tenure of their part time/
temporary or volunteer employment. After reasonable suspicion of abuse of drugs
or alcohol has been established or an accident should occur, the decision to
request a drug and alcohol test for the employee must be deemed necessary and
reasonable by the Mayor and/or the supervisor of the employee.
22-8-5 TESTING PROCEDURE.
   In conducting any drug testing under this policy, the Village shall:
   (A)   Use only a clinical laboratory or hospital facility that is licensed
pursuant to the Illinois Clinical Laboratory and Blood Bank Act, 210 ILCS 25/
101 et seq. , that has been or is capable of being accredited by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse (“NIDA”).
   (B)   Insure that the laboratory or facility selected conforms to all NIDA
standards.
   (C)   Follow all Federal DOT guidelines for the collection, testing and
reporting procedures.
   (D)   In conducting any alcohol testing under this policy, the Village shall
use a facility that:
      (1)   Ensures that all technicians are trained and equipment is
calibrated.
      (2)   Conducts breath test to detect the presence of alcohol or blood
tests if circumstances require.
   (E)   The fees for drug/alcohol testing shall be paid as follows:
      (1)   Pre-employment testing will be paid by the Village.
      (2)   Post accident tests shall be paid by the Village.
      (3)   Reasonable suspicion testing will be paid by the Village.
      (4)   Random testing will be paid by the Village.
      (5)   Retesting at the request of the employee after a positive drug or
alcohol test shall be at the employee’s sole expense.
      (6)   Drug/Alcohol test for renewal of CDL Driver’s License shall be paid
by the Village.
22-8-6 SCREENING AND TESTING.
   (A)   Pre-Employment Testing.
      (1)   All employee applicants shall be advised of the Village Drug/
Alcohol testing requirements at the time of interview. After having
successfully completed the interview process, the selected prospective full
time employee shall then be required to successfully complete the Village’s
drug screening test, as part of his/her background investigation.
      (2)   All applicants for full time employment shall sign a release and
consent/authorization form for Drug/Alcohol testing.
      (3)   An applicant will not be employed or considered for employment if:
   the test results confirm POSITIVE;
   he/she refuses to complete the test;
   he/she tampers with, or adulterates the specimen;
   he/she fails to cooperate in the testing process (including executing all
required documentation).
   (B)   Testing Based on Reasonable Suspicion.
   If there is a reasonable suspicion that any Village employee, paid or
volunteer, has violated any of the prohibited actions covered by this policy,
such employee may be required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing.
Reasonable suspicion exists if the facts and circumstances warrant a rational
inference that an employee has violated any of the acts prohibited by this
policy. Reasonable suspicion shall be based upon the following:
      (1)   Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use or the
verifiable physical symptoms resulting from the abuse of drugs or being under
the influence of alcohol which may include by way of example but is not limited
to a pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, a dramatic decline in
work performance, excessive sick leave usage, difficulty in walking, slurred
speech, needle marks, glazed stare, and possession of alcohol, or unauthorized
banned substance or drug paraphernalia at work.
      (2)   Information provided by an identifiable, reliable and credible
third party that an employee has committed any of the acts prohibited by this
policy.
   In the event reasonable suspicion exists, the Village shall arrange for a
drug and/or alcohol test. When testing is ordered, the employee may be
temporarily reassigned or relieved from duty and placed on leave with pay
pending the receipt of the test results by the Village. The Village shall also
provide the employee with written notice setting forth the objective facts and
reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts which form the basis of the
reasonable suspicion.
   The employee will then be escorted to the testing facility or collection
facility by a designated supervisor immediately.
   After completing the test, the employee will be escorted to his/her
residence or at the option of his/her supervisor to another location to await
the test results, and the employee shall be off work with pay pending the
results of the tests. Under no circumstances shall the employee be allowed to
leave the work site or the test site driving his/her own vehicle or a Village
vehicle.
   Employees who test positive for either drugs or alcohol will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (C)   Random Testing.
   Random drug testing shall be conducted during working hours. Employees will
be selected at random for a drug test by a random drawing/lottery. The testing
times and dates are unannounced and are with unpredictable frequency throughout
the year.
   When testing is ordered, the employee will be directed to the testing
facility or collection facility within a reasonable period of time.
   After completing the test, the employee will return to work pending the
results of the test.
   Employees who test positive for drugs will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
   (D)   Post Accident Testing.
   Post accident drug/alcohol testing is required immediately following any
accident involving a Village employee, paid or volunteer, who operates Village
equipment or operates a Village vehicle where an injury to a person has
occurred or where damage to equipment, or property has occurred and that damage
exceeds One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), based on actual cost or reliable
estimates of damage.
   When testing is ordered, the employee will be escorted to the testing
facility or collection facility by a designated supervisor within a reasonable
period of time following the accident.
   Employees who test positive for either drugs or alcohol will be subject to
disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
   (E)   Testing Required for Position Required to Have a CDL.
   In addition to the provisions of this policy, any employee who is appointed
to a position required to have a commercial driver’s license (“CDL”) shall be
subject to drug and/or alcohol screening following any work related accident.
Mandatory drug screening shall also be required of all applicants chosen to be
hired for positions requiring a CDL. Those who fail the pre-employment drug
screening shall not be hired for those positions.
22-8-7 CONFIDENTIALITY OF TEST RESULTS.
   Any employee subject to a drug and/or alcohol test under this policy will be
provided a copy of all information and reports received by the Village in
connection with any drug and/or alcohol test and any results thereof under this
policy. Any results of drug and alcohol test will be disclosed to any employee
tested, the applicable supervisor, Village Attorney and those permitted by law.
22-8-8 CONSEQUENCES OF POSITIVE TEST RESULT OR REFUSAL TO COOPERATE.
   Any employee who refuses to cooperate in testing or who fails a test or
violates the Drug and Alcohol Policy shall be subject to disciplinary action,
up to and including termination.
ARTICLE IX – POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
22-9-1 PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person’s sex. The courts
have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title
VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have
a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual
harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders
and sexual orientations. It is a policy of this Village to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal
officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or
offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any
employment relationship or lack thereof.
22-9-2 DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   (A)   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when:
      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual’s employment,
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   (B)   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
      (1)   Verbal.
   Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex,
anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated
requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside their
presence, of a sexual nature.
      (2)   Non-verbal.
   Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures,
sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or “kissing”
noises.
      (3)   Visual.
   Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic
material or websites.
      (4)   Physical.
   Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any
coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      (5)   Textual/Electronic. “Sexting” (electronically sending messages with
sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit
language, harassment, cyber stalking or threats via all forms of electronic
communication (e-mail, text/picture/ video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
   (C)   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a “reasonable person.”
22-9-3 PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating his/her position to
the offending employee, and his/her immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   (B)   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      (1)   Electronic/Direct Communication.
   If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed
employee should directly and clearly express his/her objection that the conduct
is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message
may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing
in a note or a memo.
      (2)   Contact with Supervisory Personnel.
   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the
employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be
promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report,
a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the
village manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of the
Municipality.
   The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment
must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no
witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible
officer, the Municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the
harassment.
      (3)   Resolution Outside Municipality.
   The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective
procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be
identified and remedied by the Municipality. However, all municipal employees
have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing
a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within
three hundred (300) days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing
offense. A complaint with the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred
(300) days. (Ord. No. 18-19; 11-13-18)
   (C)   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   (D)   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
Municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant’s willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
22-9-4 PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS.
   (A)   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any
municipal employee due to a municipal employee’s:
      (1)   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this
policy,
      (2)   The provision of information related to or testimony before any
public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation
of this policy, or
      (3)   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   (B)   For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the
reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or
change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that
is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee’s involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
   (C)   No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   (D)   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge,
suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in
retaliation for an employee who does any of the following:
      (1)   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or
other State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in
violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
      (2)   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule, or regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State
employee; or
      (3)   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
   (E)   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer
may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a State or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a State or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   (F)   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   (G)   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or
passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may
file a retaliation charge – either due within three hundred (300) days of the
alleged retaliation. (Ord. No. 18-19; 11-13-18)
22-9-5 CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant
to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks
and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or
the Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be
subject to a fine of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per offense,
applicable discipline or discharge by the Municipality and any applicable fines
and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, State law or Federal
law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed
by the Municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by
an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
State or Federal agency.
22-9-6 CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT.  
   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.
   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the State Police, a State’s
Attorney, the Attorney General, or any other law enforcement official is guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine
of up to Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) against any person who intentionally
makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.
(Ord. No. 18-02; 01-09-18)

violation of this Code."

   It shall be unlawful to operate a vehicle in the Village in a careless
manner so as to interfere with the safe or lawful operation of any other

audible signal by a police officer directing such driver or operator to bring
his vehicle to a stop, willfully fails to or refuses to obey such direction,
increases his speed, extinguishes his lights or otherwise flees or attempts to
elude the officer is guilty of a violation of this Chapter. The signal given by

   The speed limits on the various streets shall be approved by the Village

otherwise thirty miles per hour (30 MPH) on an arterial street; unless

   (H)   Failure to Reduce Speed. A vehicle shall be driven upon the streets
and alleys of this Village at a speed which is reasonable and proper with
regard to traffic conditions and the use of the street or alley. The fact that
the vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve

drug, or who is under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders
him incapable of safely driving a vehicle may drive or be in actual physical
control of any vehicle within this Village. The fact that a person is charged
with a violation of this Section is or has been entitled to use such drug under
the law of this State does not constitute a defense against any charge of

24-8-3 BLOOD TESTS.
   Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of the acts alleged
to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, evidence
of the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood at the time of the act alleged,
as shown by chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine, saliva, or other
bodily substance is admissible, as provided hereinafter and the result of any
such analysis shall give rise to the following presumptions:
   (A)   If there was, at the time of such analysis, 0.05% or less by weight of
alcohol in the person’s blood, it shall be presumed that the person was not
under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
   (B)   If there was, at the time of such analysis, in excess of 0.05%, but
less than 0.08% by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood, such fact shall not
give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence
of intoxicating liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining whether such person was under the influence of
intoxicating liquor.
   (C)   If there was, at the time of such analysis, 0.08% or more by weight of
alcohol in the person’s blood, it shall be presumed that the person was under
the influence of intoxicating liquor.
   Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of
alcohol per one hundred (100) cubic centimeters of blood. Evidence based upon a
chemical analysis of blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall not
be admitted unless such substance was produced and such analysis made with the
consent of the person as provided by State Law, as amended, whose bodily
substance was so analyzed.
   The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as limiting
the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question
whether or not the person being tried was under the influence of intoxicating
liquor.
24-8-4 ADOPTION OF STATUTES.
   The provisions of the Illinois Compiled Statutes, as amended, regarding the

ARTICLE XI – ADULT USES REGULATED
27-11-1 PURPOSE AND ADDITIONAL FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose.
   It is the purpose of this Article to regulate public nudity in order to
promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the
Village. The provisions of this Article have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials.
   (B)   Findings.
   The Village Board finds:
      (1)   Public places allowing nudity lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at adult oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-
private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows or public
nudity.
      (3)   Allowing public nudity creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such adult oriented businesses.
      (5)   At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by
activities occurring in adult oriented businesses involving public nudity,
including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency
virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B
amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
      (6)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States.
      (7)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (8)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (9)   Sanitary conditions in some adult oriented businesses and those
places allowing public nudity are unhealthy, in part, because the activities
conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature
of the activities, including nudity, and the failure of the owners and the
operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain
those facilities.
      (10)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of adult oriented businesses allowing public nudity and where
persons view “adult” oriented films.
      (11)   The findings noted in paragraphs (1) through (10) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (12)   Public places allowing nudity have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (13)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the Village will be promoted by the enactment of this Article.

5/11-5-1.5)
ARTICLE XII - OBSCENITY
27-12-1 OBSCENITY.
   (A)   Elements of the Offense. A person commits an obscenity   when, with
the knowledge of the nature or content thereof or recklessly failing to
exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content
thereof, he:
      (1)   sells, delivers or provides or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or
provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene; or
      (2)   presents or directs an obscene play, dance, or other performance or
participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
      (3)   publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene;
or
      (4)   performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition
of his body for gain; or
      (5)   creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material
with intent to disseminate it in violation of this Section, or of the penal
laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      (6)   advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene Defined. Any material or performance is obscene if:
      (1)   the average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest; and
      (2)   the average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of Evidence.
   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except that it
shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible
audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances
of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an
audience.
   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination,
distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially
exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with
respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the
matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   In any prosecution for an offense under this Section, evidence shall be
admissible to show:
      (1)   the character of the audience for which the material was designed
or to which it was directed;
      (2)   what the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary
adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have
on the behavior of such people;
      (3)   the artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of
the material, or the absence thereof;
      (4)   the degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
State;
      (5)   appeal to prurient interest or absence thereof in advertising or
other promotion of the material;
      (6)   purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
   (D)   Prima Facie Evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plat or other embodiment or obscenity, specially
adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three
(3) copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate. (See 65 ILCS Sec. 5/11-5-1)
27-12-2 HARMFUL MATERIAL.
   (A)   Elements of the Offense.  A person who, with knowledge that a person
is a child; that is, a person under eighteen (18) years of age, or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly
distributes to, or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to or offers to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child is guilty of a violation
of this Code.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   Material is harmful if, to the average person applying contemporary
standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest;
that is, shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion which goes
substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or
representation of such matters and is material, the redeeming social importance
of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
      (2)   “Material” as used in this Code means any writing picture, record
or other representation or embodiment.
      (3)   “Distribute” means to transfer possession of material whether with
or without consideration.
      (4)   “Knowingly” as used in this Section means having knowledge of the
contents of the subject matter or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable
inspection which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
   (C)   Interpretation of Evidence. The predominant appeal to prurient
interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of
the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered,
distributed, sent or exhibited unless it appears from the nature of the matter
or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it
is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case, the predominant
appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or
probable recipient group.
   In prosecutions under this Section where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity, indicate the
material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal,
such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can
justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is,
in fact, substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   (D)   Affirmative Defenses.
      (1)   Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under eighteen (18) years of age,
provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational
purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a
violation of this Section that the act charged was committed in aid of
legitimate scientific or educational purposes.
      (2)   Nothing in this Section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his child any harmful material.
      (3)   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child shall be a
defense to any criminal prosecution under this Section:
         (a)   A document issued by the federal government or any state, county
or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not
limited to a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate
issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or an identification card issued
to a member of the armed forces.
      (4)   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in
this Section culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material to
a child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the
child by the defendant, his employees or agents as where the order or request
for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar means
of communication and delivery of such harmful material to the child was by
mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this Section that the advertisement contained
the following statement or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that
the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he was not under the age
of eighteen (18) years and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not

The purpose of this Article is to prevent harm to the health and safety of the

(Ord. No. 24-013; 8-13-24)
27-16-4 ENFORCEMENT; WARNINGS; REMOVAL AND CONFISCATION OF DEBRIS AND PERSONAL
PROPERTY.  
The Chief of Police, or their designee(s), will have primary responsibility for
the enforcement of the camping regulations herein. Nothing in this Article
shall prevent the Police Chief, or their designee(s), from obtaining voluntary
compliance by way of warning, notice, education, or coordination with other
willing public or private entities and/or community members.
   (A)   Prior to issuing any citation pursuant to this Article, the
investigating officer shall provide a verbal and written warning to cease such
unlawful conduct and a verbal and written referral for possible alternatives to
their present camping practices, such as, (without limitation), transportation,
shelter, and/or contact information to public or private agencies who may be
able to provide services or support. Any public or private entities who wish to
assist the Hamel Police Department ("Department") in effectively and humanely
transitioning individuals from unauthorized encampments on public property to
an environment consistent with Village ordinances should contact the Department
with a description of what services they can provide and effective contact
information. The Department will develop and maintain a policy to include
procedural guidance regarding the implementation of this Article. The
Department shall consult relevant professional resources and engage interested
community members, service providers, or other willing public or private
entities when designing and implementing this policy. The policy shall be
published and implemented no later than six (6) months after the passage of
this Article. The policy shall provide for the collection of relevant data that
shall be used to review and revise the manual every three (3) years, or as
needed. Said revision shall be made in the same manner the policy is developed.
   (B)   Police shall exercise discretion to ensure that individuals are not
cited for violating this Article due only to a true personal necessity that
requires their present unauthorized camping practices. When possible, the
Department may work directly with community members, service providers or other
willing public or private entities to determine whether a true personal
necessity exists in a particular circumstance. The Department shall provide
specific support, guidance and contacts for officers. But it shall be evidence
that no true personal necessity exists if the individual who is camping refuses
to take advantage of proffered alternatives to their present camping practices
(which could include, in the most extreme cases, short term use of another
location more easily monitored by the police).
   (C)   Upon a determination by law enforcement that an area constitutes an
unauthorized encampment, regardless of whether an individual is cited for a
violation of this Article, Village officials shall have the right to remove any
debris, contraband, or personal property that creates a legitimate health and
safety concern, or that creates an immediate and substantial danger to the
environment. No warning is required prior to such confiscation relating to
health and safety concerns.
   (D)   Materials confiscated pursuant to this Article that are unsanitary or
a danger to the health and safety of any person may be immediately disposed of.
Otherwise, the Department shall provide 24-hour written notice prior to
confiscating property. The Department shall retain personal property
confiscated pursuant to this Article in a manner consistent with the handling
of other confiscated property and must not dispose of such personal property
for a period of at least 30 calendar days, during which time the owner may
retrieve such property from the Department, pursuant to the procedure outlined
in the policy. Nothing prevents Department members from disposing of property
with the consent of the property owner. When Department members have received
consent to dispose of property, Village officials shall assist Department
members when necessary.
(Ord. No. 24-013; 8-13-24)
27-16-5 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person who violates a provision of this Article may be punished by

   (B)   Any person who commits a subsequent violation of this Article,
occurring within one year of a violation, may be punished by a fine of no more
than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). All fines under this Article may be
satisfied by cash payment or community service.
   (C)   Each occurrence of a violation of this Article or, in the case of a
continuous violation, each day a violation occurs or continues, constitutes a
separate offense and shall be punishable separately.

CHAPTER 29
PROPERTY MAINTENANCE CODE
ARTICLE I - ADMINISTRATION
DIVISION I - GENERAL
29-1-1 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as the Property Maintenance Code of the
Village of Hamel, hereinafter referred to as "this Code". (101.1)
29-1-2 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this Code shall apply to all existing residential and
nonresidential structures and all existing premises and constitute minimum
requirements and standards for premises, structures, equipment and facilities
for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation, protection from the
elements, life safety, safety from fire and other hazards, and for safe and
sanitary maintenance; the responsibility of owners, operators and occupants;
the occupancy of existing structures and premises, and for administration,
enforcement and penalties. (101.2)
   [This Section establishes the broad purpose of the Code—to protect the
public health, safety and welfare in both existing residential and
nonresidential structures and on all existing premises.
   Four specific areas are addressed in greater detail in subsequent sections:
   (1)      Establishing minimum maintenance standards for such elements as
basic equipment, light, ventilation, heating, sanitation and fire safety.
   (2)      Fixing responsibility among owners, operators and occupants for
following the Code.
   (3)      Regulating the use of existing structures and premises.
   (4)      Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
   These four categories provide communities with the tools to reduce risks
created by deteriorated or unsafe buildings and help communities upgrade and
maintain other existing structures.]
29-1-3 INTENT.
   This Code shall be construed to secure its expressed intent, which is to
ensure public health, safety and welfare insofar as they are affected by the
continued occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. Existing
structures and premises that do not comply with these provisions shall be
altered or repaired to provide a minimum level of health and safety as required
herein. Repairs, alterations, additions to and change of occupancy in existing
buildings shall comply with the International Existing Building Code. (101.3)
   [This Code is intended to provide requirements addressing the public health,
safety and welfare as they relate to the use and maintenance of existing
structures and premises. The Code requires existing structures and premises
that are not in compliance with the Code to be altered or repaired to meet the
Code. The Code requirements are intended to represent the minimum acceptable
level of public health and safety. The International Existing Building Code®
(IEBC®) is listed as the required Code for all repairs, alterations, additions
and change of occupancies to existing structures.]
29-1-4 SEVERABILITY.
   If a section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Code is, for
any reason, held to be unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions of this Code. (101.4)
   [Only invalid sections of the Code (as established by the court of
jurisdiction) can be set aside. This is essential to safeguard the application
of the Code text to situations whereby a provision of the Code is declared
illegal or unconstitutional. This Section would preserve the legislative action
that put the legal provisions in place.]
DIVISION II - APPLICABILITY
29-1-5 GENERAL.
   The provisions of this Code shall apply to all matters affecting or relating
to structures and premises, as set forth in Division I. Where, in a specific
case, different sections of this Code specify different requirements, the most
restrictive shall govern. (102.1)
29-1-6 MAINTENANCE.
   Equipment, systems, devices and safeguards required by this Code or a
previous regulation or Code under which the structure or premises was
constructed, altered or repaired shall be maintained in good working order. No
owner, operator or occupant shall cause any service, facility, equipment or
utility which is required under this Section to be removed from or shut off
from or discontinued for any occupied dwelling, except for such temporary
interruption as necessary while repairs or alterations are in progress. The
requirements of this Code are not intended to provide the basis for removal or
abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and devices in existing
structures. Except as otherwise specified herein, the owner or the owner’s
designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of buildings,
structures and premises. (102.2)
   [This Section contains general maintenance requirements. The Code
specifically prohibits the disconnection of any required utilities for an
occupied dwelling. This helps to safeguard persons who have a physical
condition and are dependent on these systems. Some examples of this include: a
person who has to have electricity to power a kidney dialysis machine; a
patient who is on an oxygen system full time; or someone with particularly bad
allergies who needs to have an air-conditioning system to help filter the air.
Any safety system that exists in a building must be maintained. A fire
protection or safety system is not to be removed from a building if it is
required by the Code or a previous regulation or code that was in effect when
the building was built. This Section also specifies that the owner or the
owner’s agent is responsible for maintenance, not the tenants of rental
property.]
29-1-7 APPLICATION OF OTHER CODES.
   Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy,
shall be done in accordance with the procedures and provisions of the
International Existing Building Code, International Fuel Gas Code,
International Mechanical Code, and International Electrical Code. Nothing in
this Code shall be construed to cancel, modify or set aside any provision of
the Municipal Zoning Code. (102.3)
29-1-8 EXISTING REMEDIES.

existing remedies of the jurisdiction or its officers or agencies relating to
the removal or demolition of any structure which is dangerous, unsafe and
unsanitary. (102.4)
29-1-9 WORKMANSHIP.
   Repairs, maintenance work, alterations or installations which are caused
directly or indirectly by the enforcement of this Code shall be executed and
installed in a workmanlike manner and installed in accordance with the
manufacturer’s installation instructions. (102.5)
29-1-10 HISTORIC BUILDINGS.
   The provisions of this Code shall not be mandatory for existing buildings or
structures designated as historic buildings when such buildings or structures
are judged by the Code Official to be safe and in the public interest of
health, safety and welfare. (102.6)
29-1-11 REFERENCED CODES AND STANDARDS.
   The codes and standards referenced in this Coe shall be those that are
listed in Article VIII and considered part of the requirements of this Code to
the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where differences occur between
provisions of this Code and the referenced standards, the provisions of this
Code shall apply. (102.7)
29-1-12 REQUIREMENTS NOT COVERED BY CODE.
   Requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation of an
existing fixture, structure or equipment, or for the public safety, health and
general welfare not specifically covered by this Code shall be determined by
the Code Official. (102.8)

executive official in charge thereof shall be known as the Code Official.
(103.1)
29-1-15 APPOINTMENT.
   The Code Official shall be appointed by the Mayor with the advice and
consent of the Village Board; and the Code Official shall not be removed from

the concurrence of the appointing authority, the Code Official shall have the
authority to appoint a deputy code official, other related technical officers,

Code, while acting for the jurisdiction, shall not thereby be rendered liable
personally, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage
accruing to persons or property as a result of an act required or permitted in
the discharge of official duties.
   Any suit instituted against any officer or employee because of an act
performed by that officer or employee in the lawful discharge of duties and
under the provisions of this Code shall be defended by the legal representative
of the jurisdiction until the final termination of the proceedings. The Code
Official or any subordinate shall not be liable for costs in an action, suit or
proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the provisions of this Code; and
any officer of the department of property maintenance inspection, acting in
good faith and without malice, shall be free from liability for acts performed
under any of its provisions or by reason of any act or omission in the
performance of official duties in connection therewith. (103.4)
29-1-18 FEES.
   The fees for activities and services performed by the department in carrying
out its responsibilities under this Code shall be as indicated in the following
schedule. (103.5)
29-1-19  -  29-1-20 RESERVED.
DIVISION IV – DUTIES AND POWERS OF THE CODE OFFICIAL
29-1-21 GENERAL.
   The Code Official shall enforce the provisions of this Code. (104.1)
29-1-22 RULE-MAKING AUTHORITY.
   The Code Official shall have authority as necessary in the interest of
public health, safety and general welfare, to adopt and promulgate rules and
procedures; to interpret and implement the provisions of this Code; to secure
the intent thereof; and to designate requirements applicable because of local
climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not have the effect of waiving
structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided for in this
Code, or of violating accepted engineering methods involving public safety.
(104.2)
29-1-23 INSPECTIONS.
   The Code Official shall make all of the required inspections, or shall
accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. All reports
of such inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible
officer of such approved agency or by the responsible individual. The Code
Official is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to
report upon unusual technical issues that arise, subject to the approval of the
appointing authority. (104.3)
29-1-24 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Code Official is authorized to enter the structure or premises at
reasonable times to inspect subject to constitutional restrictions on
unreasonable searches and seizures. If entry is refused or not obtained, the
Code Official is authorized to pursue recourse as provided by law. (104.4)
   [This Section establishes the right of the Code Official to enter the
premises in order to make the inspections required by Section
29-1-23. The right to enter structures or premises is limited. First, to
protect the right of privacy, the owner or occupant must grant the Code
Official permission before an interior inspection of the property can be
conducted. Permission is not required for inspections that can be accomplished
from within the public right-of-way. Second, such access may be denied by the
owner or occupant. Unless the inspector has reasonable cause to believe that a
violation of the Code exists, access may be unattainable. Third, Code Officials
must present proper identification and request admittance during reasonable
hours—usually the normal business hours of the establishment—to be admitted.
Fourth, inspections must be aimed at securing or determining compliance with
the provisions and intent of the regulations that are specifically within the
established scope of the Code Official’s authority.
   Searches of a private residence to gather information for the purpose of
enforcing codes, ordinances or regulations are considered unreasonable and are
prohibited by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. “Reasonable cause”
in the context of this Section must be distinguished from “probable cause”,
which is required to gain access to property in criminal cases. The burden of
proof establishing reasonable cause may vary among jurisdictions. Usually, an
inspector must show that the property is subject to inspection under the
provisions of the Code; that the interests of the public health, safety and
welfare outweigh the individual’s right to maintain privacy; and that such an
inspection is required solely to determine compliance with the provisions of
the Code.
   Many jurisdictions do not recognize the concept of an administrative warrant
and may require the Code Official to prove probable or reasonable cause in
order to gain access upon refusal. This burden of proof is usually more
substantial, often requiring the Code Official to stipulate in advance why
access is needed (usually access is restricted to gathering evidence for
seeking an indictment or making an arrest), what specific items or information
is sought, its relevance to the case against the individual subject, how
knowledge of the relevance of the information or items sought was obtained and
how the evidence sought will be used. In all such cases, the right to privacy
must always be weighed against the right of the Code Official to conduct an
inspection to verify that the public health, safety and welfare are not in
jeopardy. Such important and complex constitutional issues should be discussed
with the jurisdiction’s legal counsel. Jurisdictions should establish
procedures for securing the necessary court orders when an inspection is deemed
necessary following a refusal.]
29-1-25 IDENTIFICATION.
   The Code Official shall carry proper identification when inspecting
structures or premises in the performance of duties under this Code. (104.5)
29-1-26 NOTICES AND ORDERS.
   The Code Official shall issue all necessary notices or orders to ensure
compliance with this Code. (104.6)
29-1-27 DEPARTMENT RECORDS.
   The Code Official shall keep official records of all business and activities
of the department specified in the provisions of this Code. Such records shall
be retained in the official records as long as the building or structure to
which such records relate remains in existence, unless otherwise provided for
by other regulations. (104.7)
29-1-28 COORDINATION OF INSPECTIONS.
   Whenever in the enforcement of this Code or another code or ordinance, the
responsibility of more than one code official of the jurisdiction is involved,
it shall be the duty of the code officials involved to coordinate their
inspections and administrative orders as fully as practicable so that the
owners and occupants of the structure shall not be subjected to visits by
numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders. Whenever an inspector
from any agency or department observes an apparent or actual violation of some
provision of some law, ordinance or code not within the inspector’s authority
to enforce, the inspector shall report the findings to the Code Official having
jurisdiction. (104.8)
29-1-29 RESERVED.
DIVISION V - APPROVAL
29-1-30 MODIFICATIONS.
   Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the
provisions of this Code, the Code Official shall have the authority to grant
modifications for individual cases, provided the Code Official shall first find
that special individual reason makes the strict letter of this Code impractical
and the modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of this Code
and that such modification does not lessen health, life and fire safety
requirements. The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded
and entered in the department files. (105.1)
29-1-31 ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS, METHODS AND EQUIPMENT.
   The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the installation of
any material or to prohibit any method of construction not specifically
prescribed by this Code, provided that any such alternative has been approved.
An alternative material or method of construction shall be approved where the
Code Official finds that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with
the intent of the provisions of this Code, and that the material, method or
work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the equivalent of that
prescribed in this Code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability and safety. (105.2)
29-1-32 REQUIRED TESTING.
   Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the provisions of
this Code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the
requirements of this Code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative
materials or methods, the Code Official shall have the authority to require
tests to be made as evidence of compliance at no expense to the jurisdiction.
(105.3)
   (A)   Test Methods.
   Test methods shall be as specified in this Code or by other recognized test
standards. In the absence of recognized and accepted test methods, the Code
Official shall be permitted to approve appropriate testing procedures performed
by an approved agency. (105.3.1)
   (B)   Test Reports.
   Reports of tests shall be retained by the Code Official for the period
required for retention of public records. (105.3.2)
29-1-33 MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT REUSE.
   Materials, equipment and devices shall not be reused unless such elements
are in good repair or have been reconditioned and tested when necessary, placed
in good and proper working condition and approved. (105.4)
29-1-34 RESERVED.
DIVISION VI - VIOLATIONS
29-1-35 UNLAWFUL ACTS.
   It shall be unlawful for a person, firm or corporation to be in conflict
with or in violation of any of the provisions of this Code. (106.1)
29-1-36 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   The Code Official shall serve a notice of violation or order in accordance
with Division VII. (106.2)
29-1-37 PROSECUTION OF VIOLATION.
   Any person failing to comply with a notice of violation or order served in
accordance with Division VII shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and the
violation shall be deemed a strict liability offense. If the notice of
violation is not complied with, the Code Official shall institute the
appropriate proceeding at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate such
violation, or to require the removal or termination of the unlawful occupancy
of the structure in violation of the provisions of this Code or of the order or
direction made pursuant thereto. Any action taken by the authority having
jurisdiction on such premises shall be charged against the real estate upon
which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.
(106.3)
29-1-38 VIOLATION PENALTIES.
   Any person who shall violate a provision of this Code, or fail to comply
therewith, or with any of the requirements thereof, shall be prosecuted within
the limits provided by Section
1-1-20. Each day that a violation continues after due notice has been served
shall be deemed a separate offense. (106.4)
29-1-39 ABATEMENT OF VIOLATION.
   The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not preclude the
legal officer of the jurisdiction from instituting appropriate action to
restrain, correct or abate a violation, or to prevent illegal occupancy of a
building, structure or premises, or to stop an illegal act, conduct, business
or utilization of the building, structure or premises. (106.5)
   [Despite the assessment of a penalty in the form of a fine against a
violator, the violation itself must still be corrected. Failure to make the
necessary corrections will result in the violator being subject to additional
penalties as described in the proceeding section.]
29-1-40 RESERVED.
DIVISION VII – NOTICES AND ORDERS
29-1-41 NOTICE TO PERSON RESPONSIBLE.
   Whenever the Code Official determines that there has been a violation of
this Code or has grounds to believe that a violation has occurred, notice shall
be given in the manner prescribed in Sections
29-1-42 and
29-1-43 to the person responsible for the violation as specified in this Code.
Notices for condemnation procedures shall also comply with Section
29-1-49. (107.1)
29-1-42 FORM.
   Such notice prescribed in Section
29-1-41 shall be in accordance with all of the following:
   (A)   Be in writing.
   (B)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification.
   (C)   Include a statement of the violation or violations and why the notice
is being issued.
   (D)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time to make the
repairs and improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into
compliance with the provisions of this Code.
   (E)   Inform the property owner of the right to appeal.
   (F)   Include a statement of the right to file a lien in accordance with
Section
29-1-37.
(107.2)
29-1-43 METHOD OF SERVICE.
   Such notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:
   (A)   delivered personally;
   (B)   sent by certified or first-class mail addressed to the last known
address; or
   (C)   if the notice is returned showing that the letter was not delivered, a
copy thereof shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the structure
affected by such notice.
   All of the services noted above may be expensive and time consuming. In some
communities, the courts may consider service to be valid if the notice was sent
to the last known address of the owner or owner’s agent by regular postage and
the notice was not returned by the post office. This method of service is
obviously much cheaper and usually faster than waiting for the return of a
certified letter. It must, however, be acceptable to the court system. The
jurisdiction’s attorney should be consulted to determine that the type of
service is legally acceptable, reasonably cost effective and timely. (107.3)
29-1-44 PENALTIES.
   Penalties for noncompliance with orders and notices shall be as set forth in
Section
29-1-38. (107.4)
29-1-45 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dwelling unit or structure who has
received a compliance order or upon whom a notice of violation has been served
to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of such dwelling unit
or structure to another until the provisions of the compliance order or notice
of violation have been complied with, or until such owner shall first furnish
the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any compliance
order or notice of violation issued by the Code Official and shall furnish to
the Code Official a signed and notarized statement from the grantee,
transferee, mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such compliance
order or notice of violation and fully accepting the responsibility without
condition for making the corrections or repairs required by such compliance
order or notice of violation. (107.5)
   [When a property has a pending violation order, it is unlawful for an owner
to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of the property without
either following the order or advising the buyer, mortgagee, etc., of the
pending violation. The owner must prove that the buyer has received notice of
pending violations by providing the Code Official with a signed, notarized
receipt from the new transferee.
   Determining who is the current owner of a building is a frustrating and
difficult activity. To evade code enforcement action, owners will frequently
transfer ownership of their property. This provision of the Code permits the
Code Official to cite the seller if he or she did not provide the Code Official
with the required notification when the property was transferred; thus, even
though the seller may avoid complying with the outstanding violation orders, he
or she can still be charged with a violation for failing to provide proof that
the transferee was aware of the pending orders.]
29-1-46 RESERVED.
DIVISION VIII - - UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT
29-1-47 GENERAL.
   When a structure or equipment is found by the Code Official to be unsafe, or
when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy, or is found unlawful, such
structure shall be condemned pursuant to the provisions of this Code. (108.1)
   [This Section provides a brief description of conditions where the Code
Official is given the authority to condemn an existing structure or equipment.
Where a structure or equipment is “unlawful”, as described in the text of this
Section, that structure or equipment does not comply with the requirements of
the Code. The deficiencies are such that an unsafe condition or a condition
that is unfit for human occupancy exists.]
   (A)      Unsafe Structures.
   An unsafe structure is one that is found to be dangerous to the life,
health, property or safety of the public or the occupants of the structure by
not providing minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of
fire, or because such structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged,
decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of such faulty construction or
unstable foundation, that partial or complete collapse is possible. (108.1.1)
   (B)      Unsafe Equipment.
   Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment, elevator, moving
stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers or other
equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such disrepair or
condition that such equipment is a hazard to life, health, property or safety
of the public or occupants of the premises or structure. (108.1.2)
   (C)      Structure Unfit for Human Occupancy. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the Code Official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this Code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public. (108.1.3)
   (D)      Unlawful Structure.
   An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be occupied by
more persons than permitted under this Code, or was erected, altered or
occupied contrary to law. (108.1.4)
   [An unlawful structure is one that has serious deficiencies such that an
unsafe condition or a condition that is unfit for human occupancy exists. An
unlawful structure does not mean one where there are criminal activities.]
29-1-48 CLOSING OF VACANT STRUCTURES.
   If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and occupancy, and
is not in danger of structural collapse, the Code Official is authorized to
post a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed
up so as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close
up the premises within the time specified in the order, the Code Official shall
cause the premises to be closed and secured through any available public agency
or by contract or arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be
charged against the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall
be a lien upon such real estate and may be collected by any other legal
resource. (108.2)
29-1-49 NOTICE.
   Whenever the Code Official has condemned a structure or equipment under the
provisions of this Section, notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or
about the structure affected by such notice and served on the owner or the
person or persons responsible for the structure or equipment in accordance with
Section
29-1-43. If the notice pertains to equipment, it shall also be placed on the
condemned equipment. The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section
29-1-42.
29-1-50 PLACARDING.
   Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply with the notice
provisions within the time given, the Code Official shall post on the premises
or on defective equipment, a placard bearing the word "Condemned" and a
statement of the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the
equipment or removing the placard. (108.4)
   (A)   Placard Removal.
   The Code Official shall remove the condemnation placard whenever the defect
or defects upon which the condemnation and placarding action were based have
been eliminated. Any person who defaces or removes a condemnation placard
without the approval of the Code Official shall be subject to the penalties
provided by this Code. (108.4.1)
   [Only the Code Official is authorized to remove a condemnation placard. The
Code Official is to remove the placard only when the defect or defects have
been corrected as required by the Code. Any other person who removes or defaces
a placard is in violation of the Code and subject to its penalties.]
29-1-51 PROHIBITED OCCUPANCY.
   Any occupied structure condemned and placarded by the Code Official shall be
vacated as ordered by the Code Official. Any person who shall occupy a
placarded premises or shall operate placarded equipment, and any owner or any
person responsible for the premises who shall let anyone occupy a placarded
premises or operate placarded equipment shall be liable for the penalties
provided by this Code. (108.5)
29-1-52  -  29-1-59 RESERVED.
DIVISION IX - EMERGENCY MEASURES
29-1-60 IMMINENT DANGER.
   When, in the opinion of the Code Official, there is imminent damage of
failure or collapse of a building or structure which endangers life, or when
any structure or part of a structure has fallen and life is endangered by the
occupation of the structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the
building, occupants or those in the proximity of any structure because of
explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or
materials, or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the Code Official
is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate
the premises forthwith. The Code Official shall cause to be posted at each
entrance to such structure a notice reading as follows: "This Structure is
Unsafe and its Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Code Official." It shall be
unlawful for any person to enter such structure except for the purpose of
securing the structure, making the required repairs, removing the hazardous
condition, or of demolishing the same. (109.1)
29-1-61 TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Code, whenever, in the opinion of
the Code Official, there is imminent danger due to an unsafe condition, the
Code Official shall order the necessary work to be done, including the
boarding-up of openings, to render such structure temporarily safe whether or
not the legal procedure herein described has been instituted; and shall cause
such other action to be taken as the Code Official deems necessary to meet such
emergency. (109.2)
29-1-62 CLOSING STREETS.
   When necessary for public safety, the Code Official shall temporarily close
structures and close, or order the authority having jurisdiction to close,
sidewalks, streets, public ways and places adjacent to unsafe structures, and
prohibit the same from being utilized. (109.3)
29-1-63 EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   For the purposes of this Section, the Code Official shall employ the
necessary labor and materials to perform the required work as expeditiously as
possible. (109.4)
29-1-64 COSTS OF EMERGENCY REPAIRS.
   Costs incurred in the performance of emergency work shall be paid by the
jurisdiction. The legal counsel of the jurisdiction shall institute appropriate
action against the owner of the premises where the unsafe structure is or was
located for the recovery of such costs. (109.5)
29-1-65 HEARING.
   Any person ordered to take emergency measures shall comply with such order
forthwith. Any affected person shall thereafter, upon petition directed to the
appeals boards, be afforded a hearing as described in this Code. (109.6)
29-1-66 RESERVED.
DIVISION X - DEMOLITION
29-1-67 GENERAL.
   The Code Official shall order the owner of any premises upon which is
located any structure, which in the Code Official's judgement is so old,
dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe,
unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation or occupancy, and such that
it is unreasonable to repair the structure, to demolish and remove such
structure; or if such structure is capable of being made safe by repairs, to
repair and make safe and sanitary or to demolish and remove at the owner’s
option; or where there has been a cessation of normal construction of any
structure for a period of more than two (2) years, to demolish and remove such
structure. (110.1)
29-1-68 NOTICES AND ORDERS.
   All notices and orders shall comply with Division VII. (110.2)
   [Before the Code Official can pursue action to demolish a building in
accordance with Section
29-1-67 or
29-1-69, it is imperative that all owners and any other persons with a recorded
encumbrance on the property be given proper notice of the demolition plans (See
Division VII for notice and order requirements).]
29-1-69 FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   If the owner of a premises fails to comply with a demolition order within
the time prescribed, the Code Official shall cause the structure to be
demolished and removed, either through an available public agency or by
contract or arrangement with private persons, and the cost of such demolition
and removal shall be charged against the real estate upon which the structure
is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate. (110.3)
29-1-70 SALVAGE MATERIALS.
   When any structure has been ordered demolished and removed, the governing
body or other designated officer under said contract or arrangement aforesaid
shall have the right to sell the salvage and valuable materials at the highest
price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after deducting the expenses
of such demolition and removal, shall be promptly remitted with a report of
such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and amounts deducted,
for the person who is entitled thereto, subject to any order of a court. If
such a surplus does not remain to be turned over, the report shall so state.

DIVISION XI - MEANS OF APPEAL
29-1-72 APPLICATION FOR APPEAL.
   Any person directly affected by a decision of the Code Official or a notice
or order issued under this Code shall have the right to appeal to the Board of
Appeals, provided that a written application for appeal is filed within twenty
(20) days after the day the decision, notice or order was served. An
application for appeal shall be based on a claim that the true intent of this
Code or the rules legally adopted thereunder have been incorrectly interpreted,
the provisions of this Code do not fully apply, or the requirements of this
Code are adequately satisfied by other means. (111.1)

   The Board of Appeals shall consist of a minimum of three (3) members who are
qualified by experience and training to pass on matters pertaining to property
maintenance and who are not employees or elected officials of this
municipality. The Code Official shall be an ex-officio member but shall have no
vote on any matter before the Board. The Board shall be appointed by the Mayor
with the advice and consent of the Village Board, and shall serve staggered and
overlapping terms. (111.2)
   (A)   Alternate Members.

placed upon these funds in coping with a particular disaster are unreasonably
great, and the Governor has proclaimed the municipality a disaster, he may make
application for funds from the state disaster relief fund. If monies available
from the fund are insufficient, and if the Mayor finds that other sources of
money to cope with the disaster are not available or are insufficient, he shall
issue a call for an immediate session of the Village Board for the purpose of
enacting ordinances as the Village Board may deem necessary to transfer and
expend monies appropriated for other purposes, or borrow monies from the United
States Government or other public or private sources. If less than a quorum of

Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing or terminating a local disaster
emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity, and shall be filed
promptly with the municipal clerk.
   (B)   The effect of a declaration of a local disaster emergency is to
activate any and all applicable local emergency operations plans and to
authorize the furnishing of aid and assistance thereunder.
   (C)   During a local disaster emergency, the Mayor may suspend the
provisions of any municipal ordinance prescribing procedures for the conduct of
municipal business, or the orders, rules and regulations of any municipal
agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any ordinance, rule or
regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping
with the emergency, as authorized by “The Illinois Emergency Management Agency
Act”, provided that, if the Village Board meets at such time, he shall act
subject to the directions and restrictions imposed by that body.

with other public agencies within his immediate vicinity, develop or cause to
be developed mutual aid arrangements with other political subdivisions,
municipal corporations or bodies politic within this state for reciprocal
disaster response and recovery in case a disaster is too great to be dealt with
unassisted. The mutual aid shall not, however, be effective unless and until
approved by each of such political subdivisions, municipal corporations or
bodies politic as are parties thereto, in the manner provided by law, and
unless and until filed with and approved in writing by the state director. Such
arrangements shall be consistent with the state and local emergency management
operations plan and program, and in the event of such disaster as described in
Section
30-3-3 of this Code, it shall be the duty of each local and department for
emergency management operations to render assistance in accordance with the
provisions of such mutual aid arrangements.
30-3-10 COMMUNICATIONS.
   The local Emergency Management Agency shall ascertain what means exist for
rapid and efficient communications in times of disaster emergencies. The agency
shall consider the desirability of supplementing these communications resources
or of integrating them into a comprehensive system or network. In studying the
character and feasibility of any system or its several parts, the agency shall
evaluate the possibility of multipurpose use thereof for general municipal and
local governmental purposes. The agency shall make recommendations to the Mayor
as appropriate.
30-3-11 IMMUNITY.
   Neither the municipality, the agency or any member thereof or any person

disaster activities, while complying with or attempting to comply with this
Code or any rule or regulations promulgated pursuant to this Code is liable for

competent to practice any profession, trade or occupation are required in this
municipality to cope with the disaster situation and it appears that the number
of persons licensed or registered in this municipality to practice such
profession, trade or occupation may be insufficient for such purpose, then any

SECTION 1: INFORMATION FOR NEW EMPLOYEES
1.1   VILLAGE OF HAMEL INTRODUCTION
Whether you have just joined our staff or have been with the Village for a
while, we are confident that you will find the Village a dynamic and rewarding
place in which to work, and we look forward to a productive and successful
association. We consider the employees of the Village to be one of its most
valuable resources. This Handbook has been written to serve as the guide for
the Village/employee relationship.
No employee handbook can answer every question or anticipate every situation.
For that reason, the Village Board may interpret, change, supplement, or
rescind any part of this Handbook or any of its other policies from as it deems
appropriate, with or without prior notice. This Handbook supersedes any earlier
policy statements concerning the matters described in this Handbook or any oral
statements made at any time during your employment. Nothing in this Handbook or
in any of the Village’s policies, practices, or representations to or about its
employees is an express or implied contract. Your employment is not for any
specific time and may be terminated at will, with or without cause, and without
any prior notice by the Village. You may also resign for any reason at any
time. No supervisor or representative of the Village has the authority to enter
into any agreement for employment for any specified period of time or to make
any agreement contrary to the above. The only person that has the authority to
enter into a written agreement with an employee is the Village President. If
you have a written employment agreement signed by the Village President and a
statement in this Handbook conflicts with the terms of that employment
agreement, the terms of the employee agreement govern.
The procedure, practices, policies and benefits described here may be modified
and discontinued from time to time. We will try to inform you of any changes
that may occur.
1.2   SCOPE
This Employee Handbook applies to all regular and full-time employees, as well
as, employees employed by the police department. The Village will mention from
time to time when a policy or practice may be slightly different for employees
who are working under contract terms. Whenever the policies, terms, conditions
or language of this Handbook are in conflict with a contract, the policies,
terms, conditions and language of the contract supersede those of the Handbook.
1.3   ADOPTION AND POLICY AMENDMENT
These policies and procedures are adopted by resolution of the Village Board.
Policy amendments shall become effective upon consideration and adoption by the
Village Board.
1.4   EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL AND DISCLAIMER
The contents of this Handbook are presented as a matter of information only.
This Handbook does not, either by itself or in conjunction with any other
Village documents policy, procedure action, practice or verbal statement
creating an employment contract, express or implied. The Village reserves the
right to modify, revoke, suspend, terminate, or change any or all procedures
contained herein in whole or in part at any time with or without prior notice.
All employees are employed “at-will” and can be terminated at any time with or
without cause without prior notice, except as otherwise provided by law. No
employee has any authority to modify the “at-will” status of any employee
unless that modification is expressly made in writing and has been specifically
agreed to in writing by the Village Board.
1.5   EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
The Village affirms its commitment to providing Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) for all employees and applicants of the Village. No personnel decision or
action shall be unlawfully influenced in any manner by consideration of an
individual’s race, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, age,
disability, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity, genetic
information, or status as a covered veteran or any other characteristic
protected under applicable federal, state, or local law.
The Village expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment based
on race, color, religion, creed, sex, marital status, gender identity, sexual
orientation, national origin, age, genetic information, disability, veteran
status, or any other protected characteristic. Improper interference with the
ability of the Village employees to perform their expected job duties is
absolutely not tolerated.
1.6   EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES
All employees are designated as either non-exempt or exempt under state and
federal wage and hour laws. The following is intended to help employees
understand employment classifications and employment status. These
classifications do not guarantee employment for any specified period of time.
The right to terminate the employment-at-will relationship at any time is
retained by both the employee and the Village.
Non-exempt employees - are employees whose work is covered by the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA). They are NOT exempt from the law’s requirements
concerning minimum wage and overtime.
Exempt employees - are generally managers or professional, administrative or
technical staff who ARE exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of
the FLSA. Exempt employees hold jobs that meet the standards and criteria
established under the FLSA by the U.S. Department of Labor.
1.7   PROBATIONARY PERIOD
The first six (6) months of employment are a time for the Village and the
employee to get to know one another. If during the probationary period it is
determined that the employee does not fulfill the requirements of his/her
employment or if the Village determines that continued employment is not in the
interest of the Village, the employee will be terminated.
Following a break or breaks in service totaling more than two (2) weeks, a
regular employee’s probationary period shall be extended by a period equal to
the break in service.
Prior to the end of the probationary period, the supervisor shall complete a
written performance evaluation for the employee. Continuance in the position
after expiration of the probationary period shall constitute regular
employment. However, completion of the probationary period does not alter the
at-will status of the employment relationship.
1.8   BACKGROUND AND REFERENCE CHECKS
To ensure that individuals who join the Village are well qualified and to
ensure that the Village maintains a safe and productive work environment, it is
the Village’s policy to conduct pre-employment background checks on all
applicants who accept an offer of employment.
All offers of employment are conditioned on receipt of a background check
report that is acceptable to the Village. All background checks are conducted
in conformity with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and all other applicable
state and federal laws. Reports are kept confidential and are only viewed by
individuals involved in the hiring process.
If information obtained in a background check may lead the Village to question
whether to deny employment on the basis of the report, a copy of the report
will be provided to the applicant, and the applicant will have the opportunity
to dispute the report prior to any decision being made as to whether to deny
employment on the basis of the report.
At any time during employment, additional checks, such as driving record or
credit report, may be made if appropriate and job related.
1.9   EMPLOYMENT OF RELATIVES
The Village wants to ensure that Village practices do not create conflict of
interest or favoritism. This extends to practices that involve employee hiring,
promotion and transfer. Close relatives, partners, those in a dating
relationship, and members of the same household are not permitted to be in
positions that have a reporting responsibility to each other.
SECTION 2: RULES & STANDARDS
In order to ensure that all employees are properly paid, the Village has
established the following timekeeping and pay policies. Violations of these
policies may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
2.1   WORKING HOURS AND TIME KEEPING
The Village keeps regular business hours Monday through Friday. The Police
Department schedule is not regular and dependent upon the needs of the Village.
The standard full-time schedule for non-exempt employees is eight (8), ten
(10), and twelve (12) hours per work day. Extra work hours may be required to
meet the needs of the Village. Compensation of overtime hours worked will be
made in accordance with the Wage and Hour Provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act.
Maintaining Time Sheets
All employees required to maintain time sheets are responsible for accurately
and honestly recording their hours worked. Falsifying a time sheet is a
violation of Village policy. The Village prohibits supervisors from directing
employees to report less than all hours worked, i.e., to work “off the clock.”
Overtime
From time to time, non-exempt employees may be required to work overtime, for
which they will receive overtime pay or comp time in accordance with applicable
wage and hour laws. Employees who work more than a eighty (80) hours in a
normal pay period, shall be compensated one and one half (1-½) times the basic
straight time wage for all time worked in excess of eighty (80) hours per
normal pay period or receive one and one half ( ½) hours comp time for every
hour of overtime worked, not to exceed a total of twenty (20) cumulative hours.
In calculating the hours worked for overtime purposes, the following is
included in hours worked: vacation, holidays, approved paid sick days and jury
duty.
Except in unforeseen and emergency situations, employees should not work
overtime without prior approval from their supervisors. All overtime worked
must be reported, whether it is pre-approved or not pre-approved.
Procedure for Pay Discrepancies
Although the Village makes every effort to ensure that employees are properly
paid, all employees should review their paycheck stub to confirm that they have
been paid the correct amount, received all overtime pay due, and not been
subject to improper deductions. If an employee believes that he or she has not
been paid the proper amount or has been instructed to falsify a time sheet, the
employee should promptly report the matter to the Chief of Police, Mayor or
Village Clerk, so the matter can be investigated or reviewed and any necessary
corrective action taken. No employee will be subject to retaliation because he
or she makes such a report in good faith.
2.2   ATTENDANCE
The Village depends on employees to come to work when scheduled, to arrive on
time, and not to leave work earlier than scheduled. Regular and timely
attendance is an expected and essential part of every position with the
Village. Employees should telephone the Chief of Police or Village Clerk’s
Office of an unexpected absence. Unexpected absences should be reported no
later than two (2) hours before the shift on the day of the absence. If no one
is available to receive the report of absence, a voicemail message should be
left on the Department phone. Absent prior authorization from the Mayor or
Chief of Police, or an approved absence such as a prearranged vacation day or
leave of absence, employees are expected to be at work every day scheduled.
Excessive absenteeism, tardiness, or leaving work early, or a suspicious
pattern of such conduct (e.g., repeated absences on a particular day of the
week, sick days repeatedly coupled with a regular day off), may result in
disciplinary action.
2.3   EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION
The Village is committed to ensuring that its employees have access to, and are
provided with relevant information about their job. We aim to keep you informed
about what is happening within to explain the decisions that have been taken
and to listen to your views and ideas. We endeavor to communicate openly and
honestly and to be clear, simple and jargon free.
The supervisors operate an ‘open door’ policy according to which employees are
free to discuss their ideas for the Village or any concerns they may have. We
realize that the best ideas for continued improvement and problem solving come
from those who are closest to the challenges.
2.4   POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT
Positive working relationships are essential to the teamwork that is necessary
to ensure effective delivery of Village service and the well-being of all
employees. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional,
civil, and courteous manner whether interacting with the public or with fellow
employees. Behaviors which tend to create a hostile environment are prohibited.
These include, but are not limited to, rudeness or discourtesy, malicious
gossip, false allegations or providing false information about an employee,
refusal to communicate, including deliberate failure to share necessary job-
related information, and avoidance or “shunning.”
2.5   DRESS AND APPEARANCE
The Village permits business casual and appropriate casual clothing to be worn
in the office. Police Officers are expected to report to work well groomed,
clean, and dressed according to the requirements of their position. When in
doubt whether a particular style or type of dress is appropriate, ask the Chief
of Police. Full-time employees will have a Four Hundred Dollar ($400.00)
clothing allowance, per year. Refer to the Hamel Police Department Policy
Manual, Procedure - 3.104
2.6   PERSONAL PROPERTY
No liability is accepted for loss or damage to any personal property brought
onto Village premises. Employees are requested not to bring personal items of
value into the workplace. Personal items should not be left at the premises
overnight.
2.7   PERSONAL DATA
Personal data is any information, whether held on a computer system or in an
organized paper based filing system which, either on its own or in conjunction
with other information held about you, enables the Village to identify you. The
types of personal data Village will collect about you during your employment
may include any or all of the following: name and address; contact details;
next of kin details; date of birth; education and qualifications; bank account
details; salary information; performance reviews; sickness records, training
records and personal development plans.
We have systems in place to ensure your personal data is stored securely and
dealt with and processed in accordance with recognized good practice.
The Village may disclose your personal data to reputable third parties in order
to carry out the normal management and administration processes associated with
your employment. However, the Village will not disclose or share your personal
data to third parties without your permission, unless this is necessary for the
purposes of your employment or is required by law.
2.8   CHANGES IN PERSONAL DETAILS
Please ensure that you promptly notify a supervisor of any change of address,
marital status, next of kin details, etc., in order that we can maintain
accurate information and make contact with you in an emergency, if necessary
outside of normal business hours.
2.9   ANTI-HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION
The Village is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are
treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a
professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and
prohibits unlawful discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore,
the Village expects that all relationships among persons in the workplace will
be business-like and free of bias, prejudice and harassment.
The Village encourages reporting of all perceived incidents of discrimination
or harassment. It is the policy of the Village to ensure equal employment
opportunity without discrimination or harassment, on the basis of race, color,
religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin,
age, disability, genetic information, marital status, status as a covered
veteran, or any other legally protected characteristic. The Village prohibits
retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment or
who participates in an investigation of such reports.
The prohibitions contained in this policy include all conduct and communication
regardless of the form of that conduct or communication. This means that all
forms of electronic communication, all types of social media, and all forms of
interaction are covered.
Definitions of Harassment
Sexual harassment constitutes discrimination and is illegal under federal,
state and local laws. For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is
defined, as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
written, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when; a) submission to
such a conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
an individual’s employment; b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual; c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive working environment. Sexual harassment may include a range
of subtle and not-so-subtle behaviors and may involve individuals of the same
or different gender. Depending on the circumstances, these behaviors may
include unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors; sexual jokes
and innuendo; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; commentary about an individual’s
body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering, whistling or touching;
insulting or obscene comment or gestures; display in the workplace of sexually
suggestive objects or pictures; and other physical, verbal or visual conduct of
sexual nature.
Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly
prohibited. Under this policy, harassment is verbal, written or physical
conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual
because of his/her race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation,
national origin, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, genetic
information or any other characteristic protected by law or that of his/her
relatives, friends or associates, and that a) has the purpose or effect of
creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment; b) has the
purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work
performance; or c) otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment
opportunities.
Harassing conduct includes epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping;
threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; and written
graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an
individual or group and, whether is placed on walls or displayed elsewhere on
the employer’s premises or otherwise circulated in the workplace, on Village
time or using Village equipment via email, phone (including voice messages),
text messages, tweets, blogs, social networking sites or other means.
The Village prohibits all forms of sexual or other harassment and
discrimination whether involving a single incident or continued harassing
behavior, and whether or not the inappropriate behavior in question rises to
the level of actionable legal harassment or discrimination. Any reported
allegations of harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be investigated
promptly.
Retaliation
No one will be subject to, and the Village strictly prohibits, any form of
discipline, reprisal, intimidation, or retaliation for good faith reporting of
incidents of harassment, discrimination or retaliation of any kind, pursuing
any such claim, or cooperating in related investigations.
Any employee, regardless of position or title, whom the Village determines has
subjected an individual to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in
violation of this policy, will be subject to discipline, up to and including
termination of employment.
Confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process to the
extent consistent with adequate investigation and corrective action.
Misconduct constituting harassment, discrimination or retaliation will be dealt
with appropriately. False or malicious complaints will be subject to
appropriate disciplinary action.
2.10   SOLICITATION AND DISTRIBUTION
The Village prohibits a non-employee from soliciting any of the Village’s
employees during the employee’s working hours. The Village prohibits any
employee from soliciting, collecting from, or selling to any other employee
during working time of the soliciting employee or of the employee being
solicited. “Working time” means the time during which either the solicited
employee should be working but does not include meal times break periods, or
other periods when employees are not actively at work.
2.11   CONDUCT/DISCIPLINARY & PROCEDURES
The orderly and efficient operation of the Village requires that employees
maintain standards of proper conduct and adhere to Village policies and
practices. To that end, the Village has established rules that must be
followed. Most rules involve common sense and accepted standards of good
conduct. The Village considers commission of any of the following or similar
acts serious and grounds for discipline.
First Violation - Verbal Warning (must be documented)
Second Violation - Written Warning
Third Violation - Up to and including suspension or termination
While the list below provides examples of conduct that will result in
discipline, it is not all-inclusive. The Mayor and/or your immediate supervisor
retain the sole discretion to determine appropriate discipline, up to and
including termination, at all times. The Village may utilize whatever level of
discipline it believes is appropriate under the circumstances, including
termination of employment, regardless of whether the employee has been subject
to any prior corrective action or discipline. Conduct that may lead to
immediate discipline includes, but is not limited to:
Supplying false information when applying for employment or at any time during
employment
Altering or falsifying Village documents or records
Misusing confidential information of the Village
Theft or unlawful possession of stolen, lost or mislaid property
Violating the anti-discrimination/harassment policy
Violating the technology policy
Gross negligence or carelessness
Soliciting or receiving gratuities related to employment
Misusing any benefits
Acts of violence-verbal or physical
Excessive tardiness or absenteeism
2.12   DRUG-FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT
This policy is intended to regulate all issues in the use and abuse of alcohol
and controlled substances in the workplace or that affect the workplace (refer
to Codebook Article 7). The Village is dedicated to providing safe, dependable
and efficient services to the citizens of the Village. In meeting this
obligation, it is our policy to ensure that all employees are not impaired in
their abilities to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive and healthy
manner and to create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of
drug abuse. The Village prohibits the unlawful manufacture, distribution,
dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances in the workplace while
on duty, on-call or responding to duty. Violations of this policy can result in
disciplinary action, up and including termination, and may have legal
consequences.
2.13   DISCIPLINARY & GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Any employee who believes that a violation of Policies has occurred, whether by
a Village employee, Village Trustee, or elected official, should inform in
writing, the Mayor, immediate supervisor, or a Village Trustee of a purported
violation. All reports will be referred to the Village Board for investigation,
review, or other appropriate action.
The Village Board or its designee will conduct a prompt investigation or review
of the report and the facts concerning the purported violation. If the Village
Board concludes that the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, discrimination,
harassment or other policies have been violated, it will take prompt corrective
action reasonably designed to end the violation and to prevent any further
violations from occurring. Such corrective action may include disciplinary
action against anyone found to have violated the policy, up to and including
immediate termination.
After the Village has completed its investigation or review and determined
whether this policy has been violated, it will advise the complainant of the
results of the investigation or review and the corrective action, if any, that

proof that the employee has paid for health insurance.
2.15   TECHNOLOGY USE POLICY
E-mail and the internet are powerful communication tools and valuable sources
of information to vendors, municipalities, technology, and services. Likewise,
the telephone, photocopier and fax machine are useful equipment. However, an
employee’s improper use of Village provided e-mail or internet services and
office equipment, can waste time and resources and create embarrassment for
both the Village and the employee.
Employees are strictly prohibited from using Village-provided services and
office equipment in connection with any of the following activities:
Engaging in illegal, fraudulent, or malicious conduct, including sending or
receiving copyrighted materials in violation of copyright laws or licensing
agreements;
Working on behalf of organizations without any professional or business
affiliation with the Village, including profit-making activities that accrue to
the employee;
Use of internet or e-mail devices not authorized by the Village;
Sending, retrieving, or storing offensive, obscene or defamatory material;
Annoying or harassing other individuals;
Sending uninvited e-mail of personal nature or personal activities that incur
additional costs to the Village or interfere with an employee’s performance;
Sending Village proprietary or confidential materials to anyone not entitled to
know or possess them;
Monitoring or intercepting the files or electronic communications of employees
or third parties;
Obtaining unauthorized access to any computer system;
Using another individual’s account or identity without explicit authorization;
Attempted to test, circumvent, or defeat security or auditing systems of the
Village or any organization without prior authorization;
Distributing or storing chain letters, jokes, solicitations, offer to buy or
sell goods, or other non-business material of a trivial or frivolous nature; or
Downloading files or programs not authorized by the Village.
All services and office equipment are provided by the Village for an employee’s
Village business use. Employees should not expect privacy with respect to any
of their activities using the Village provided services and equipment. Without
prior notice or consent, the Village may monitor, retrieve, review, disclose,
or publish anything created, stored, sent, forwarded, retrieved, or received on
any system, including any Internet or World Wide Web sites that an employee
visits using a computer provided by the Village. Very limited or incidental use
of services for personal, non-Village business purposes is acceptable. Personal
use must be infrequent and must not:
Interfere with the productivity of the employee or his or her co-workers;
Consume system resources or storage capacity on an on-going basis; or
Involve large file transfers or otherwise deplete system resources available
for Village purposes.
SECTION 3: TIME OFF/LEAVE OF ABSENCE
3.1   HOLIDAYS
The Village observes the following regular paid holidays per year: New Year’s
Day, Martin Luther King Jr., Presidents Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Fourth
of July, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day and the Friday
after, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
If a recognized holiday falls on a Saturday, the holiday will be observed on
the Friday proceeding. If the holiday falls on a Sunday, the holiday will be
observed on the Monday following. Holidays will not be recognized for both the
Friday and Monday when the Holiday falls on a weekend day.
All full-time employees who do not work on said holiday shall receive pay for
that holiday, at their regular rate of pay based on their normal work day
hours. When a full time employee works on a paid holiday as provided in this
Section, such employee shall be paid the equivalent of one and one-half (1 ½)
hours of straight time pay for the amount of hours worked that day.
If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee’s paid absence (such
as a vacation day or sick day), the absence for the day will be counted as
holiday pay and not against the paid time off.
To be eligible for holiday-pay, a full-time employee who does not have prior
approval for his/her absence from the Mayor or immediate supervisor, must work
the employee’s last scheduled day prior to, and the next scheduled day
subsequent to, the holiday.
3.2   ANNUAL VACATION LEAVE
All full time employees will be eligible for vacation time based upon years of
service. The vacation time will accumulate starting on the date of employment.
Vacation time accrues and shall be capped on a twelve (12) month basis per
employee as follows:
Five (5) paid days of vacation to start accumulating on the date of employment
for the first (1st) year employed.
Ten (10) paid days of vacation for the second full calendar year of employment,
and each calendar year thereafter until the seventh (7th) full calendar year.
Fifteen (15) paid days of vacation for the seventh (7th) full calendar year,
and each calendar year thereafter until the eleventh (11th) full calendar year.
Twenty (20) paid days of vacation for the eleventh (11th) full calendar year,
and each calendar year thereafter.
Vacation time shall commence accrual on the first paycheck following the date
of employment at the rate of 1/52 of the allotted vacation hours per week.
Vacation time shall cease to accrue for those employees who have accrued their
maximum available days of vacation, and shall resume accrual once the employee
uses vacation days which drop the accrued days below the above applicable
twelve (12) month cap on accrual.
Employees must request vacation time from the Chief of Police or Mayor.
Requests should be made with a reasonable amount of advance notice. Where
multiple employees request the same vacation days, employees with seniority
have priority.
All vacation leave will be paid at the regular hourly rate and on the basis of
an eight (8) hour work day. Vacation time may be taken on a daily or weekly
basis.
Any full-time employee who has worked for the Village for at least one year,
and thereafter separates from the Village’s employment for any reason, shall be
entitled upon such separation to receive payment in lieu of vacation earned but
not taken during the calendar year in question.
3.3   SICK LEAVE
All full-time employees are allotted five (5) paid sick days per year, which
will be prorated for the calendar year in which employment begins. Sick days
will accrue up to twenty-five (25) days.
Employees are to notify their immediate supervisor or the Village Clerk’s
office as soon as possible in the event of an absence from work due to illness.
All new full-time employees will begin to earn sick leave after the completion
of six (6) months of full-time employment. Time spent by an employee during a
period when she/he is not on the active payroll due to termination, layoff or
leave of absence shall not constitute service time for the purpose of accruing
sick leave.
To qualify for sick leave benefits, an employee absent due to illness or injury
for three (3) days or more, must present a certification signed by a licensed
physician confirming said illness or injury, to the Mayor, Chief of Police,
Village Clerk or immediate supervisor. The employee will not be paid for sick
leave where there is sufficient evidence of the abuse of said sick leave,
including but not limited to situations where the employee is not ill or
injured. The employee will be subject to disciplinary action pursuant to the
terms of this handbook, where continued abuse of sick leave occurs.
3.4   EMERGENCY LEAVE
In case of serious illness or injury of an emergency nature in the family
(spouse, child, step-child, parent or step-parent), a regular full time
employee may be granted a leave of absence with pay of up to two (2) working
days. Serious illness or injury of an emergency nature refers to an urgent or
life-threatening condition. However, these events do not include the day of a
scheduled operation or out-patient testing involving serious medical
conditions.
3.5   BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
All employees are eligible for three (3) days of paid bereavement leave if a
death occurs within the employee’s immediate family. “Immediate family”
includes spouses, children, and spouse of children, siblings, grandparents,
grandchildren, parents, parents-in-law, and siblings-in-law. The Village may
require proof of attendance at the funeral.
3.6   JURY DUTY
An employee selected for jury duty or called as a witness for a trial or
deposition is eligible to receive full compensation, less the amount the
employee receives from the court as jury pay, for up to five (5) days in any
given calendar year. Subject to any contrary legal requirements, additional
time off for jury beyond the first five days will be unpaid (unless the
employee chooses to apply available accrued paid vacation days or paid personal
days to the absence). Any absence for jury duty, paid or unpaid, will be
considered excused, and during any unpaid period of such leave, the employee
will be treated in the same manner as any other employee on unpaid leave. The
Village may require proof of court attendance, such as a jury summons or a
subpoena.
3.7   MILITARY LEAVE
A leave of absence shall be given to employees with six (6) months of
employment, who are called to active service in the Illinois or United States
Armed Forces. The employee’s employment dates and resulting benefits will
remain intact. The employee shall be entitled to resume their Village
employment in a position of like pay and classification if she/he returns to
Village employment within sixty (60) days of discharge from the Armed Forces.
3.8   LEAVE WITHOUT PAY
Unpaid leaves-of-absence may be granted for purposes set forth in this Section.
Only the Mayor or Chief of Police may grant leaves-of-absence. While on leave-
of-absence, no sick or vacation time or pay will be accumulated. An employee,
who fails to return to work after an approved leave-of-absence, may be
terminated.
3.9   VICTIMS’ ECONOMIC SECURITY AND SAFETY ACT
Pursuant to the Illinois Victims’ Economic Security and Safety Act (VESSA) (810
ILCS 190/1 et seq.), the Village allows an eligible employee who is the victim
of domestic or sexual violence, or who has a family or household member who is
a victim of such violence, to take unpaid leave of up to twelve (12) weeks
during any rolling twelve (12) month period to:
   seek medical attention for , or recover from, physical or psychological
injuries
   obtain services from a victim services organization
   obtain psychological or other counseling
   participate in safety planning, relocation, or other activities to increase
the victim’s safety
   seek legal assistance
An eligible employee may also request reasonable accommodations to address
actual or threatened domestic or sexual violence.
VESSA leave can be taken in a single twelve (12) week period, intermittently,
or on a reduced work schedule. VESSA leave is unpaid, but employees may elect
to use accrued paid leave as part of their VESSA leave. Employees may not take
VESSA leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under the FMLA Policy.
An employee who requires VESSA leave or some other reasonable accommodation is
responsible for bringing the matter to the attention of the Mayor, Village
Clerk, or immediate supervisor.
3.10   TUITION REIMBURSEMENT
The Village Board may approve tuition reimbursement to employees who are
required to obtain certifications of skills for Village operations, with prior
Board approval.
3.11   TRAINING
The Village shall ensure police employees conform to mandatory training
standards established by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards
Board. Continuing professional education and training is encouraged; however,
all police employee training must be approved prior to attendance by the Chief
of Police or Mayor.
3.12   WORKPLACE INJURY
If you become injured on the job, you may be eligible for Workers’ Compensation
benefits. Any injury must be immediately reported to your Supervisor, no matter
how slight and regardless of whether you believe you need medical attention at
the time of injury. Failure to immediately report any work related injury (no
matter how slight) may be subject to disciplinary action or to termination.
Workers Compensation Leave is governed by Illinois law.
3.13   UNPAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE (FMLA)
Eligibility
Any employee who 1) has been employed by the employer for at least twelve (12)
months, 2) worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during
the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the
leave.
Eligible employees are entitled to a total of twelve (12) work weeks of leave
for the following reasons:
Because of the birth of a child of the employee, in order to care for that
child.
Because of the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster
care.
In order to care for the spouse, domestic partner or parent of the employee if
that spouse or parent has a serious health condition, or in order to care of a
son or daughter of the employee if that son or daughter has a serious health
condition and is under the age of eighteen (18) or, if eighteen (18) years or
older, is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability.
Because of the employee’s own serious health condition, that makes the employee
unable to perform the functions of his or her position.
The annual entitlement to twelve (12) work weeks of leave is measured on a
“rolling” basis which looks backward to the twelve (12) month period ending on
the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. That is, each time an employee takes
FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any balance of the twelve
(12) weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding twelve (12)
months.
Hospital Care
Inpatient care (i.e. an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential
medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or subsequent
treatment in connection with such inpatient care.
Absence Plus Treatment
A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days (including
any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same
condition). that also involves:
Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse or
physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by
a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by , a
health care provider; or
Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a
regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care
provider.
Pregnancy
Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care.
Chronic Conditions Requiring Treatments
Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic
serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:
Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse
or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health provider
Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a
single underlying condition); and
May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma,
diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).
Permanent/Long-term Conditions Requiring Supervision
A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for
which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be
under the continuing supervision of, but not be receiving active treatment by,
a health provider. Examples include Alzheimer’s, a stroke, or the terminal
stages of a disease.
Multiple Treatments (Non-Chronic Conditions)
Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of
recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a provider of health care
services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for
restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that
would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3)
consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment,
such as cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.) sever arthritis (physical
therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).
Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flue, ear aches,
upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraine, routine dental or
orthodontia problems, periodontal disease, etc. are example of conditions that
do not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do not qualify for
family and medical leave.
Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this
term are otherwise met. However, family and medical leave may only be taken for
treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of
health care services on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand,
absence because of the employee’s use of the substance, rather than treatment,
does not qualify for family and medical leave.
Intermittent Leave
Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced hours basis when medically
necessary, or to provide care or psychological comfort to an immediate family
member with serious health condition. If an employee requests that his or her
leave be taken on an intermittent or reduced hours basis, the employer may
require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position with
equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates recurring periods of leave
than the employee’s regular position.
Spouse’s Employed by Same Employer
A husband and wife who are both employed by the same employer are entitled to
take only a combined total of twelve (12) weeks of leave during the applicable
twelve (12) month period if the leave is taken pursuant to reasons above, or to
care of the employee’s parent with a serious condition.
Substitution of Paid Leave
Employees are required to use all available accrued paid leave concurrently
with FMLA leave to the extent allowed by the FMLA. Any FMLA leave remaining
after all applicable accrued leave has been exhausted will be without pay.
Employee’s weekly worker’s compensation benefits or benefits pursuant to a
temporary disability benefit plan may not supplement these benefits with
accrued paid leave unless doing so is agreed on by both the employer and the
employee.
Notice
If the necessity for leave is foreseeable, the employee must notify the
employer in advance of his or her intention to take leave, at least thirty (30)
days before the leave is to begin. If the thirty (30) day notice is
impracticable, the employee shall provide as much advance notice as is
practicable. An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA leave must
explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the employer to
determine that the leave qualifies under the FMLA. Failure to provide notice as
required in this paragraph may result in delay of the leave.
Medical Certification
All requests for leave for a reason set forth in paragraphs above must be
supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee
or the health care provider of the employee’s son, daughter, spouse, domestic
partner or parent, as appropriate.
The employer will provide the certification forms for completion by the health
care provider. Use of these forms is required. The employee must provide the
certification within fifteen (15) calendar days after the employer requests
certification, unless it is not practicable under the circumstances to do so
despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. Where an employee fails to
timely provide the required certification, FMLA leave may be delayed or denied.
When the employee provides a certification which is incomplete or insufficient
and the employer provides the employee with notice and opportunity to cure the
deficiency, the employee will have seven (7) calendar days to cure the
deficiency with a resubmitted certification.
The employer may obtain clarification and authentication of certifications, and
may require recertification and fitness for duty certifications as allowed by
federal regulation. Certifications may also be subject to second and third
opinions.
Return to Work
Where practicable under the circumstances, employees will be required to
contact their immediate supervisor every two (2) weeks to report on the
employee’s status and intent to return to work. Where a change in circumstances
modifies the anticipated duration of the FMLA leave, the employee must provide
the employer reasonable notice, within two (2) business days, of the changed
circumstances where foreseeable. An employee who fails to return to work or
contact the employer regarding his or her status following conclusion of FMLA
leave will be considered to have voluntarily quit the employment of the
conclusion of the FMLA leave.
FMLA for Military Families
An eligible employee who is the spouse, domestic partner, son, daughter,
parent, or next of kin of a covered service member who is recovering from a
serious illness or injury which was sustained or aggravated in the line of duty
on active duty is entitle to up to twenty-six (26) weeks of leave in a single
twelve (12) month period.
Active Duty Family Leave (Exigency Leave)
Eligible employees are entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of leave because of
“any qualifying exigency” arising out of the fact that the spouse, domestic
partner, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is a member of any branch of
the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or Reserves, and is on active
duty in a foreign country or has been notified of an impending call to active
duty status in a foreign country. This leave is subject to the same aggregate
twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave per rolling year as the traditional forms of
FMLA leave.
Both types of military family FMLA leave are subject to certification or other
verification requirements.
General Provisions
The employer is the sole administrator of this policy and, as such, is the
exclusive interpreter of its terms. The employer reserves the right to modify
this policy at any time.
All provisions of this policy shall be interpreted consistent with the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended.
For further information regarding employee rights and responsibilities under
the Family and Medical Leave Act see WHD Publication 1420.
3.14   RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM
The Village is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to
qualified individuals with disabilities. This includes providing reasonable
accommodation where appropriate in order for a qualified individual, whether an
applicant for employment or an existing employee, to perform the essential
functions of the job in question.
It is the policy of the Village to provide modified or alternate work when
appropriate for an employee injured on the job, which is unable to temporarily
or permanently return to his/her regular job classification. Regular modified
and alternative work will be provided as available and appropriate in full
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
It is your responsibility to notify the Village if you need an accommodation.
We ask that you make any and all such requests to the Village President and in
writing. After receiving your request, the Village will engage in an
interactive dialogue with you to determine the precise limitation of your
disability on your ability to perform the essential job duties of your position
and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those
limitations.
The Village encourages you to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that
you believe would allow you to perform your job. However, the Village is not
required to make the specific accommodation requested by you and may provide an
alternative, effective accommodation, to the extent any reasonable
accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on the Village.

ARTICLE IV – SERVICE CHARGES
31-4-1 BASIS FOR FEES.
   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the Village shall consist of a minimum monthly charge
and a basic user rate.
   The Wastewater Service Charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations:
   (A)   A five (5) day, 20 degree Centigrade (20°C) bi-chemical oxygen demand
(BOD) of 200 mg/l.
   (B)   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and
shall be computed as follows:
   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the
wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year for all works
categories.
   (A)   Estimate wastewater volume to be treated.
   (B)   Compute costs per 1000 gallons for normal sewage strength.
   A surcharge will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal
concentration for BOD (200 mg/1) and SS (250 mg/1). The surcharge will be based
on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes
which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/1 concentration for BOD and SS
respectively. Section
31-4-6 and
31-4-7 specify the procedure to compute surcharge.
   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by
certified public accountants for the Village in their annual audit report. The
wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in
operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
31-4-2 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges shall be the
metered water consumption read to the lowest even 100 increment of 1000
gallons.
31-4-3 MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE.
    There shall be and there is hereby established a minimum charge for the use
of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Village. A
minimum basic charge of Fifteen Dollars and Seventy Five Cents ($15.75) per
month shall be applied to all users whose water consumption does not exceed two
thousand (2,000) gallons per month.
(Ord. No. 24-009; 5-14-24)
31-4-4 SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE RATE.
   There shall be and there is hereby established an additional charge
supplementing the basic minimum rate for the use of and for the service
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Village. An additional rate of
Five Dollars and Thirty-Three Cents ($5.33) per one thousand (1,000) gallons
shall be applied to all users for water consumption in excess of two thousand
(2,000) gallons per month.
   This supplemental service rate shall be computed by the following formula:
   C=$15.75 + ($5.33 (V-2000)/1000)
   Where C= wastewater service charge on a monthly billing basis.
   V= volume (in gallons) of metered water consumption during the billing
period.
   If "V" is equal to or less than two thousand (2,000) gallons, the minimum
monthly charge will not go into effect for that billing cycle.
(Ord. No. 24-009; 5-14-24)
31-4-5 NON-METERED SEWER RATES.
   The rate for non-metered sewer users will be based on the number of
occupants of the residence if it is a residential establishment. The rates
shall be as follows:
   OCCUPANTS   MONTHLY SEWER RATE
   1            $5.00
   2            $5.00
   3            $6.80
   4            $8.80
   5            $10.80
   Occupancy above two (2) will be assessed One Dollar Eighty Cents ($1.80) per
month.
   If the Sanitary and Health Committee determines that a significant amount of
sewage above the estimated amount is being discharged, the monthly charge will
be adjusted accordingly.
31-4-6 SURCHARGE RATE.
   The rates of surcharges for BOD 5 and SS shall be as follows:
   C   =   $13.50 + ($5.00 (VS2000)/I000)
   CS   =   Wastewater (surcharge) service charge on a monthly basis
   V   =   Volume (in gallons) of metered water consumption during the billing
period. If V is equal to or less than two thousand (2,000) gallons, the minimum
charge will be Thirteen Dollars Fifty Cents ($13.50)
31-4-7 COMPUTATION OF SURCHARGE.  
   The concentration of wastes used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as
may be deemed necessary by the Committee and shall be dining as a basis for
surcharges.
31-4-8 LEAKAGE.
   Because water from leaks are not actually passing through sewer treatment, a
credit may be authorized to a customer's sewer charge calculated using the
rates herein and equivalent to that amount of water usage determined to be
attributable to a water service line leak. The determination shall be made by
the Committee, subject to review by the Board of Trustees. The average past
water usage of the customer will be one factor considered in determining the
amount attributable to leaks.
31-4-9 REVENUES.
   All revenues and monies derived from the operation of the sewerage system
shall be deposited in the sewage account of the sewerage fund. All such
revenues and monies shall be held by the Village Treasurer separate and apart
from his private funds and separate and apart from all other funds of the
Village and all of said sum, without any deductions whatever, shall be
delivered to the Village Treasurer not more than ten (10) days after receipt of
the same, or at such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be
directed by the President and Board of Trustees.

system and all other funds and monies incident to the operations of such system
as the same may be delivered to and deposit the same in the account of the fund
designated as the “Sewerage Fund of the Village of Hamel”. The Treasurer shall
administer such fund in every respect in the manner provided by statute of the
Illinois Municipal Code, as amended.
31-4-10 DELINQUENCY.
   In the event that charges for sewerage service are not paid within thirty
(30) days after rendition of the bill for such service such charges shall be
deemed and are herby declared to be delinquent and thereafter such delinquency
shall constitute a lien upon the real estate for which such service is
supplied, and the Village Clerk be and s/he is hereby authorized and directed
to file sworn statements showing such delinquencies in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Madison County, and the filing of such statement shall be
deemed notice of the lien of such charges for such service.
   That all sewerage service shall be discontinued without further notice if
the rates or charges for such services are not paid within thirty (30) days
after rendition of the bill therefore.
31-4-11 COLLECTION.

shall be made of all transactions relative to the sewerage system, and at
regular annual intervals he shall cause to be made an audit by an independent
auditing concern of the books to show the receipts and disbursements of the
sewerage system.
   In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report
shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the wastewater
facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer service
charges under the waste cost recovery system do, in fact, meet these
regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the audit
report shall include the following:
   (A)   Flow date showing total gallons received at the wastewater plant for
the current fiscal year.
   (B)   Billing date to show total number of gallons billed.
   (C)   Number of users connected to the system.
   (D)   Number of non-metered users.

ARTICLE VIII – CONFINED ENTRY POLICY
31-8-1 ADOPTED BY REFERENCE.
   The provisions of Exhibit “A” shall be the official policy concerning the
“Confined Space Entry Policy”. (Ord. No. 14-014; 11-12-14)
SEWAGE SYSTEM
EXHIBIT “A”
CONFINED SPACE ENTRY POLICY
   Confined Space Entry is a dangerous task that must be performed from time to
time by the Public Works Department. This written policy is designed to
identify these confined spaces and outline the procedures to be used when
necessary to enter these spaces.
Confined Space Identification. A Confined Space is an environment which has
limited openings for entry and exit, unfavorable natural ventilation, is not
intended for continuous human occupancy and could reasonably be believed to
have dangerous air contaminants.
The Confined Spaces within the Village of Hamel include the following:
   (A)   All Sanitary Sewer Manholes currently maintained by the Public Works
Department.
   (B)   All Sanitary Sewer Lift Stations currently maintained by the Public
Works Department.
   (C)   All Storm Sewer Structures currently maintained by the Public Works
Department.
Safety and Health Procedures. NO Village employee may enter a Confined Space
unless they have received training on the entry procedures established in this
policy. Annual training will be required for all employees in the Public Works
Department. This training may include assistance from representatives from the
Illinois Department of Labor.
Entry Procedures are as Follows:
   (A)   Evaluate the Area. Block off the entrance to non-authorized personnel.
Based on the size and shape of the space, the type of work to be done, the
nature and contaminants which are present or may be introduced as a result of
the work, and the number of employees who must enter the Confined Space,
determine which additional entry precautions may be needed.
   There must always be sufficient manpower available to perform the work
without creating a hazardous situation.
   (B)   Provide Forced Ventilation. When it has been determined that a
Confined Space must be entered for any reason, and occupied by a Village
employee, the atmosphere within the Confined Space shall be continuously
provided with forced ventilation. The ventilation equipment shall be set up and
placed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
   (C)   Test the Atmosphere. Using the atmospheric testing device provided by
the Village, test the atmosphere of the Confined Space from top to bottom prior
to entry. The employees shall use the device according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The device shall be field-tested and maintained for accuracy.
Testing will be in three (3) foot intervals. Hazards may be at different levels
of the space.
   A Confined Space SHALL NOT be entered until the atmosphere has been tested
and found to have the following characteristics:
   An Oxygen content of at least 19.5%, but not greater than 23.5% by volume.
   A Hydrogen Sulfide Level of less than 10 parts per million.
   A Combustible Gas/Vapor Mixture of less than 10% of the lower explosive
limit.
   A Concentration of any Hazardous Chemical less than the limits listed in 29
CFR 1910 subpart Z.
   Carbon Monoxide of not more than 35 parts per million.
   (D)   Space Entry. An attendant will be assigned to monitor activity inside
and outside the space. At NO time should the attendant enter the space. The
attendant will provide air monitoring at all times. The attendant shall be
trained in CPR and first-aid.
   With continuous forced ventilation properly in place and in operation, and
after the atmosphere testing indicates a safe work environment, the employee
may enter the space to perform the necessary work. The employee shall be
equipped with a continuous atmospheric monitoring device at all times.
   Should the monitoring device signal that the air quality has exceeded the
regulatory safety limits, or upon attendant order, ALL EMPLOYEES shall
IMMEDIATELY exit the Confined Space.
   Re-entry may occur, if the contamination source is discontinued, and when
the atmospheric testing device indicates an atmosphere within the regulatory
safety limits.
   If any Confined Space cannot be brought within the regulatory safety limits,
the remaining maintenance or work required within the Confined Space area shall
be performed by an experienced contractor properly equipped to work under
hazardous conditions.
   (E)   Additional Entry Requirements. Additional precautions will be taken in
certain circumstances, to eliminate the danger of a fall injury (a depth
greater than five (5) feet) or a distance which would take more than 2 or 3
seconds to travel 15 to 20 feet, should the monitoring device signal a
hazardous environment condition. During these cases, all Village Employees
entering such Confined Spaces, shall be wearing D-Ring body harness provided by
the Village, with a safety rope attached to the ring.
   All manholes greater than a depth of five (5) feet will require the entry
assistance of a TRI-POD entry system equipped with a FALL/BREAK system.
   In the case of working in an open area, a safety rope of sufficient length
shall be connected from the workers harness ring to the top-side employee.
   THE TOP-SIDE EMPLOYEE SHALL REMAIN WITHIN EYE CONTACT WITH THE CONFINED
SPACE WORKER AT ALL TIMES AND NOT BE ASSIGNED ANY OTHER DUTY.
Equipment Operation and Maintenance.
   The following equipment shall be obtained and maintained by the Village of
Hamel for Confined Space Entry and shall be used by all employees after proper
training:
D-RING BODY HARNESS and ROPE
TRI-POD FALL PROTECTION SYSTEM
ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING DEVICE - 4 GASES
VENTILATION EQUIPMENT
MSA BREATHING EQUIPMENT
ALL EQUIPMENT SHALL BE OPERATED AND MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER’S
SPECIFICATIONS.
Air monitors shall be field zero tested before each use and receive bump test
of known gases monthly.
Emergency Procedures.
   When a Confined Space worker is alerted to a potential hazardous condition,
he or she shall IMMEDIATELY EXIT THE CONFINED SPACE.
The space may not be re-entered until the contamination source has been
discontinued or when the atmospheric testing device indicates an atmosphere
within the regulatory safety limits.
IF A WORKER WITHIN A CONFINED SPACE SHOULD COLLAPSE AND BECOME UNCONSCIOUS, THE
TOP-SIDE EMPLOYEE SHALL MAKE EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT TO COMPLETE THE RESCUE, BUT
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE IS THE TOP-SIDE EMPLOYEE TO ENTER THE CONFINED SPACE TO
ATTEMPT A RESCUE.
THE TOP-SIDE EMPLOYEE SHALL IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE VILLAGE OF HAMEL FIRE AND
POLICE DEPARTMENTS, ALERTING THEM OF THE EXISTING CONDITION AND PROVIDE
WHATEVER ASSISTANCE HE OR SHE CAN.
Training.
   This policy shall be reviewed each year as part of an annual Confined Spaces
Entry Training Program. A representative from the Illinois Department of Labor
may be requested to provide employees additional or updated materials which may
or may not require this policy to be amended.
Retaining will be provided if observation indicates a lack of knowledge. All
employees will be CPR and first-aid trained.
Self Rescue.
Entrant recognizes a hazard and exits the space.
Attendant order the entrant to exit space.
Non-Entry Rescue.
   Entrant wears a full body harness attached to tripod before entry. The
attendant can remove the entrant without entering the space. This equipment
will also provide fall protection.
Rescue by Others.
   This is the most difficult because rescue in an oxygen deficient atmosphere
should be within four to six minutes.
Contractor.
   All work performed by contractors must be coordinated by the Village of
Hamel.

For example, if you desire inspection on Tuesday, contact us on Monday. If you
desire inspection on Monday, contact us on Friday, etc.
3.   If the sewer line is deep enough to drain your basement, if you have one,
then the wastes from the basement as well as the other floor(s) of the property

integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village rights-of-way and
the Village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent.
   In enacting this Article, the Village intends to exercise its authority over
the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of the public ways

parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities Subject to this Article.
   This Article applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A
facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Article may
continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
   The Village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities
to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of
locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within the Village rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to
enter into such an agreement may request that the Village enter into such an
agreement. In such an agreement, the Village may provide for terms and
conditions inconsistent with this Article.
   (E)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.   
      (1)   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers.
   In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications Providers.
   In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions
of this Article and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar
agreement between the Village and any telecommunications provider, the
provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and
control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension
thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Articles or Chapters.
   This Article supersedes all Articles or Chapters or parts of Articles or
Chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of
such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State and Federal Laws.
   In the event that applicable federal or State laws or regulations conflict
with the requirements of this Article, the utility shall comply with the
requirements of this Article to the maximum extent possible without violating
federal or State laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment.
   The Village shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this
Article and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in
this Article when the Village so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed
to limit the ability of the Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

33-4-5 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village Review of Permit Applications.
   Completed permit applications, containing all required documentation, shall
be examined by the Superintendent within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent shall reject such
application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Superintendent is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Article
and all applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the
Superintendent shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this Article.
   (B)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this Article for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent shall specify the
portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used or
constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Superintendent fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
(b) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this Article.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section
33-4-4 of this Article the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (A) of this
Section.
   (C)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007.
   Applications by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization
under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted
forty-five (45) days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted
upon by the Village, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
33-4-6 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Article on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration.
   No permit issued under this Article shall be valid for a period longer than
six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-Construction Meeting Required.
   No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Article
prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and
subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction
meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place
designated by the Village with such Village representatives in attendance as
the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing
the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in
the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or
absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures
to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public
during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance With All Laws Required.
   The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse the permittee from
complying with other requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations.
33-4-7 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with Section
33-4-21 of this Article. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
33-4-8 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required Coverages and Limits.
   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each
utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way
shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring
the utility as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and
appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on
the policies listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred as
“X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (b)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies.
   The coverages required by this Section may be in any combination of primary,
excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide
excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that
when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the
primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such
loss.
   (C)   Copies Required.
   The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this
Section to the Village within ten (10) days following receipt of a written
request therefor from the Village.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages.
   The insurance policies required by this Section shall contain the following
endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew.”
   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by paragraph (A) of this
Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under paragraph (A), or the requirements of paragraphs (B), (C) and
(D) of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under paragraph (A) of
this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer”
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s Liability.
   The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of
the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies.
   All insurance provided pursuant to this Section shall be effected under
valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct
business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and
surplus line carriers shall be rates “A-“ or better and of a class size “X” or
higher by A.M. Best Company.
33-4-9 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Article by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
33-4-10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose.
   The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in an amount as
set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be continuously maintained
in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole cost and expense until
the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The Security Fund shall
serve a security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Article or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form.
   The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at
the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the
Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
paragraph shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount.
   The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for
the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a
condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as
determined by the Superintendent, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction
under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this paragraph (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals.
   The Village, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written notice clearly stating
the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
paragraph, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen
(14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment.
   Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the Village
that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall
restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in paragraph (C) of this
Section.
   (F)   Interest.
   The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in
the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written
request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal
does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required in
paragraph (C) of this Section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund.
   Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall
be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as
remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all
offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to
comply with any provisions of this Article or other applicable law. In the
event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all
accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the
extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the
Village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of
said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited.
   The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the Security Fund are in
addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this Article
or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right
with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the Village may
have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a
double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be
infringed or otherwise violated.
33-4-11 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Village Right to Revoke Permit.
   The Village may revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Article
for one or more of the following reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete

      (3)   Permittee’s physical presence or presence of permittee’s facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;

deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,

revocation.
The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this paragraph.
   (D)   Stop Work Order.
   In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation or suspension, the
Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery of any of the
reasons for revocation set forth within paragraph (A) of this Section.
   (E)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply.
   If the permittee fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (C) of
this Section, the Village or its designee may, at the option of the Village:
      (1)   correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to the permittee, remove
the subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   after not less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of
failure to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the
Village. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all
costs of removal.
33-4-12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less
than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this Article, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village’s right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and Bonding.
   All required insurance coverage or bonding must be changed to reflect the
name of the new owner upon transfer.
33-4-13 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards and Principles.
   All construction in the right-of-way shall be consistent with applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, and commonly recognized and
accepted traffic control and construction principles, sound engineering
judgment and, where applicable, the principles and standards set forth in the

way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner satisfactory to the
Village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures.
   Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a
permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flags. If a hazard does not
exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Superintendent or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
Village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency Repairs.
   The utility must file in writing with the Village a description of the
repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within forty-eight (48) hours after an
emergency repair.
33-4-21 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Request for Variance. A utility requesting a variance from one or more
of the provisions of this Article must do so in writing to the Superintendent
as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision
of this Article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a
variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to Grant Variances.
   The Superintendent shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each
provision of this Article identified in the variance request on an individual
basis.
   (C)   Conditions for Granting of Variance.
   The Superintendent may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting
the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance.
   As a condition for authorizing a variance, the Superintendent may require
the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this Article but which carry
out the purposes of this Article.
   (E)   Right to Appeal.
   Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination,
including denial of a variance, made by the Superintendent under the provisions
of this Article shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such
other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall
be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the
date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Village Board
shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly
scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the
appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the appeal.
33-4-22 PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
Article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (See Section
1-1-20 for additional penalties.)
33-4-23 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Article.

buildings throughout the Village;
   (F)   to preserve the Village’s natural beauty and topography to the maximum
feasible extent;
   (G)   to protect against injury or damage caused by pollution, storm water
runoff, erosion and sedimentation, or similar hazards;

   (A)   This Code shall be applicable within the corporate limits of the
Village and within all unincorporated territory located within one and one-half
(1 ½) miles of said limits, provided such territory is not located within the
subdivision jurisdiction of another municipality. Jurisdictional boundary lines
shall be determined in accordance with 65 ILCS 5/11-12-9.
   (B)   Whenever the requirements of this Code differ from those of any
easement, statute, other lawfully adopted ordinance or regulation, the more
stringent requirement shall prevail. Developers are therefore encouraged to
review such regulations, including requirements of the Illinois Department of
Transportation, and to ensure compliance. In accordance with State law,
whenever this Code imposes higher standards than any County Subdivision Code,
said higher standards shall supersede any County regulations in unincorporated
territory located within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village.
34-1-4 INTERPRETATION.

in order to be clarified, the Code Administrator identified in Section
34-4-4 shall be vested with the authority to make said interpretation.
   (B)   Any appeal of said interpretation shall be made in writing to the
Planning Commission, which shall review the appeal request and forward a
recommendation to the Village Board of Trustees, whose decision shall be final.
   Any such interpretation, whether by the Code Administrator or the Village
Board of Trustees, shall be reduced to writing and thereafter equitably applied
to all.
   (C)   Every provision of this Code shall be construed liberally in favor of
the Village, and every regulation set forth herein shall be considered the
minimum requirement for the promotion of the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (D)   This Code and the aforementioned statutes shall be construed together
in such a manner as to give full effect to both the regulations and statutes

ARTICLE III - DESIGN AND IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
34-3-1 GENERAL PROHIBITION.
   Streets, sanitary sewer systems, and water treatment and distribution
represent major investments in a community. Obviously these improvements should
be constructed in such a manner so that they become enduring assets to the
community. In order to assure that improvements constructed by a subdivision
developer for dedication to the public are worthy of acceptance by the Village,
this Article sets forth the appropriate design and construction standards
necessary to achieve that goal. The design and improvement standards set forth
herein shall be deemed the minimum requirements for public health, safety, and
general welfare. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as
preventing the Subdivider from constructing improvements that exceed these
requirements.
   (A)   No land within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village; other than
land that is specifically exempted from the requirements of the Illinois Plats
Act (765 ILCS 205/1(b)) shall be subdivided or developed except in compliance
with the regulations of this Article and the applicable provisions of State
law. (See 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8; 765 ILCS 205/1 et seq.)
   (B)   No lot in any subdivision shall be conveyed until:
      (1)   The Final Plat of said subdivision has been approved by the Village
Board and recorded with the County Recorder of Deeds; and
      (2)   The portion of said subdivision of which the lot is located has
been improved in accordance with the requirements of this Article or until an
irrevocable Letter of Credit or some other acceptable assurance has been posted
to warrant the completion of such improvements.
   (C)   No building permit shall be issued to allow construction on any lot
conveyed in violation of this Section, and any so issued shall be made invalid
by said violation.
34-3-2 GENERAL SUITABILITY FOR SUBDIVISION.
   Land which the Village Board determines to be unsuitable for development due
to probable flooding, poor drainage, rough topography, adverse soil conditions,
or other conditions that in the opinion of the Administrator and/or Village
Engineer will prove detrimental to the health, safety and/or general welfare of
the future inhabitants of said tract and/or surrounding areas shall not be
subdivided or developed unless the developer submits plans and methods that the
Administrator or Village Engineer deems adequate to resolve or avoid the
problems caused by the adverse land conditions.
34-3-3 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   It is the intent of this Code and the Village to facilitate the design of
new subdivisions and developments that are in compliance with the provisions
and procedures outlined herein. As such, the Village has developed the
following Standard Specification Plan Sheets in order to illustrate specific
design requirements:
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T1
   Typical Street Cross Sections, Design Considerations and Erosion Control
Methods
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T2
   Typical Street Construction Details
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T3
   Typical Storm Sewer Construction Details
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T4
   Typical Storm Sewer Construction Details
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T5
   Typical Sanitary Sewer Construction Details
Standard Specification Plan Sheet: T6
   Typical Water System Construction Details
   Said Plan Sheets are included herein and made a part hereof by reference.
The Village shall make said Plan Sheets available to all Subdividers/
Developers, who are thereafter encouraged to photocopy said sheets and include
them within the construction plans for the proposed development. By doing so,
the Subdivider/Developer can more easily make the requirements of this Code
known to the contractors responsible for the construction and installation of
improvements within the development, and be more assured that actual
construction will be in compliance with said illustrations.
34-3-4 STANDARDS FOR LOTS.
   The planning and development of lots shall be done in such a manner so as to
assure compliance with the Zoning Code. In order to help achieve this result,
every Subdivider shall comply with the requirements herein.
   (A)   All lots in any subdivision within the Village shall conform to the
minimum lot area and dimension requirements of the Zoning District in which
said subdivision is located.
   (B)   All lots in any subdivision outside the Village, shall conform to the
minimum lot area and dimension requirements of the Village’s Zoning District
which is most appropriate; as determined by the Administrator of this Code.
   (C)   Land contained with lakefront lots that is under water when the lake
is at its highest level, or land reserved for street improvements shall not be
counted in determining compliance with minimum lot size requirements.
   (D)   If possible, the creation of through lots should be avoided in all new
subdivisions.
   (E)   Every corner and through lot shall be large enough to permit
compliance with the Zoning District’s front setback requirement on every side
of said lot that faces a street.
   (F)   All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to avoid the creation
of non-buildable or nonconforming parcels.
   (G)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street right-
of-way lines or radial to curved street right-of-way lines, except where the
Village Engineer has determined that a deviation from this requirement will
provide a street and lot design more beneficial to the Village.
   (H)   All side lot lines of lots which front a cul-de-sac shall be at right
angles to the centerline of said cul-de-sac until the point at which the
centerline meets the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround. Side lot lines beyond
that point shall be radial to the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround except
where the Village Engineer has determined that a deviation from this
requirement will provide a street and lot design more beneficial to the
Village.
   (I)   Flag Lots.
   The use of flag lots is normally prohibited everywhere in this Municipality.
There may be certain circumstances and instances where the use of flag lots is
required due to physical limitations or other factors out of the control of the
developer including wasted or damaging building areas in areas of environmental
sensitivity. Flag lot usage within a subdivision development may be permitted
by requesting a variance to the subdivision control ordinance, following the
procedures and requirements as listed herein.
      (1)   Variation Procedure and Criteria.
   The Plan Commission shall first determine the following criteria before any
flag lots shall be permitted as an approved lot subdivision method.
         (a)   Property Values.
   Flag lots shall not significantly reduce property values in the neighborhood
areas adjoining and within the proposed development. The Plan Commission among
other things, shall consider the size of nearby lots in comparison to the
proposed flag lots when considering whether property values have been reduced;
and
         (b)   Physical or Geographical Restraints.
            (i)   The physical terrain, or the configuration of the land to be
subdivided and the location of non-accessible streets or any combination of the
above, is such that subdivision of said area into standard lots in accordance
with regular subdivision standards are not feasible.
            (ii)   Conventional division would result in greater erosion
hazard, loss of trees, or other environmental damage which could be prevented
by use of a flag lot.
The subdivider or their assignee must make application for a variation to
permit flag lots within their development on the subdivision application and
forms as provided for in the department of development administration.
      (2)   Use of Flag Lots.
         If flag lots are requested and approved as a variation to the
subdivision control ordinance, the following criteria will be utilized as
minimal design standards to permit flag lots within a subdivision development.
      (3)   Standards and Use.
         Minimum standards for usage of flag lots:
         (a)   Minimum lot size is seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square
feet, exclusive of the area of the “flagpole” or “panhandle” with a width at
the established building line of not less than seventy-five (75) feet and not
less than one hundred (100) feet in average depth.
         (b)   The minimum panhandle width shall be thirty (30) feet and shall
only serve the lot to which is connected.
         (c)   Minimum access paving width of the driveway used for access
shall be twelve (12) feet.
         (d)   Driveways and parking areas shall be constructed of at least six
(6) inches thick P.C. concrete driveway pavement, or equal, as approved by the
Director of Public Works. Driveway portions of a flag lot must be constructed
prior to final plat approval of the subdivision, unless at the developer’s
election, money is escrowed for construction of the driveway. No occupancy
permit shall be issued without construction of the driveway to stated
standards.
         (e)   Sub-base and base course of driveways and parking areas shall be
inspected and be acceptable to the Director of Public Works prior to final
surfacing.
         (f)   Whether or not the panhandle is used for access, it shall remain
free of structures and be available for possible future access to a public
street.
         (g)   Each rear lot or parcel shall have two (2) unenclosed parking
spaces plus at least two (2) enclosed with sufficient turn around area to
eliminate the necessity for a vehicle to back out onto the street. The parking
spaces shall not be located in the panhandle portion of the driveways.
         (h)   The lot size, yard areas, dwelling standards, and conditions of
use shall be the same for flag lots as for any other lot in a particular zoning
district.
         (i)   If public utility easements are located on the flagpole or
panhandle portion of the lot, then the pole portion of the lot shall be a
minimum of thirty-five (35) feet in width.
         (j)   The flagpole or panhandle sidelines shall be parallel.
         (k)   The length of the panhandle or flagpole shall not exceed two
hundred (200) feet in length.
         (l)   An area for garbage pick-up shall be identified and designated
which is alongside the street onto which the private drive leads.
         (m)   The mailbox for all flag lots shall be located at the corner of
the driveway and the street. House numbers must be located on the mailbox. No
occupancy permit will be issued without meeting these requirements.
         (n)   Commercial or manufacturing flag lots are allowed on the same
variance basis as above. No access is allowed through residential areas,
residentially zoned areas, or residential local streets. Yards of commercial/
manufacturing flag lot adjacent to residential zones must take the buffer
distance required when non-residential and residential zones abut.
(Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
34-3-5 STREET FRONTAGE REQUIRED.
   All land to be subdivided, shall be divided in such a way that each lot
abuts a public street meeting the requirements of Sections
34-3-6 and 34-3-16. (Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
34-3-6 REFERENCE MONUMENTS REQUIRED.
   In accordance with “An Act to Revise the Law in Relation to Plats”, 765 ILCS
205/1(a) et seq., as amended from time to time, reference monuments shall be
erected by each Subdivider as follows:
   (A)   In the Field.
   Stone or reinforced concrete reference monuments, set in the ground in such
a manner that they will not be moved by frost, shall be placed in the field, at
opposite corners of the subdivision.
   (B)   At Lot Corners.
   Every lot corner shall be marked by an iron pin or pipe, at least one-half
(1/2) inch in diameter and not less than twenty-four (24) inches long, driven
into the ground deep enough that they do not protrude above the surface more
than one and one-half (1 ½) inches.
      (1)   No lot in any subdivision shall be sold unless the corners of said
lot are marked as specified above at the time of sale.
   (C)   Front Lot Corners.
   Front lot corners abutting platted street shall be marked in the curb by a
saw cut “T” (minimum of one-quarter (1/4) inch deep and maximum of one-half (1/
2) inch deep) in addition to the lot pins required above.
34-3-7 CLEARING AND GRUBBING.
   (A)   Prior to grading within the limits of the right-of-way, the entire
area to be affected with improvements, including areas intended for pavement,
water mains, sewer lines, and drainage facilities, shall be cleared of all tree
stumps, roots, brush, and other objectionable materials and of all trees not
intended for preservation.
(Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
34-3-8 EROSION CONTROL.
   Because of the possibility that excessive quantities of soil will erode from
areas undergoing subdivision or development and the construction of related
improvements, this Code requires the use of specific erosion control measures.
Sediment from soil erosion can reduce the channel capacity of waterways,
thereby limiting their use for many beneficial purposes and resulting in
increased chances of flooding, a risk to public health and safety. Sediment can
also clog sewers and ditches; pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, and
reservoirs; and necessitate costly repairs to gullies, washed out fill and
embankments.
   In order to help safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the
environment, and promote the public welfare, the provisions of this Section
guide, regulate and control the design, construction, use, maintenance of any
development which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the
movement of earth on land situated within the Village.
   In addition to other penalties authorized, any person, partnership, or
corporation convicted of violating any of the provisions of the erosion control
provisions of this Code shall be required to restore the affected site to the
condition existing prior to commission of the violation, or to reimburse the
Village for the expense of such restoration.
34-3-9 GENERAL EROSION CONTROL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Whenever feasible, natural contours should be followed as closely as
possible in areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills might otherwise be
required, so that the design of every subdivision is consistent with the
natural limitations presented by topography and soil, and so as to create the
least potential for soil erosion.
   (B)   Wherever possible, natural vegetation should be retained and protected
and areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left
undisturbed.
   (C)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (D)   During development, the Subdivider/Developer shall install temporary
erosion control measures to prevent siltation of adjacent streams, roads, and
property.
   (E)   The Subdivider/Developer shall install and maintain appropriate
permanent devices, such as sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins,
silt traps, filters, rip rap, or energy dissipaters, in order to prevent long
term erosion and siltation and to remove sediment from runoff waters.
   (F)   The Subdivider/Developer shall select erosion and sedimentation
control measures based upon an assessment of the probable frequency of climatic
and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and upon an evaluation of the
risks, costs, and benefits involved.
   (G)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (H)   Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
of discharges will not create additional erosion.
   (I)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development, and in no case exceed more than ninety (90) days.
34-3-10 EROSION CONTROL PLAN.
   (A)   No Subdivider/Developer shall commence or perform any grading,
stripping, or excavating of land, without having first submitted an Erosion
Control Plan as part of the Improvement Plan process outlined in Section
34-4-20, and received approval therefor.
      (1)   The developer shall not be relieved of responsibility for damage to
persons or property otherwise imposed by law and the Village or its officers or
agents are not made liable for such damage, by:
         (a)   the approval of a plan under this Code;
         (b)   compliance with the provisions of that plan or with conditions
attached to it by the Building and Zoning Administrator or any representative
or agent to the Village;
         (c)   failure of Village Officials to observe or recognize hazardous
or unsightly conditions;
         (d)   failure of Village Officials to recommend denial of, or to deny
a plan; or
         (e)   exemptions from the plan requirements of this Code.
      (2)   Plans, specifications, and reports for all site developments shall
be retained with the Subdivision Improvements Plans.
   (B)   The Erosion Control Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the
standards and requirements contained in “Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois”, prepared by the
Northeastern Illinois Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Steering
Committee, and recognized by the Madison County Soil and Water Conservation
District.
   (C)   No Erosion Control Plan shall be approved for any intended development
site unless:
      (1)   Where applicable, the proposed subdivision, planned unit
development, or other development has been approved by the Village, or
      (2)   The proposed site is situated within, and the earthwork is being
performed, as part of a Comprehensive Development Plan previously approved by
the Village.
   (D)   Any significant amendments of the approved Erosion Control Plan shall
be submitted to the Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated
representative, reviewed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the
original plan.
      (1)   Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the
Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated representative by written
authorization to the Subdivider/Developer.
   (E)   Every Erosion Control Plan shall expire and become null and void if
the work authorized by such plan has not been commenced within one hundred
eighty (180) days, or is not completed by a date which shall be specified in
the plan.
      (1)   The Building and Zoning Administrator may grant a reasonable
extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of
the plan, and if the developer presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the
specified time limits.
   (F)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or his designated representative
may authorize exceptions to any of the erosion control requirements and
regulations set forth in this Code, in accordance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   An application for any requested exception shall be made by written
petition of the Subdivider/Developer and filed with all other documents
required as part of the erosion control plan.
      (2)   Said petition shall clearly state the grounds upon which it is
based and the facts relied upon by the Subdivider/Developer.
      (3)   In order for said petition to be granted, the Building and Zoning
Administrator shall determine all of the following:
         (a)   That the land referred to in the petition is of such shape or
size, or is affected by such physical conditions, or is subject to such title
limitations of record, that it is impossible or impracticable for the applicant
to comply with all of the requirements of these provisions;
         (b)   That the exception is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         (c)   That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the
subject property.
   (G)   If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in
phases, the Subdivider/Developer shall give notice and request the inspections
required in Section
34-4-22 for each separate phase at each of the stages of work listed in said
Section.
      (1)   If the Village determines by inspection at any stage of the earth
work that further work, although authorized by an erosion control plan, is
likely to imperil property, public ways, watercourses or drainage structures,
the Village may require that special precautions be taken in order to minimize
the likelihood of such peril, and may require said precautions as a condition
of allowing the work to continue.
         (a)   “Special precautions” may include, but shall not be limited to:
a more level exposed slope; construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing; installation of plant materials for
erosion control; or recommendations from a registered soils engineer and/or
engineering geologist.
      (2)   Should it appear that damage may result from pending storms because
the grading on any development site is not complete, the Village may require
that work be stopped and that the Subdivider/Developer install temporary
structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining
property or the public safety.
      (3)   On large developments or where unusual, site conditions prevail,
the Village may specify an allowable time period during which earthwork may be
performed, or may require that earthwork be conducted in specific stages so as
to insure completion of protection measures or devices prior to the advent of
seasonal rains.
   (H)   The Village may waive specific requirements for the content of said
plan upon determining the information as submitted is sufficient to show that
work will comply with the objectives and principles of this Code.
34-3-11 STANDARDS FOR GRADING.
   (A)   All grading necessitated for the construction of pavement, curb and
gutter, sidewalks, right-of-way and drainage facilities shall be done in such a
manner so as to assure a uniform subgrade with adequate bearing capacity to
properly support the loading/structures to be superimposed.
   (B)   All topsoil shall be removed from areas proposed for the construction
of pavement, curb and gutter, or sidewalks, and under no circumstances shall
said improvements be constructed on topsoil, or on any other soil not capable
of meeting the specifications for compaction specified herein.
   (C)   The developer/subdivider shall show proposed final grades, at all rear
lot corners, on the construction/improvement plans for all lots. The developer/
subdivider shall place concrete markers at intervals not to exceed 100 feet or
points on line along the flowline where a surface drainage swale is to be
constructed with the top of the markers set at the design grade as shown on the
plan drawings. Concrete monuments shall be a minimum size of four inches square
and 30 inches long.
(Ord. No. 23- 005; 3-13-23)
34-3-12 SUBGRADES.
   (A)   All subgrades shall be properly graded to the lines and grades shown
on the plans for the given project.
   (B)   In areas to be cut below existing grade, the Contractor responsible
for rough grading shall take the following steps in an effort to obtain less
than ninety-five percent (95%) of the standard laboratory density in the
subgrade.
      (1)   The subgrade shall be cleared of all unsuitable material,
including, but not limited to, vegetation, tree stumps and roots, trash,
debris, soft spongy soil, etc., for a minimum depth of eighteen (18) inches
below subgrade elevation.
      (2)   Plan ditches that drain the area are to be cut to grade at least
two (2) weeks prior to the work required in the following paragraph.
      (3)   The top eight (8) inches of subgrade shall be air dried, and shall
include processing the soil utilizing discs or tillers to a depth of eight (8)
inches at least twice each day for three (3) consecutive good drying days.
      (4)   All areas processed per the above paragraph shall be recompacted in
order to achieve not less than ninety-five percent (95%) density, or until at
least nine (9) passes have been made utilizing a roller that has demonstrated
its ability to obtain the required density on adjacent earthwork.
   (C)   In areas requiring the construction of roadway embankment, and where
said embankment will be less than one and one-half (1 ½) feet in height, all
filling shall be done in lifts that do not exceed eight (8) inches loose
thickness, and that are compacted to not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of
the standard laboratory density.
      (1)   If the embankment height is between one and one-half (1 ½) feet and
three (3) feet inclusive, the first lift shall be compacted to not less than
ninety percent (90%), and the balance to a minimum of ninety-five percent (95%)
of the standard laboratory density.
      (2)   If the embankment exceeds three (3) feet in height, the lower one-
third (1/3) of the embankment, but not more than two (2) feet, shall be
compacted in a manner that will yield a minimum of ninety percent (90%) of
standard laboratory density to the uppermost lift of that portion of the
embankment. The next one (1) foot of embankment shall be compacted to not less
than ninety-three percent (93%), and the balance of the embankment compacted to
not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the standard laboratory density.

one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the optimum moisture determined according
to AASHTO T 99 (Method C).
   (F)   Compaction shall be achieved with a roller capable of properly
compacting the given type of embankment material; in the case of fine-grained
soils, a sheeps-foot roller shall be deemed suitable.
34-3-13 LIME MODIFICATION.
   All streets shall be constructed with a lime-modified subgrade to a depth of
at least eight (8) inches.
   (A)   Lime used for this purpose shall be proportioned within a range of two
percent (2%) to six percent (6%) of soil (oven dry basis).
   (B)   The loose thickness of a single lime modified layer shall not exceed
eight (8) inches if a disk harrow is used, or fourteen (14) inches if rotary
speed mixer is used.
   (C)   Lime shall not be applied when wind conditions are such that blowing
lime becomes objectionable to adjacent property owners, or creates a hazard to
traffic on adjacent highways.
   (D)   For all Residential Street Applications, in lieu of lime modification
sub-grade, four (4) inches of crushed stone with underlayment may be used.
Requirements of Section
34-3-12 apply.
34-3-14 GRANULAR SUB-BASE.
   Where granular sub-base is required, the Subdivider/Developer shall use CA-
6 sub-base aggregate granular material, Type A, conforming Section 311 -
Granular Sub-base of the IDOT Standard Specifications.
   (A)   The sub-base shall be constructed in layers not more than four (4)
inches thick when compacted, provided, however, that if tests indicate that the
desired results are being obtained, the compacted thickness of any layer may be
increased to a maximum of eight (8) inches.
   (B)   In the event it is necessary to undercut the subgrade due to soft or
spongy areas, CA-3 aggregate shall be used as fill in order to bring the
subject area to subgrade elevation.
   (C)   The granular material shall be compacted to not less than ninety-five
percent (95%) of the standard laboratory density.
      (1)   The standard laboratory density shall be the maximum density
determined according to AASHTO T 99 (Method A or C).
      (2)   A coarse particle correction according AASHTO T 224 will be used
with Method A and may be used with Method C.
   (D)   Equipment used for placement of granular sub-base shall consist of
either a suitable spreader box or by the blading of end-dumped or tailgated
material, provided however, that the latter method will be allowed only if it
can be accomplished without undue segregation of the material.
34-3-15 COMPACTION VERIFICATION.
   The developer shall be responsible for providing soils testing results to
the Village Engineer to verify compliance with the above stated compaction
requirements.
   (A)   In general, soils tests shall be taken every two hundred (200) feet,
eight (8) feet off of the centerline; at intersecting streets; and at sag (low)
points.
   (B)   A written report from a Registered Professional Engineer, certifying
that soils throughout the embankment and subgrade material uniformly meet the
compaction requirements, shall be provided to the Village at least twenty-four
(24) hours prior to paving or pouring curb and gutter.
34-3-16 STANDARDS FOR STREETS.
   All streets under the jurisdiction of the Village shall be classified by the
Village and said classification shall determine the standards to which said
streets must be constructed. If the proper classification of any street is
unknown, or if a new street is proposed for construction, the Village shall
review the existing or proposed street and thereafter establish a
classification.
   (A)   As a general rule, the design of all streets within any subdivision
shall be properly integrated with the Village’s existing and proposed street
system, and all work, installation, procedures and testing shall conform to the
specifications contained in the latest edition of the Illinois Department of
Transportation “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction”,
hereinafter referred to as IDOT Standard Specifications, with the provisions of
this Article, and with the specifications set forth in Table 31.

arterial street by a planting strip, but having access thereto at suitable
points.
(Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
   (D)   New residential streets shall be planned and laid out to discourage
traffic from existing or proposed arterial and/or collector streets adjacent to
the subdivision from using non-arterial or non-collector streets to “cut
through” the subdivision to destinations not within the subdivision.
   Any combination of curvilinear U-shaped, or modified grid system streets may
be utilized to affect a more desirable street layout, and minimize “cut
through” traffic between streets outside the subdivision while encouraging
connectivity within the subdivision.
   Whenever a proposed residential development independently or in conjunction
with another adjoining residential development collectively exceeds one hundred
twenty-five (125) lots/dwelling units in size, it shall be required to have two
(2) or more entrances into the proposed development which connect to secondary,
collector or arterial streets, with a new street or to a secondary, collector
or arterial street in the existing or adjoining development. The same
requirement shall apply to a commercial or industrial development containing
ten (10) or more lots.

than seventy (70) degrees.
      (2)   An oblique street shall be curved as it approaches an intersection
so that it is approximately at right angles with said intersection for a
distance of at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom, unless the Subdivider’s
engineer recommends, and the Village Engineer and/or administrator concurs,
that a lesser distance would in accordance with safe and accepted traffic
engineering practices.
   (C)   Proposed new intersections along one (1) side an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, align with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street.

for a distance of at least seventy-five (75) feet from the centerline said
intersection the grade does not exceed three percent (3%).
   (G)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or existing
vegetation in a triangular area depicted herein on the Standard Specification
Plan Sheets, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation, including
trees, in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way.

with accessibility rules and regulations.
      (7)   All ramps at intersections and other hazardous vehicular ways shall
have a detectable warning texture.
      (8)   When a sidewalk intersects with the top of a storm sewer inlet
cover, the inlet cover dimension perpendicular to the street shall be increased
so that the edge of said cover which is parallel to and furthest away from the
street, is aligned with the edge of the sidewalk furthest away from the street,
thereby incorporating the inlet cover into the sidewalk, as depicted on the
Standard Specification Plan Sheets. This provision shall not be required if the
parkway between the sidewalk and curb is wide enough to allow an inlet cover
independent of the sidewalk.
   (B)   In residential areas, sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in
width. (Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
      (1)   Said sidewalks shall be located thirty (30) inches behind the curb
along streets, and twelve (12) inches behind the curb around the radii of cul-
de-sacs and curves.
      (2)   Because driveways in a new residential subdivision cannot be
effectively located until lots are sold and developed thereby inhibiting the
initial installation of sidewalks throughout the development, the Subdivider/
Developer may require that individual owners install sidewalks in accordance
with these provisions at the same time that the owner’s driveway is
constructed. However, as sidewalk connectivity is a priority within residential
subdivisions, sidewalks will be installed within twenty-four (24) months of the
recording date of the final plat. After the twenty-four (24) month period has
expired, owners may petition the Village Board for extension for the sidewalk
installation. Said request shall be accompanied by a date certain sidewalk
installation date not to exceed twelve (12) months. (Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
      (3)   Failure to do so by the owner shall not release the Subdivider/
Developer from the ultimate responsibility for installation of said sidewalks.
      (4)   Time frame for completion of sidewalks to be determined at time of
approval of plan.
   (C)   In commercial and other non-residential areas, sidewalks shall be a
minimum of five (5) feet in width.
      (1)   Because of safety considerations in said areas, sidewalks shall be
located as far as practical from the traffic lanes, usually abutting the right-
of-way line.
34-3-29 SPECIFICATIONS FOR STREET SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be purchased by the Subdivider/Developer for all
intersections within or abutting any subdivision.
   (A)   Said signs shall be of flat .080 aluminum with engineering grade
sheeting and measure six (6) inches in height and no less than twenty-four (24)

Village for installation by the Village no later than the date on which the
first home within said subdivision is occupied.
   (E)   A street that is a continuation of an existing street, or obviously in
alignment with an existing street, shall bear the same name as the existing
street.
   (F)   The names of new streets shall be significantly different in sound and
spelling from the names of existing streets in the Village so as to avoid
confusion, and shall be approved by the County 911 Coordinator prior to the
ordering of said signs.
34-3-30 DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC USE.
   Every Subdivider/Developer shall dedicate for public use, at least the
minimum right-of-way indicated in the street design specifications contained
herein.
   (A)   The Village Engineer may require a Subdivider/Developer to dedicate
right-of-way in excess of the stated minimum if, in his professional opinion,
he feels that:
      (1)   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate site lines; or
      (2)   Due to the location of streams and railroad tracks, additional
width is needed to construct bridges, underpasses, and/or safe approaches
thereto.
   (B)   Whenever a subdivision abuts an existing street that does not meet the
street design specifications contained herein, the Subdivider/Developer shall
reserve sufficient right-of-way along the street abutting the subdivision so
that, when additional right-of-way is acquired on the other site, compliance
with said standards will be possible.
   (C)   Any land that is dedicated or reserved for public rights-of-way shall
not be counted in determining compliance with the lot size and setback
requirements set forth in the Zoning Code.
   (D)   Upon the effective date of this Code, it shall be unlawful to create
any private street within the subdivision jurisdiction of the Village.
34-3-31 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT REQUIRED.
   (A)   Any person, firm, corporation or other entity proposing to construct
buildings or develop land within the jurisdiction of the Village shall prepare,
for review by the Village Engineer, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan
that describes the manner in which erosion, sediment and runoff resulting from
the development will be controlled and managed. The provisions of this Section
shall be applicable to the following developments:
      (1)   Any residential development having a gross aggregate of five (5)
acres or more; or
      (2)   Any residential development of less than five (5) acres but with at
least fifty percent (50%) impervious surface including roads, building, utility
right-of-way and other improvements; or
      (3)   Any commercial, industrial, institutional or utility development
that has a gross aggregate area of one-half (1/2) acre or more.
   (B)   No building or construction permits or plat approval shall be issued
by the Village until the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan has been
reviewed by the Village Engineer as meeting the requirements of this Code, or
the requirement for such Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan has been waived
by the Village Engineer.
   (C)   Downstream property owners, watercourses, channels, or conduits shall
not receive storm water runoff from proposed upstream developments at a higher
peak flow rate than would have resulted from the same storm event occurring
over the site of the proposed development with the land in its natural,
undeveloped conditions, nor shall storm water runoff exceed the capacity of the
natural drainage system.
   (D)   Storm water runoff resulting from a proposed development shall be
detained on-site:
      (1)   By wet or dry bottom reservoirs;
      (2)   By underground reservoirs;
      (3)   On flat roofs, parking lots, or streets; or
      (4)   By other detention methods reviewed by the Village Engineer.
   (E)   For purposes of designing adequate on-site detention facilities, the
Illinois State Water Survey Bulletin 70 rainfall data for this region shall be
used.
   (F)   Detention Basins.
   Detention basins may be constructed to temporarily detain the storm water
runoff so that the rate at which it is released is the same rate as before
development. The following features shall be incorporated into the design of
any detention basin:
      (1)   The volume of storage provided shall be sufficient to store flows
both during and immediately after the maximum storm event which can be expected
to occur once every two (2) and one hundred (100) years.
      (2)   Outlet works shall be designated to limit peak outflow rates from
detention storage areas to or below peak flow rates that would have occurred
prior to the proposed development. Due to the potential for maintenance
problems associated with small diameter outfall pipes from detention
facilities, no outfall pipe smaller than four (4) inches in diameter shall be
used.
      (3)   Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices
and shall function without requiring attendance or control during operation.
      (4)   Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe passage of
runoff generated from a 100 year storm.
      (5)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored shall not normally
exceed four (4) feet.
      (6)   The maximum side slopes for grassed basins shall not exceed one (1)
foot vertical for three (3) feet horizontal (3:1 slope).
      (7)   In no case shall the limits of maximum ponding be closer than
thirty (30) feet horizontally from any building and less than two (2) feet
vertically below the lowest sill elevation.
      (8)   The basin bottom should be designed to drain expeditiously. If the
bottom is to be grass, it should have a minimum slope of one percent (1%).
      (9)   Small flows through the detention basin should be handled by paved
ditches from inflow structures to outflow structures to minimize erosion.
      (10)   If the detention basin is to have other uses, the design of the
basin bottom should include under drains to expedite drying of the bottom
between runoff events.
      (11)   Designs should result in aesthetically pleasing configurations
that will enhance public acceptability.
      (12)   Outfall storm sewer structures for detention ponds and basins
shall be piped through lots.
   (G)   Retention Ponds.

to temporarily detain the differential runoff from the development. In addition
to the general design features for detention basins as listed above, the
following should also be incorporated into the design of any retention pond.
(Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18)
      (1)   In order to minimize weed growth, the normal pool depth should be
four (4) feet minimum.
      (2)   If fish are to be kept in the pond, at least one-quarter (1/4) of
the area of the permanent pool should have a minimum depth of ten (10) feet.
      (3)   In order to ease cleaning of the pond or shoreline maintenance, the
pond design should include provisions for emptying the pond.
      (4)   The design of any pond may include a low flow by-pass channel or
pipeline to divert runoff that can be accommodated by downstream drainageways.
      (5)   In order to minimize the effects of waves or ice, some type of bank
stabilization such as rip rap or concrete should be placed along the normal
pool shoreline.
      (6)   The side slopes below the normal pool elevation may exceed the
maximum side slope permitted above normal pool. The design shall, however,
include provisions for a safety ledge having a depth of water not greater than
three (3) feet immediately adjacent to the shoreline.
      (7)   Outfall storm sewer structures for detention ponds and basins shall
be piped through lots.
   (H)   Rooftop Storage.
   Detention storage may be met in total or in part by detention on roofs.
Details of such design, which shall be included in the Building Permit
Application, shall include the depth and volume of storage, details of outlet
devices and down drains, elevations of overflow scuppers, design loadings for
the roof structure and emergency overflow provisions. Direct connection of roof
drains to sanitary sewers is prohibited.
   (I)   Other Detention Methods.
   All or a portion of the detention storage may also be provided in
underground or surface detention facilities, to include basins, tanks, or
swales.
   (J)   Safety Features.
   The design of detention facilities shall incorporate safety features,
particularly at outlets, on steep slopes, and at any attractive nuisances to
include, as necessary, fencing, handrails, lighting, steps, grills, signs and
other protective or warning devices so as to restrict access during critical
periods and to afford some measure of safety to both authorized and
unauthorized persons.
   (K)   The storm water detention facilities must be built in conjunction with
the storm sewer installation and be fully operational after the clearing of
vegetation.
      (1)   Silt and debris connected with early construction shall be removed
-periodically from the detention area to maintain full storage capacity.
      (2)   The maintenance responsibility of the detention area shall remain
with the developer and/or contractor until final inspection and applicable
escrows are released.
      (3)   Before plat approval, the developer shall submit his plan for
future maintenance responsibility of the detention area.
   (L)   Sump Pump Drainage.
      (1)   Sump pump drainage lines shall be required for all new
subdivisions.
      (2)   The pipe system for sump pump drainage shall consist of six (6)
inch diameter Schedule 35 PVC at a minimum depth of thirty-six (36) inches. A
clean out shall be located every four hundred (400) feet or less, at every
change in direction, and at every junction of two or more lines. The piping
system shall be connected to the drainage facility within the subdivision.
Slope shall be a minimum one percent (1%).
      (3)   All service lines to the main shall be privately owned and
maintained and shall be a minimum of one and one-half (1 ½) inch diameter.
      (4)   All connections to the sump pump drainage system shall be a tee
fitting cut into the system and inspected by the Village.
      (5)   The sump pump drainage lines are intended for sump pump drainage
only. Surface drainage shall not be allowed into sump line.
      (6)   Discharges from sump pumps are prohibited on village streets,
sidewalks, and alleys if these cause hazardous conditions to pedestrians,
automobiles, or bicyclists. Hazardous conditions shall include, but not limited
to, creating an ice hazard in freezing temperatures or creating a falling
hazard due to slickness of the sidewalk during non-freezing temperatures.
Discharges from sump pumps shall be relocated so that the hazard to the street
or sidewalk is eliminated at the direction of the Public Works Director or
Village Engineer.
      (7)   Sump pump drainage lines shall be connected and operable before any
frame construction begins.

      (1)   Proposed subdivisions shall contain active and passive green space.
Such green space shall be owned (either in fee simple or by perpetual
easement), supervised, managed, and maintained by the developer, subdivision
property owner(s) or homeowner’s association. The green space shall consist of
active and passive green space, whether developed for recreational uses or not,
but shall not include water retention, water detention, or other storm water
management areas; however, ponds, lakes or natural wetlands that are part of
the storm water management system shall be considered as green space. Green
space must be accessible to all lots via rights-of-way or easements to preclude
having to cross private land. Creative uses of green space will be encouraged.
      (2)   The subdivision’s covenants and restrictions shall include language
to the effect that, if the property owner(s) fail to maintain the green space,
the Village has the authority to maintain the green space and impose a lien on
each lot in the subdivision for its share of the maintenance costs. The
developer shall have the duty to maintain the green space until such time as
seventy percent (70%) of the lots have been sold or individual property owners
control the association. However, the developer shall be responsible for
construction details and construction quality of green space areas for a two
(2) year period.
      (3)   As part of developer’s site plan approval responsibilities,
developers shall be responsible for the improvements to the development for
active and passive green space purposes including, but not limited to finished
grade and ground cover for all green spaces within their development.
      (4)   In a phased subdivision the developer must provide the required
green space for the subdivision in proportional amounts for each phase of the
development. The amount of green space exceeding the requirements in a
completed phase may be applied toward any future phase of the subdivision.
   (B)   Minimum Green Space Requirements.
   The amount of green space to be contained in subdivisions shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Single Family Residential Districts (SR-1, SR-2).   Ten percent
(10%) of the total area of the subdivision, which shall consist of four percent
(4%) of the total area as passive green space and six percent (6%) of the total
area as active green space.
      (2)   Multiple Family Dwelling District (MR-1, MR-2).   Twenty percent
(20%) of the total area of the subdivision, which shall consist of eight
percent (8%) of the total area as passive green space and twelve percent (12%)
of the total area as active green space.
      (3)   All Other Districts.   Four percent (4%) of the total area of the
subdivision, which shall consist of passive green or active green space all of
which shall be provided within the subdivision.
   (C)   Compliance with Green Space Requirements.
   In providing for the required areas of green space within the subdivision,
the required amount of passive green space must be provided within the
boundaries of the proposed subdivision. The required amount of active green
space may be provided in the following ways:
      (1)   Construction/reserve of the active/passive green space within the
development;
      (2)   A cash contribution in lieu of constructing/reserving active/
passive green space may be made by the developer to the Park Improvement Fund.
The amount to be paid to the fund shall be determined pursuant to a formula
established by the Village, which formula multiplies the acreage amount of
green space required in the subdivision or development multiplied by Twenty
Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) per acre; (Ord. No. 18-01; 01-09-18; Ord. No. 23-
005; 3-13-23)
      (3)   A combination of subparagraph (1) and (2) above as approved by the
Board of Trustees; or
      (4)   By separate written agreement between the Village and the owner/
developer in which the owner/developer agrees to pay the Park Improvement Fund
the sum of Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00) per lot to be developed in a
SR-1 or SR-2 District or Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per dwelling unit in a
MR-1 or MR-2 District. However, if at least three percent (3%) of the required
active green space in a SR-1 or SR-2 District is provided in the subdivision,
the payment of the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per lot shall be
paid; or if at least six percent (6%) of the required active green space in a
MR-1 or MR-2 District is provided in the subdivision, the sum of One Hundred
Fifty Dollars ($150.00) per dwelling unit shall be paid. One-half (½) of said
amounts shall be paid at the time of approval of the final plat of the
subdivision. The remaining amount due shall be paid within one (1) year of the
date of the approval of the final plat. If either payment is not made the
Village shall have the right to proceed against the acceptable form of
assurance of compliance referred to in Section
34-4-24  of this Code.
   (D)   Protection of Green Space.
   Green space shall be protected from development through platting, deed
restrictions or restrictive covenants which will ensure its perpetual use as a
green space as defined in the Code and which further provided that no changes
in use may be made without the express written consent of the Village.
   (E)   Creation of the Park Improvement Fund.
   There is hereby established a new fund to be known as the Park Improvement
Fund. The monies of this Fund shall be used solely for acquisition of new
ground for parks and/or capital improvement of existing parks as authorized and

36-1-12 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with the applicable interest on the
underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of
the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk’s Office.
36-1-14 LIENS.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   timely remove the lien at the Village’s expense;
   (B)   correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
   (C)   correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
36-1-15 LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.
   This Chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all
of the Village’s tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this Chapter, this Chapter shall be
controlling.

Article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information
as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The

or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this Section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this State shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

CHAPTER 40
ZONING CODE
ARTICLE I – PURPOSE AND INTERPRETATION
40-1-1 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   In accordance with state law, this Chapter regulates lots, structures and
uses in order to preserve, protect and promote the public health, safety and
welfare and to implement the Village comprehensive plan. More specifically,
this Chapter is intended to assist in achieving the following objectives:
   (A)   To expand economic opportunities and strengthen the community tax
base. This will require a concentrated effort and support of effective programs
for economic development. Existing agricultural support business should be
maintained. Heavy industrial uses should be eliminated and commercial
activities compatible with residential growth should be encouraged.
   (B)   To promote efficiency in the use of land. Efficiency in the use of
land will conserve land resources. This will minimize the cost of public
services and utilities while permitting a higher standard of service.
   (C)   To develop and enhance a community spirit and identity. People must
identify themselves with a community before they feel they are part of the
community. Traditions and pride must be encouraged if the residents are to
unite and promote the best interests of their community.
   (D)   To upgrade the housing types throughout the Village. Conservation,
rehabilitation and redevelopment techniques should be utilized as an overall
program for upgrading the Village's housing stock. Quality housing must be
provided for prospective residents as population increases occur.
   (E)   To provide a healthful community environment and a full range of
municipal or public amenities and services. Community utilities and facilities
have been upgraded and extended in order to attract new residents to the
community. As development increases, such utilities should be monitored and
provided for.
   (F)   To continue the development of an efficient street and transportation
system for movement of people and goods within, to and from the community.
Development of street and highway system should be coordinated so that the
movement of people and goods will be convenient, safe and in context with
overall community needs.
   (G)   To achieve understanding and support of the planning program. By
providing a broad range of opportunity for citizen participation in public
decisions, an increased understanding of the function and problems of the local
government will develop. The continuous process of citizen participation
results in public acceptance and support of the various planning insures and of
the plan itself, thereby providing the community with a better environmental
quality. (Purpose and Goal of Zoning Regulations (Comprehensive Plan), as
adopted the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Village Board of Trustees, Joint
meeting, January 28, 2002).
   (H)   To provide for the efficient administration and fair enforcement of
all the regulations in this Chapter.
(Ord. No. 17-11; 12-12-17)
40-1-2     APPLICABILITY OF PROVISIONS.
   This Chapter shall be applicable to all lands within the corporate limits of
the Village. Outside of the corporate limits, the unincorporated territory
within one and one-half (1 1/2) miles of the Village is subject to the Madison
County Zoning Code (enacted pursuant to Illinois statutes). Consequently, if
proper application is made to Madison County for an interpretation of the
building and zoning administrator or for a variance, special use permit, text
amendment or rezoning, similar proceedings need not be initiated with the
Village. However, in such cases, the Village is entitled to notice from Madison
County.
40-1-3     INTERPRETATION; CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Chapter, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety,
health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare. It is not
intended by this Chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any ordinances,
rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued, and not in conflict
with any of the provisions of this Chapter, or which shall be adopted or issued
pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or premises and likewise not
in conflict with this Chapter, nor is it intended by this Chapter to interfere
with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between
parties; except, that if this Chapter imposes a greater restriction, this
Chapter shall control.
40-1-4     DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Except as may be provided otherwise by statute or ordinance, no official,
board member, agent, or employee of the Village shall render himself or herself
personally liable for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a
result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his or her duties
under this Chapter. Any suit brought against any official, board member, agent
or employee of the Village, as a result of any act required or permitted in the
discharge of his or her duties under this Chapter, shall be defended by the
Village until the final determination of the legal proceedings.

lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions,
shall be determined by the use of a scale appearing on the district map. Where
a district boundary divides a platted lot, the zone classification of the
greater portion shall prevail throughout the lot.
   (D)   Uncertainty Settled by Zoning Hearing Officer.
   In case any further uncertainty exists, the Zoning Hearing Officer shall
interpret the intent of the zoning map as to the location of such boundaries.
   (E)   Street and Right-of-Way Abandonments.
   Where a public road, street alley or other right of way is officially
vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it
reverted shall apply.
   (F)   Excluded Areas.
   Unless areas are classified on or by the official zoning map of the Village
or the appropriate classification can be established by the rules above, such
areas shall be considered to classified A - Agricultural district, until such
time as the land is rezoned by the Village Board of Trustees.
40-3-4 CHART OF DIMENSIONAL REGULATIONS.
   The chart of Dimensional Regulations is added as a supplement to this
Chapter. Should there be any conflict between the text of this Chapter and the
information displayed in the chart, the text of this Chapter shall prevail.
40-3-5 ZONING OF ANNEXED AREAS.
   Any territory hereafter annexed to the Village shall automatically be zoned
as SR-1 single-family residential district, until duly changed by an amendment
to this Chapter except under the following condition: the Village Board, with
the recommendation of the Zoning Hearing Officer, may annex any territory as
any other zoning district or districts herein established if all legal
requirements for zoning the property at the time of the annexation are
recorded.
*In the Table below, to accommodate improved functionality of building side
yards, the Zoning Code allows for side yard distances in the A, SR-1, SR-2 and
MR-1 to meet a “per side” minimum (the “either” amount in the “Minimum Side
Yard Abutting a Lot” column) and an “overall distance” minimum (the “both”
amount in the same column). For example, in the SR-1 zoning district, side
yards must be a minimum of ten (10) feet per side while the total combined side
yard widths must equal twenty-five (25) feet. This flexibility allows building
foundations to be shifted to accommodate side entry garages, for example, while
retaining overall uniformity.

ARTICLE IV - GENERAL ZONING REGULATIONS
40-4-1 REGULATION OF USES.
   It is the intent of this Chapter to permit certain uses, not otherwise
illegal, to locate in specified zoning districts, either as a permitted use or
a special use.
   (A)   Permitted Uses.
   No structure shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed or structurally
altered, nor shall any structure or land or combination thereof be used unless
the use to which the structure and/or land is to be put is listed in the
permitted use section of the applicable zoning district and the use fully
complies with all of the applicable district regulations, except for
nonconformity’s, accessory uses, and special uses.
   (B)   Special Uses.
   No special use, as designated within this Chapter, shall hereafter be
established unless such use has been approved pursuant to the provisions of
Article XIII of this Chapter. Any existing use which was a permitted use prior
to the adoption of this Chapter and which is designated as a special use by
this Chapter may continue as if it were approved as a special use.
   (C)   Uses Not Specifically Listed.
   In the event a particular use is not listed anywhere in this Chapter and
such use is not an accessory use, then it shall be considered to be not allowed
within the Village. Questions concerning such uses may be referred to the
Zoning Hearing Officer, unless by written order of the Village Board it is
determined that said use is similar to and is compatible with the uses listed
and is expressly included as a use permitted in a zoning district. However, no
such order may made by the Village Board without first having a public hearing,
in the manner prescribed in this Chapter, before the Zoning Hearing Officer.
Any such proposed variation which to receive the approval of the Zoning Hearing
Officer shall not be ordered except by a favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of
all the Trustees.
40-4-2     SIZE, DIMENSION AND ACCESS CRITERIA.
   In order to carry out the purpose and intent and provisions of the Chapter,
size and dimension criteria for particular zoning districts are hereby
established. Such size and dimension criteria shall be applied in accordance
with section and other applicable provisions of this Chapter.
   (A)   Lot Size Requirements.
      (1)   Reduction Of Lot Size Or Yards.
   No lot or yard existing on the effective date of this Chapter shall
thereafter be reduced in size, dimension, or area below the minimum
requirements set out herein, except by reason of a portion being acquired for
public use in any manner, including dedication, condemnation, or purchase. Lots
or yards created after the effective date of this Chapter shall meet the
minimum requirements established herein.
      (2)   Applicability to All Uses.
   Unless otherwise specified in this Chapter, all permitted uses and all
special uses shall be subject to the lot size requirements specified for a
given district, unless other minimum requirements are specified for such uses
elsewhere in this Chapter.
      (3)   Structure Built On Two Lots. A building constructed on a site
consisting of two (2) lots must be located either within the required setback
from the common or center lot line, or the building must be constructed on both
lots.
      (4)   Lots Of Record Less Than Minimum Size.
   Any lot of record at the time of the adoption of this Chapter which contains
less lot area or width than required in the district in which it is located may
be used for a use in such district; provided, that the lot has a minimum width
forty (40) feet. This provision shall not be construed to permit more than one
dwelling unit on a lot with less lot area per family than required for the
district in which such lot is located. (Ord. No. 2017-11; 12-12-17)
      (5)   Use of Lots in Single-Family Districts.
   In single-family districts, every building hereafter erected or structurally
altered shall be located on a “lot” as herein defined, and in no case shall
there be more than the principal building and the customary accessory buildings
on one lot or parcel of land.
      (6)   When two (2) or more parcels of land, each of which lacks adequate
area and/or minimum dimensions to qualify for a permitted use under the
requirements of the use district in which they are located, are contiguous, and
are held in one ownership, they shall be used a one zoning lot for such use.
(Ord. No. 2017-11; 12-12-17)
   (B)   Minimum Yard Requirements.
      (1)   Generally.
   Minimum yard requirements shall be as specified for a given zoning district.
The yard requirements shall apply to all buildings and structures, as they
relate to the respective lot lines, except as otherwise specifically provided
in this Chapter or as exempted in subsection (B)(2) of this Section.
      (2)   Exemptions.
   The following structures shall be exempt from the minimum yard requirements,
set forth in this Chapter: underground utility equipment, clotheslines,
flagpoles, regulation mailboxes, traffic signals, fire hydrants, light poles or
and similar structure of device (Also see Article XI of this Chapter).
   (C)   Maximum Building Height.
   Maximum building height of thirty-five (35) feet shall apply to all
structures located in the zoning district except those structures and
appurtenances excluded in Article XI of this Chapter or special uses which have
a maximum height specified in this Chapter.
   (D)   Access Required.
   Every building shall be constructed or erected upon a lot or parcel of land
which abuts and has access to a public street, unless a permanent access
easement to a public street was of record prior to the effective date hereof.
If access is not provided to a public street or similar easement, the property
must be subdivided to ensure access. (Ord. No. 2017-11; 12-12-17)

ARTICLE IX - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE (PDP)
40-9-1 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The planned development procedure or PDP is intended to provide for
development incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses, which are
planned and developed as a unit. A PDP development may consist of
conventionally subdivided lots or provide for nontraditional techniques of
development, which are consistent with the intent of the Village comprehensive
plan and meet the spirit and intent of this Chapter. The further purpose of the
PDP is to permit the following:
   (A)   A maximum choice in the type of environment available to the public by
allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict application
of the provisions of this Chapter.
   (B)   Permanent preservation of common open space and recreation areas and
facilities.
   (C)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features.
   (D)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development and design and the construction of aesthetic
amenities.
   (E)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and other
facilities.
   (F)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals
and welfare.
   (G)   Innovations in residential, commercial, and recreational development
so that growing demands of population may be met by greater variety in type,
design, and layout of buildings and by the conservation and more efficient use
of open space ancillary to said buildings.
40-9-2 SIZE, DENSITY AND USE CONTROLS.  
   (A)   The minimum size of any PDP shall be one (1) acre, unless the proposed
PDP abuts an existing PDP, in which case, the minimum size may be waived if the
Village determines that the proposed and existing PDP uses are compatible.
   (B)   For PDPs in residentially zoned areas, the maximum residential density
of any PDP shall be controlled by the underlying zoning district(s) and the
maximum floor area ratios shall apply (See Section
40-9-6(H)). Non-residential uses within residentially zoned areas shall not be
allowed as part of the PDP review process.
   (C)   For PDPs in non-residentially zoned areas, the maximum building
coverage shall be controlled by the percentage allowed within the underlying
zoning district. Residential uses within non-residentially zoned areas may be
allowed as part of the PDP review process.
(Ord. No. 2017-11; 12-12-17)
40-9-3 APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND AREA PLAN.
   (A) PDP Pre-Application Meeting.
   Before submitting a PDP application, developers, owners, and/or their
representatives, are encouraged to meet with the appropriate Village officials
to discuss the proposal. The purpose of the meeting is to review a conceptual
building and street layout of the property and give Village staff and the
owner, developer, and/or their representatives an opportunity to address
questions or concerns prior to formal submittal of the PDP. Identification of
questions and concerns will assist Village officials in determining how the
proposal fits with current zoning and future land use plans per the Village
Comprehensive Plan, and how property will be served by public roads, utilities,
and services. The meeting will also assist the Zoning Hearing Officer in
ensuring he/she will have the information needed to properly conduct the Public
Hearing and prepare a written report to the Village Board per Section
40-9-4.
   (B)   Application Required.
      (1)   Filing.
   The amendment of an area plan or the designation of a portion of the Village
as a planned development must be initiated by an application with the proposed
area plan, accompanied by the required fee and filed with the building and
zoning administrator. The owner or owners of record or the contract purchasers
must verify the application. The application must be filed at least thirty (30)
days prior to the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting at which it is to be first
considered.
   (C)   Contents of Application.
   The application must include the following information. The Village may
require that this information be included on or filed with designated forms:
      (1)   The name of the proposed PDP development.

40-9-4 REVIEW OF APPLICATION AND AREA PLAN.
   (A)   The proposed plan shall be referred to the Zoning Hearing Officer for
study, a public hearing thereon and recommendation and report to the Village
Board of Trustees.
   (B)   The Zoning Hearing Officer shall not act on any proposed plan before
holding a public meeting with fifteen (15) days’ written notice thereof shall
be given to all property owners within two hundred fifty (250) feet (not
including the width(s) of public right-of-way) of the boundary of the premises
under consideration, and at least fifteen (15) days’ written notice thereof
shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village.
   (C)   After holding a public hearing on any proposed plan, the Zoning
Hearing Officer shall submit his/her report of such action to the Village Board
of Trustees for the Board’s consideration and action within thirty (30) days of
the public hearing. Said report shall include all documents comprising the
proposed plan referred to the Zoning Hearing Officer, the recommendation of the
Zoning Hearing Officer with respect to such proposed plan, and the reasons for
approval or disapproval of such proposed plan. The Zoning Hearing Officer’s
report shall address his/her recommendation shall be based upon whether the
plan is consistent with good general planning practice, consistent with good
site planning, can be constructed and operated in a manner that is not
detrimental to the permitted uses in the district, would be visually compatible
with the uses in the surrounding area, and is deemed desirable to promote the
general welfare of the Village. The Zoning Hearing Officer must also consider
architectural, landscape, traffic impacts and other relationships which may
exist between the proposed PDP development and the character of the surrounding
neighborhood and must prescribe or require such physical treatment or other
limitations as will, in its opinion, enhance the neighborhood character. The
Zoning Hearing Officer may also consider other relevant criteria or issues not
listed here that, in his/her opinion, may impact the PDP development and
surrounding properties.
   (D)   If no report is transmitted by the Zoning Hearing Officer within
thirty (30) days from the date that the application is first reviewed by the
Zoning Hearing Officer at a regular meeting, the Village Board of Trustees may
take action on such proposed plan even though the Zoning Hearing Officer has
not submitted its report to the board. If the Zoning Hearing Officer fails to
hold the public hearing required by subsection B of this Section, the Village
Board of Trustees may assume that responsibility and hold such a hearing after
providing the requisite notice.
   (E)   Upon receipt of the Zoning Hearing Officer’s report, the Village Board
of Trustees shall, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, either approve the
application by adopting an ordinance amending the zoning district map and
authorizing the PDP development in accordance with the area plan, or deny the
application. If the application is approved, the matter shall be returned to
the Zoning Hearing Officer for consideration of a final development plan.
   (F)   Minor technical and mechanical changes to the area plan may be
approved by the Village Engineer without review by the Zoning Hearing Officer
or the Village Board of Trustees so long as the changes do not materially
affect the PDP development as approved by the Village Board of Trustees. Within
seven (7) days of such approval, the Village Engineer will advise the chairman
of the Zoning Hearing Officer of any such change. By way of example, minor
technical and mechanical changes may include changes in locations of greenspace
or amounts of greenspace of five percent (5%) or less, changes in residential
density or lot coverage of five percent (5%) or less, parking amount and
exterior lighting plan changes, street layout or engineering revisions which do
not impact the character of the PDP, and changes of less than five percent (5%)
in approved exterior building materials.

good general planning practice, consistent with good site planning, can be
constructed and operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the permitted
uses in the district, would be visually compatible with the uses in the
surrounding area, and is deemed desirable to promote the general welfare of the
Village. The Zoning Hearing Officer must also consider architectural,
landscape, and other relationships which may exist between the proposed PDP
development and the character of the surrounding neighborhood and must
prescribe or require such physical treatment or other limitations as will, in
its opinion, enhance the neighborhood character. The Zoning Hearing Officer may
also consider other relevant criteria or issues not listed that, in his/her
opinion, may impact the PDP development and surrounding properties.

is first reviewed by the Zoning Hearing Officer at a regular meeting, the
Village Board of Trustees may approve or disapprove such plan even though the
Zoning Hearing Officer has taken no action.
   (E)   The Village Clerk shall retain all plans on file. An approved final
development plan will constitute an approved preliminary plat for purposes of
the land subdivision regulations. No building permits or authorization for
improvement or development for any use authorized under provisions of the
ordinance governing the tract shall be issued prior to approval of such plans.
   (F)   Where elements within the designated planned development boundary are
necessary to the support of a given section, but not included within the
section boundary, these elements shall be included on a site plan accompanying,
or a part of, the section plan.
   (G)   If a final development plan includes all the information required for
section plans, the section plan requirements may be waived.

remove any sign, upon notification to do so, shall, upon conviction, be subject
to the penalties provided for violation of Village ordinances. (See Section

DIVISION II - APPEALS
40-13-16 NATURE OF AN APPEALSection 9-2 APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Zoning Administrator in
any matter related to the interpretation or enforcement of any provision of
this Code may appeal to the Hearing Officer on a prescribed form. Every such
appeal shall be made and treated in accordance with Illinois law and the
provisions of this Division.  (65 ILCS 5/11-13-12)
40-13-17 FILING, RECORD TRANSMITTAL.
   Every appeal shall be made within forty-five (45) days of the matter
complained of by filing with the Administrator and the Hearing Officer a
written notice specifying the grounds for appeal. Every appeal shall also be
filed with the Soil and Water Conservation District pursuant to State law. Not
more than five (5) working days after the notice of appeal has been filed, the
Administrator shall transmit to the Hearing Officer all records pertinent to
the case. (65 ILCS 5/11-13-12 and 5/11-13-14) (70 ILCS 405/22.02A)
40-13-18 STAY OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   An appeal stays all further action on the matter being appealed unless the
Administrator certifies to the Hearing Officer after the notice of appeal has
been filed with him, that for reasons stated in the certificate, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, further action shall
not be stayed unless the Hearing Officer or the Circuit Court grants a
restraining order for due cause and so notifies the Administrator.  (65 ILCS 5/
11-13-12)
40-13-19 PUBLIC HEARING, NOTICE.
   The Hearing Officer shall hold a public hearing on every appeal within a
reasonable time after the filing of the appeal notice. At the hearing, any
interested party may appear and testify, either in person or by duly authorized
agent or attorney. Notice indicating the time, date, and place of the hearing,
and briefly describing the issue to be decided shall be given not more than
thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing:

   (B)   By certified mail to the applicant; and,
   (C)   By first-class mail to all owners of property contiguous to any
property affected by the appeal.
(65 ILCS 5/11-13-12)
40-13-20 DECISION BY HEARING OFFICER.
   The Hearing Officer shall render a recommendation on the appeal within
thirty (30) days after the hearing therein. The Hearing Officer may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or amend the decision or order appealed
from the extent and in the manner that they deem appropriate. In so doing, the
Hearing Officer has all the power of the Administrator. (65 ILCS 5/11-13-3 and
5/11-13-12)
   ED. NOTE: The Hearing Officer is delegated the task of hearing appeals from
the decisions of the Zoning Administrator or other official charged with
enforcement of an ordinance passed pursuant to the Zoning Enabling Act. This
may, for example, entail determining whether there has been a discontinuance of
a nonconforming use. It is important for the applicant to note the appeal
process because of the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies
before suit is filed as well as the more obvious reason of using a less
expensive administrative process for correcting a mistake or error which may
have been made by the zoning administrator. (65 ILCS 5/11-13-3)
40-13-21 -  40-13-23 RESERVED.

40-13-24 VARIANCES.
   (A)   A variance is a relaxation of the requirements of this Code that are

upon the evidence presented to them, that:
   (A)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted
to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in that zone;
and
   (B)   The plight of the owner is due to peculiar circumstances; and
   (C)   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality. (65 ILCS 5/11-13-4 and 5/11-13-5)
   [NOTE: A variation shall be recommended only if in the judgment of the
Hearing Officer sustains each of the three conditions above.]

Officer. [NOTE: The Village Board takes action through the adoption of an
ordinance.]
