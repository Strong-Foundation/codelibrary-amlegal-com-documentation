as to any offense committed against such former ordinance or as to any act
done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred, or any right accrued
or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever to affect

or closed meeting of the village board via electronic means (such as by
telephone, video or internet connection) provided that such attendance is not
otherwise prohibited and is in compliance with these rules and any applicable
laws.
      2.   Prerequisites: A member of the village may attend a meeting
electronically if the member meets the following conditions:
         a.   The member must notify the clerk at least twenty four (24) hours
before the meeting, unless impractical, so that necessary communications
equipment can be arranged. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements will result in denial of a request for remote attendance.
         b.   The member must assert one of the following three (3) reasons why
he or she is unable to physically attend the meeting:
            (1)   The member cannot attend because of personal illness or
disability; or
            (2)   The member cannot attend because of employment purposes or
the business of the village; or
            (3)   The member cannot attend because of a family or other
emergency.
      3.   Authorization To Participate: The clerk, after receiving the
electronic attendance request, shall inform the village of the request for
electronic attendance. After establishing that there is a quorum physically
present at a meeting where a member of the village desires to attend
electronically, the presiding officer shall state that: a) a notice was
received by a member of the village in accordance with these rules, and b) the
member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting electronically unless a
motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance is made, seconded, and
approved by two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the village physically present
at the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if any such motion
fails to achieve the required vote by the members of the village physically
present at the meeting, then the request by the member to attend the meeting
electronically shall be deemed approved by the village and the presiding
officer shall declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by
the presiding officer, the question of a member's electronic attendance may not
be reconsidered.
      4.   Adequate Equipment Required: The member participating electronically
and other members of the village must be able to communicate effectively, and
members of the audience must be able to hear all communications at the meeting
site. Before allowing electronic attendance at any meeting, the village shall
provide equipment adequate to accomplish this objective at the meeting site.
      5.   Minutes: Any member attending electronically shall be considered an
off site attendee and counted as present electronically for that meeting if the
member is allowed to attend. The meeting minutes shall also reflect and state
specifically whether each member is physically present or present by electronic
means.
      6.   Rights Of Remote Member: A member permitted to attend electronically
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The member attending electronically shall be heard, considered, and counted as
to any vote taken. Accordingly, the name of any member attending electronically
shall be called during any vote taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded
by the clerk and placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member
attending electronically may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any
member, provided the member attending electronically shall announce his or her
leaving and returning.
      7.   Committees, Boards And Commissions: These rules shall apply to all
committees, boards and commissions established by authority of the village.
      8.   Participation While Driving Prohibited: Members permitted to attend
a meeting electronically may not participate while driving. Accordingly, if a
member meets all other criteria, but the only available method to attend the
meeting is by use of a cellular phone while driving, the member may not
participate.
      9.   Costs: A member participating remotely via telephone shall be
reimbursed for the cost of the telephone call upon a valid receipt shown. Any
other costs associated with remote participation, including video conferencing
and other audio and video equipment, must be previously approved by the
village.
      10.   Limited Participation Rights: Nothing herein shall prohibit an
official who does not meet the prerequisites of subsection E2 of this section
from participating in the meeting remotely, without voting rights, if the audio
or video equipment is available and a majority of those present do not vote
against the participation. Costs in such circumstances shall not be
reimbursable. (Ord. 2011-18, 11-7-2011)

recoverable costs as required by this chapter. (Ord. 2011-19, 12-6-2011)
1-9-7: DENIAL; REVOCATION:
The failure to pay in full when due any recoverable cost or deposit required

SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SECTION:
1-10-1:    Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-10-2: Definition Of Sexual Harassment
1-10-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-10-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations
1-10-5: Consequences Of A Violation Of The Prohibition On Sexual Harassment
1-10-6:    Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
1-10-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Sherman to prohibit harassment
of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or
municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 2020-
11, 6-2-2020)
1-10-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct
of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited too:
      1.   Verbal Harassment:   Sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
      2.   Non-Verbal Harassment: Suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls",
"smacking" or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: Posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical Harassment: Touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/Electronic Harassment: "Sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
   C.   The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person." (Ord. 2020-11, 6-2-2020)
1-10-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/
himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s)
as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
   B.   Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual
harassment, including the following:
      1.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassment
behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly
express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the
offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent
messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
      2.   Contact with Supervisory Personnel:
         a.   At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the
event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the
problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person
making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics
officer, the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality.
         b.   The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual
harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there
are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other
responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of
the harassment.
      3.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within three hundred (300) days
of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with
the EEOC must also be filed within three hundred (300) days.
   C.   Allegations of sexual harassment made against an elected official of
the governmental unit by another elected official of a governmental unit. In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   D.   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what
was said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not
limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
   E.   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 2020-
11, 6-2-2020)
1-10-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
or
      2.   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation; or
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge within three hundred (300) days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 2020-11, 6-2-2020)
1-10-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per offense, applicable
disciplinary actions or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines
and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal
law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed
by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by
an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency. (Ord. 2020-11, 6-2-2020)
1-10-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
   A.   A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
   B.   In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging
a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) against any
person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

1-11-1: PURPOSE:
The Village of Sherman provides whistleblower protections in two important
areas: confidentiality and against retaliation. The confidentiality of a
whistleblower will be maintained to the extent allowable by law, however, an
identity may have to be disclosed to conduct a thorough investigation, to
comply with the law and to provide accused individuals their legal rights of
defense. A whistleblower may also waive confidentiality in writing. The Village
will not retaliate against a whistleblower. This includes, but is not limited
to, protection from retaliation in the form of an adverse employment action
such as termination, compensation decreases, or poor work assignments and
threats of physical harm. Any whistleblowers who believe they are being
retaliated against must submit a written report to the Auditing Official within
sixty (60) days of gaining knowledge of the retaliatory action. The right of a
whistleblower for protection against retaliation does not include immunity for
any personal wrongdoing that is alleged and investigated. (Ord. 23-11, 11-7-
2023)
1-11-2: DEFINITIONS:

IMPROPER GOVERNMENTAL ACTION: Any action by an employee of the Village; an

public's health or safety; or, is a gross waste of public funds. The action
need not be within the scope of the employee's, elected official's, board
member's, commission member's or committee member's official duties to be
subject to a claim of "improper governmental action." Improper governmental
action does not include the Village's personnel actions, including, but not
limited to employee grievances, complaints, appointments, promotions,
transfers, assignments, reassignments, reinstatements, restorations,
reemployment, performance evaluations, reductions in pay, dismissals,
suspensions, demotions, reprimands or violations of collective bargaining

1-11-3: DUTIES OF AN AUDITING OFFICIAL:
Each Auditing Official shall establish written processes and procedures
consistent with the terms of this Policy and best practices for investigations

Official. The employee must exercise sound judgment to avoid baseless

determining fault or corrective measures; a designated Auditing Official is
charged with these responsibilities. (Ord. 23-11, 11-7-2023)

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and

shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall: (Ord. 2000-18, 12-19-2000; amd.

6-6-2: OBSCENITY:
   A.   Definition: Any material or performance is "obscene" if:
      1.   The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards,
would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and
      2.   The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards,
would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate
sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual
or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the
genitals; and
      3.   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value. (1984 Code §
9-3-2; amd. 2010 Code)
   B.   Elements Of The Offense: A person commits obscenity when, with
knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof,
he:
      1.   Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or
provide, any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or
embodiment of the obscene; or
      2.   Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or
participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
      3.   Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene;
or
      4.   Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition
of his body for gain; or
      5.   Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material with
intent to disseminate it in violation of this section, or of the penal laws or
regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
      6.   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or
held out by him to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   C.   Interpretation Of Evidence:
      1.   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults; except;
that, it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience. (1984 Code § 9-3-2)
      2.   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious, literary, artistic, political
or scientific value. (1984 Code § 9-3-2; amd. 2010 Code)
      3.   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence shall
be admissible to show:
         a.   The character of the audience for which the material was designed
or to which it was directed.

adults or a special audience, and what effect if any, it would probably have on
the behavior of such people.
         c.   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits
of the material, or absence thereof. (1984 Code § 9-3-2)
         d.   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in the
village. (1984 Code §
9-3-2; amd. 2010 Code)
         e.   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material.
         f.   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
   D.   Prima Facie Evidence: The creation, purchase, procurement or possession
of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted
for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three (3)
copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate.
   E.   Affirmative Defenses: It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      1.   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under eighteen (18) years of age.
      2.   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material. (1984 Code §
9-3-2)
   F.   Penalty: Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be
punished by a fine as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code for each offense, or in the event such person shall fail to

conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            (2)   The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including
the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
Village denies an application.
            (3)   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
Village and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after
notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional
application fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised application
within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is
deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30)
days of denial shall require the application to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and recommencement of the Village's review period.
            (4)   The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the revised application.
            (5)   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the

However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless
facility associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the
small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
      2.   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
   H.   Height Limitations:
      1.   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.

other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
   I.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for a
new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the
small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply
for a special use permit, variance or administrative waiver, in conformance
with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in Village ordinances.
   J.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable

replacement of utility poles.
   M.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the Village and the wireless provider agree to extend
this period or a delay is caused by makeready work for a municipal utility pole
or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site,
provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred
sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be
void unless the Village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   N.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an

means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial improvement, "actual
start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor
or other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: See definition of Building.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage subsequent to the effective date hereof (or
during the life of the building, for the next 10 years) equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must
be included in this determination. The term includes "repetitive loss"
buildings, as defined in this section.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
   A.   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a
structure taking place subsequent to the effective date hereof (or during the
life of the building, for the next 10 years) in which the cumulative percentage
of improvements:
      1.   Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started; or
      2.   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
   B.   "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive
loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
   C.   The term does not include:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
required federal, state, and/or local permits and elevation certification is
presumed to be in violation until such time as the documentation is provided.

9-5-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is the base flood. The best available base
flood data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available
data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace
the existing data with better data and submit it to FEMA and IDNR/OWR for
approval prior to any development of the site.
   A.   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of the Sangamon River and
Fancy Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the
countywide "flood insurance study of Sangamon County, Illinois" prepared by the
federal emergency management agency, effective August 2, 2007.
   B.   The base flood elevation for each floodplain delineated as an AH zone
or AO zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the countywide
"flood insurance rate map of Sangamon County, Illinois".
   C.   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining floodplains
delineated as an A zone on the countywide "Flood Insurance Rate Map Of Sangamon
County, Illinois" shall be according to the best data available from federal,

jurisdiction of the village of Sherman or that may be annexed into the village
of Sherman shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the "Flood
Insurance Study Of Sangamon County, Illinois", prepared by the federal
emergency management agency and dated effective August 2, 2007. (Ord. 2007-6,
6-19-2007)
9-5-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
   A.   Permit Required; Compliance With Provisions: No person, firm,
corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any
development in the floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from
the zoning enforcement officer and village clerk. The zoning enforcement
officer and village clerk shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-
2007; amd. 2010 Code)

   C.   Review Of Information: Upon receipt of an application for a development
permit, the zoning enforcement officer and village clerk shall compare the
elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any development located on
land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood
elevation and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first
flood insurance rate map is not in the floodplain and, therefore, not subject
to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development located on
land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected,
but not shown on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to the
provisions of this chapter. The zoning enforcement officer and village clerk
shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the
development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to
the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
   D.   Additional Documents: The zoning enforcement officer and village clerk
shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other
federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit not required letters
that may be required for this type of activity. The zoning enforcement officer
and village clerk shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and
local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007; amd. 2010 Code)

or relocation of a watercourse. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007)
9-5-11: VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority: Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship
on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village
zoning board of appeals for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall
review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its
recommendation to the village board of trustees. The village board of trustees
may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance as it deems necessary
to further the intent of this chapter.
   B.   Standards For Variance Request: No variance shall be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;

      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   C.   Variances From Specific Provisions:
      1.   The zoning board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protection standards of
section
9-5-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
         a.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
twenty five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance
coverage;
         b.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
         c.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
      2.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
9-5-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or "historic structure", as defined
section
9-5-2 of this chapter, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
9-5-6 and
9-5-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         a.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         b.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007)
9-5-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully hereunder. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007)
9-5-13: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
   A.   Violation: Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain
or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be
deemed to be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007)
   B.   Determination Of Violation; Notice: Upon due investigation, the zoning
enforcement officer and village clerk may determine that a violation of the
minimum standards of this chapter exists. The zoning enforcement officer and
village clerk shall notify the owner in writing of such violation. (Ord. 2007-
6, 6-19-2007; amd. 2010 Code)
   C.   Injunction And Penalty: If such owner fails, after ten (10) days'
notice, to correct the violation:
      1.   The village shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance herewith;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007)
   D.   Insurance Increased: The zoning enforcement officer and village clerk
shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a wilful act to
increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood
insurance policy to be suspended.
   E.   Suspension Of Development; Stop Work Order; Hearing:
      1.   The zoning enforcement officer and village clerk are authorized to
issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop
work order shall be in writing, shall indicate the reason for the issuance, and
shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring
the stop work order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the
permit. (Ord. 2007-6, 6-19-2007; amd. 2010 Code)
      2.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked
until a hearing is held by the village zoning board of appeals. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state the grounds
for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation and the time and place
of the hearing.
      3.   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the village
zoning board of appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended
or revoked.
   F.   Other Remedies; Costs: Nothing herein shall prevent the village from
taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.
2007-6, 6-19-2007)
9-5-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village to
fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program. However, this
chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve
eligibility in the program; nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and
other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2007-6,
6-19-2007)
CHAPTER 6
BUILDING FACADES
SECTION:
9-6-1: Nonresidential Facade Standards
9-6-1: NONRESIDENTIAL FACADE STANDARDS:
   A.   These standards are intended to provide a framework for future
commercial developments. This framework requires a basic level of architectural
variety, compatibility of scale with surrounding uses, pedestrian and bicycle
access, and recognition of the historical context of the village of Sherman.
These standards are not to be interpreted as limiting architectural or planning
creativity, but are intended to promote commercial development that is both
aesthetically and commercially successful.
      1.   Architectural Review Commission: As part of the building permit
review process, all applicants for permits for commercial development shall
submit samples of building materials (brick, stone, roofing, etc.), color
selections, and color renderings along with the building plans to the
architectural review commission for approval.
The village president, village architect and village administrator shall serve
on the architectural review commission.
      2.   Large Commercial Uses: In order to promote a desirable land plan for
a large commercial site, the applicant should be aware how the structures shall
be viewed from the access roads leading to the proposed development and have
addressed the following:
         a.   Access road traffic shall be clear and unencumbered by parking
stalls. Such access shall provide for all necessary traffic lanes.
         b.   Access points shall be minimized.
         c.   The perimeter of the property shall provide for a thirty foot
(30') minimum landscape strip.
         d.   The perimeter of the site adjacent to a street shall provide for
commercial outlots, if possible.
         e.   Parking for all outlots shall be placed away from the access
roads.
         f.   Parking for all outlots shall be screened from the adjoining
street system by the building and shall be provided on the exterior ring road
or between buildings, but not on access road frontage.
         g.   All entrances to the development shall be allowed to provide for
a large monument sign. (1 per entrance and sign can be up to 20 square feet in
size, per village ordinance.)
      3.   Street Orientation:
         a.   Facades shall be articulated to reduce long unbroken lines and
provide interest. Facades greater than one hundred feet (100') in length should
incorporate wall plan projections or recesses.
         b.   Ground floor facades that front on public streets shall have
arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or similar features.
         c.   Buildings shall incorporate architectural features and patterns
that provide visual interest, at the scale of the pedestrian.
         d.   The elements noted herein shall be an integral part of the
building rather than superficially applied trim, graphics, or paint.
         e.   Building facades must include a repeating pattern that shall
include no less than two (2) of the elements noted in these standards. At least
one of the elements shall repeat horizontally. These elements shall include:
            (1)   Color change.
            (2)   Texture change.

are not allowed.
            (3)   Unarticulated, flat front, all glass, or metal, futuristic
style buildings are not allowed.
            (4)   All buildings are to be designed with common architectural
elements, including: open glass storefronts; clearly defined entrances to
ground and upper floors; sign bands and awnings incorporated into the design
and scale of the building; upper floor windows placed in proportion to building
width and height; and cornices and parapets.
            (5)   Adjacent buildings shall have component parts in good
proportion with one another. Similar design linkages shall include placing
window lines, belt courses, and other horizontal elements in a pattern that is
harmonious and reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings.
            (6)   Large structures shall be designed to reduce perceived height
and bulk by dividing the building mass into small scale components (i.e.,
height of a wall, cornice, or parapet line should match that of adjacent
buildings).
            (7)   Buildings with ground level retail and office space shall
include open, clear glass windows to allow views into building interiors and to
reinforce a positive, active shopping environment.
            (8)   Reflective glass is not allowed.
            (9)   Architectural design must articulate and enhance buildings,
especially those located at street corners due to their prominence and
visibility. Where appropriate, features such as cupolas, atriums, clock towers,
and/or varying rooflines should be incorporated to add visual interest to the
street.
            (10)   Monotony of design in multiple building projects by
repetition of units is not allowed. Variation of detail, form and siting shall
be employed to provide interest. Buildings of the same design or exterior
elevation are not allowed on adjacent lots.

improved with steam cleaning, power washing, tuckpointing, accent painting, and
limited graphics.
            (16)   All graphics on blank, exposed side and rear walls shall be
limited to ten percent (10%) or two hundred (200) square feet, whichever is
less, of the blank exposed wall area.
            (17)   New buildings shall incorporate interesting architectural
details or features to provide layers of interest and variety.
            (18)   Eccentric and protruding facade designs that do not relate
to the street or limit future tenant changes are prohibited.
      5.   Building Materials:
         a.   High quality, durable materials, which do not require frequent
maintenance (brick, stone, and glass) shall be used for all facades, as well

corrected within the given period of time, the property owner shall be subject
to a fine as set forth in title 1, chapter 4 of this code. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-
2011)
9-7-6: CALCULATIONS:
   A.   Calculation Of Minimum Requirements: The amount of all required
landscaping shall be calculated by utilizing the point system described herein.
If the applicant decides to create a landscape design by a different means than
the point system, they may do so through the alternative compliance provisions
described below. The landscaping requirements of this chapter shall be based on
formulas found herein. The requirements for a given yard or parking lot shall
be the total of all equations listed under the applicable section. In
calculating any requirement in this section, should a fraction result of one-
half (0.5) or greater, it shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
      1.   Point Allocations: The following point allocations shall apply for
all required landscaping:
Classification Base Value
Classification                                     Base Value

 Deciduous shrubs                                 2 points
Ground cover:                                       
 Flowering perennials or annuals                  8 points per 100 sq. ft.
 Green perennials or annuals                      4 points per 100 sq. ft.
 
      2.   Incentives For Preserving Existing Landscaping: Existing landscaping
that is in a vigorous growing condition and is not specifically prohibited by
this chapter may count toward meeting the point requirements of this chapter.
Furthermore, the following plant materials will be awarded five (5) additional
points (added to base value) per tree when preserved:
 
Shade (tall or canopy) trees                    12+ inches diameter trunk
Intermediate (small, medium or ornamental) tree 15 feet high or taller
Evergreen tree                                  15 feet high or taller
 
Additional points may be credited to the owner of "monumental, historic,
champion or rare" trees. The specific point value shall be determined by the
city arborist, at the recommendation of the tree commission.
      3.   Incentive For Planting Larger Landscaping: Planting of landscaping
larger than the minimum required sizes will be rewarded with five (5)
additional points (added to base value) per tree when the proposed sizes are as
follows:
 
Shade (tall or canopy) trees               4 inches diameter (5 inches in TBYs)
Intermediate (small, medium or ornamental) 10 feet high or taller
trees
 
      4.   Incentive For Planting Native Plant Materials And/Or Recommended
Trees: Use of plant materials identified as "native" to the area by the
Illinois department of natural resources natural history survey and/or trees
listed in the top ten tree list recommended by the tree commission and/or the
state tree (white oak) will be rewarded with five (5) additional points (added
to base value) per tree, three (3) additional points per shrub, and one point
per ground cover or perennial plant.
      5.   Alternative Plan: Petitioners may choose to follow the point system
described above or to submit a landscape plan to the village president under
the alternative compliance provisions of this section. The alternative
compliance provisions are intended to give the petitioner the flexibility
needed to respond to unique site issues and still meet the intent of this
chapter.
      6.   Compliance: Landscape plans submitted through the alternative
compliance process shall fully achieve the performance standards and landscape
plan requirements as described in sections
9-7-3 and
9-7-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)
9-7-7: FRONT YARD, CORNER SIDE YARD AND THROUGH LOT LANDSCAPING:
   A.   All developed zoning lots other than those zoning lots that are located
within a single-family zoning district or zoning lots developed as single-
family or duplex, shall provide front and corner side yard landscaping as
provided for in this section. (3 or more townhouses and condominiums shall not
be considered as single-family or duplexes.)
      1.   The number of points that must be achieved through landscaping for
front and corner side yards shall be based on the overall length of the lot
frontage as measured along the property line divided by two (2). For example,
if the front or corner side lot frontage of a property is two hundred twenty
feet (220') in length, then one hundred ten (110) points must be achieved
through landscaping. One-half (1/2) of the points for front and corner side
yard landscaping must be achieved by utilizing plants from the tree
classification and one-half (1/2) must be from the shrub or ground cover
classification.
      2.   Front yard, corner side yard and through lot frontage landscaping
shall be planted in the required front yard, corner side yard and through lot
yard. If there is additional area between the required front or corner side
yard and the closest on site parking lot or building all or some of the
required landscaping may be planted within such area subject to approval by the
village president. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)
9-7-8: PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
   A.   The number of points that must be achieved for parking lots through
landscaping shall be equal to the total number of parking spaces provided. The
points may be achieved through the use of any combination of trees, ground
cover and/or shrubs.
      1.   Less Than One Hundred Spaces: When a parking lot has less than one
hundred (100) parking spaces the landscaping may be placed within interior
curbed parking islands and/or within ten feet (10') of the perimeter of the
parking lot.
      2.   Greater Than One Hundred Spaces: When a parking lot has one hundred
(100) or more parking spaces, one-half (1/2) of the required points shall
consist of canopy (medium-tall) trees planted in curb islands within the
interior of the parking lot. The intent of this provision is to break up large
expanses of pavement and to provide shading by locating canopy (medium-tall)
trees away from the perimeter and within the interior of parking lots.
      3.   Parking Lot Islands: Parking lot islands shall be curbed with
concrete, asphalt or a functionally equivalent material that must be approved
by the village president. The following materials are not considered
functionally equivalent to concrete curbs and are therefore unacceptable for
use as curbs:
         a.   Landscape timbers.
         b.   Railroad ties.
         c.   Wood/lumber.
         d.   Concrete wheel stops.
      4.   Minimum Area: The minimum area for planting all types of trees
within parking lots shall not be less than one hundred fifty three (153) square
feet. Shade trees and intermediate trees shall not be planted in any area with
a width of less than five feet (5'). Evergreen trees shall not be planted in an
area with a width of less than ten feet (10'). Shrubs and ground cover shall
not be planted in areas with a width of less than two feet (2'). When plants
are proposed to be planted within curbed islands or adjacent to curbs, the
width of such planting areas shall be measured from inside of curbs. The
locations of the parking lot landscaping will be subject to review by the
village president.
      5.   Visibility: No landscaping or walls that exceed twenty four inches
(24") in height shall be located within ten feet (10') of any parking lot
access drive or otherwise located so as to interfere with the sight distance
visibility of vehicular traffic or pedestrians.
      6.   Walls And Fences: Walls and fences shall be wrought iron, or
simulated wrought iron, wood, stucco or architectural quality brick, stone or
textured and pigmented concrete that is compatible within the adjoining
building design and architectural integrity of the area.
      7.   Vehicle Overhang: Vehicles may not overhang the minimum required
landscape area. However, planting areas adjacent to parking may be increased by
a minimum of two feet (2'), exclusive of the curbing, to allow vehicles to
overhang. The adjacent parking space overhanging the planting area may be
reduced in size by the same amount, and the parking space overhanging the
planting area shall not be required to provide wheel stops in addition to the
curbing. Any plant material in the planting area shall be located outside the
overhang area and out of the way from danger from vehicles, or shall be ground
cover material, no greater than twelve inches (12") in height at maturity.
      8.   Other Applicable Regulations: All other applicable regulations for
parking lots apply. The Illinois accessibility code will be enforced for all
parking lots. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)
9-7-9: LANDSCAPING FOR BUSINESS LOTS ADJOINING A RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT:
   A.   Office, commercial and industrial zoning lots which abut, or, in the
absence of an alley, would abut any residential zoning lot or district shall be
required to provide a transitional buffer yard (TBY) unless otherwise provided
for in this chapter. Multi- family zoning lots which abut, or in the absence of
an alley, would abut any single-family, or duplex zoning lot or district, are
also required to provide a TBY.
      1.   Depth: Depth of yard shall meet size as required by title 10 of this
code.
      2.   Prohibited Materials In TBY: Any TBY required pursuant to this
chapter shall be maintained as a planted or landscaped area only. No driveways,
refuse containers, storage, aisleways, vehicular maneuvering area, mechanical
equipment, sidewalks materials other than landscaping, or structures of any
form shall be located within any required TBY. However, if any emergency exit
into the TBY area is required by a code, a concrete pad of no more than twenty
three (23) square feet may be placed at grade level immediately outside of the
required exit.
      3.   Utility Structures: Utility structures may be permitted in a TBY on
a case by case basis and only through the alternative compliance provisions of
this chapter.
      4.   Plant Material: Plant material for TBY shall meet the following:
         a.   The number of points that must be achieved through landscaping in
a TBY shall be based on the overall length of the TBY as measured along the TBY
property line. For example, if the property line running the length of the TBY
is one hundred eighty feet (180') long, then one hundred eighty (180) points
must be achieved through landscaping.
         b.   One-half (1/2) of the points for TBY landscaping must be achieved
by utilizing plants from the tree classification and one-half (1/2) must be
from the shrub or ground cover classification.
         c.   One-half (1/2) of the total points for TBY landscaping must also
be evergreen or broadleaf evergreen plantings.
         d.   All shade trees in a TBY must be one and three-fourths inches
(13/4") caliper size or larger. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)
9-7-10: SCREENING OF ACTIVITY AREAS:
   A.   On site activity areas as described below that are adjacent to a
required TBY are required to be visually screened with a fence, wall, berm,
evergreen planting or combination thereof which achieves a substantially solid
six foot (6') visual barrier. If a fence or wall is used to meet this
requirement, it must be located between the activity area and the TBY.
Topography and adjacent uses shall be taken into account to determine the most
effective means of screening. This visual barrier shall be required when all or
any portion of the subject site that is adjacent to the required TBY is planned
or used for the following activities:
Loading or unloading of goods;
Parking, temporary or permanent of vehicles;
Production, assembly, processing, or demolition of goods;
Refuse container/dumpster loading, unloading, or storage;
Storage of materials or merchandise.
      1.   These requirements shall be in addition to all other landscaping
requirements of any type.
      2.   When plantings are utilized to meet this requirement, they must be
capable of achieving a substantially solid visual barrier within two (2) years
from the date of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   B.   Other than in the downtown district, all refuse disposal areas shall be
screened from public view by a solid, commercial grade wood fence, wall, or
equivalent material or compact evergreen plantings with a minimum height of six
feet (6') and not greater than eight feet (8').
   C.   Any scrap, junk, salvage, reclamation or similar yard, or any auto
salvage yard shall provide a solid fence or wall on all lot lines with only
such openings as are necessary for ingress or egress. Said fence or wall shall
be maintained in a neat and orderly appearance and shall be of such height that
any materials stored within the confines of the fence cannot be seen above a
line of sight established between a point four and one-half feet (41/2') above
the centerline of the street nearest to that fence, and the top of said fence.
(Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)
9-7-11: SITE AND PARKING AREA LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Lighting: Lights shall be installed in all parking areas containing
five (5) or more parking spaces and shall be illuminated between dusk and dawn
whenever said premises are open for operation. Open for operation shall be any
time that a retail business is open for the sale of goods or services or a
retail or office actually has employees working within or upon said premises,
other than guards, watchmen, or home occupation. For all parking areas with
more than twenty (20) parking spaces, the illumination may be provided through
the use of pole mounted light fixtures. Building mounted fixtures shall be
primarily for aesthetic and security purposes and shall comply with general
standards as noted below.
   B.   Definitions:
    FULL CUTOFF TYPE FIXTURE: A luminaire or light fixture that by the design
of the housing, does not allow any light dispersion or direct glare to shine
above a ninety degree (90°), horizontal plane from the base of the fixture.
Full cutoff fixtures must be installed in a horizontal position as designed, or
the purpose of the design is defeated, and disability glare will result.
   LIGHT TRESPASS: Light from an artificial light source that is intruding into
or spills over to adjoining sites, streets, public and private property.
   STRAY LIGHT: Produced within the eye by luminance source (usually light
source) within the field of view.
   UPLIGHTING: Any light source that distributes illumination above a ninety
degree (90°) horizontal plane.
   C.   General Standards:
      1.   Site lighting shall include all lighting on property, other than
lighting within a fully enclosed building.
      2.   Site lighting fixtures shall be compatible with the building design
and the adjoining landscape and shall not be used in such a manner as to turn
the building itself into "signage".
      3.   Parking lot poles/fixtures of the same style, height, color and
intensity of lighting shall be used throughout the development area. Varying
styles of fixtures may be permitted if it is demonstrated that the styles
contribute to an overall theme for the area.
      4.   Site lighting shall not result in light trespass by spilling over to
adjacent sites or properties.
      5.   Site lighting shall not result in disability glare that is directed
toward or reflected onto adjoining properties.
      6.   Site lighting shall not result in disability glare that is directed
toward or reflected onto streets, or interior drives where such glare could
negatively impact vehicular or pedestrian safety.
      7.   Except when displaying the flags of the United States Of America,
state of Illinois or village of Sherman or as may be provided elsewhere in this
section, site lighting shall at no time be directed upward (uplighting), in a
radiating pattern and/or moving or sweeping pattern, or at any angle which will
light surfaces other than building walls, parking or pedestrian areas, and
landscaped area, and shall not create lighting patterns which will direct light
toward residential areas.
      8.   All site lighting shall be installed utilizing underground cable.
      9.   Except where otherwise provided, fixture heads shall be of full
cutoff type which controls the lighting pattern and shields abutting property
from direct view of the light source.
      10.   Site lighting, other than security lighting, shall be turned off
when a facility is closed, vacant or otherwise occupied solely by security
employees.
      11.   Outdoor display lots for vehicles and similar sales facilities

closing so the remaining illumination level is sufficient for security purposes
only; however, that any illumination used after eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M.
shall be reduced to levels sufficient for security purposes only.
   D.   Plan Submission Requirements: Detailed drawings of all exterior light
fixtures including the angle at which they are mounted, in relationship to
grade and a site plan showing their location shall be submitted with each
building permit application, of which the light fixtures are a part of.
A photometric pattern, showing the foot-candle value at all property lines
shall be submitted within ninety (90) days following the application of each
building permit, if the scope of work includes the installation of exterior
lighting. (Ord. 2011-8A, 5-17-2011)

registration and inspection fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) does not
apply to additions to or alterations of existing structures. In no case shall
the minimum fee for a building permit be less than seventy five dollars
($75.00). In calculating the area subject to the permit fee, any attached
garage area shall be excluded. Any unattached garage or storage area
constructed at the time of obtaining the original permit shall not be included
in the calculation for determining the cost of a permit. Any attached garage,
unattached garage or storage area constructed after obtaining the original
permit shall be governed by subsections B2 and B3 of this section. (Ord. 1998-
13, 7-21-1998; amd. Ord. 2009-26, 8-18-2009; 2010 Code)
      2.   Whenever any porch, deck, fence, exterior stairway, unattached
storage shed of less than five hundred (500) square feet, swimming pool or
other improvement not already covered by subsection B1 of this section is
constructed within any front, rear or side yard, a building permit must be
obtained by the owner and an inspection conducted. The cost of such permit
under this subsection B2 shall be fifty dollars ($50.00).
      3.   The permit charge for a barn, warehouse or storage facility of over
five hundred (500) square feet shall be seventy five dollars ($75.00). If any
portion of a barn, warehouse or storage facility is used for office, business
or residential purposes, the provisions of subsection B1 of this section shall
apply. (Ord. 1998-13, 7-21-1998; amd. 2010 Code)
      4.   No fee will be charged in the case of a tax exempt organization
requesting a building permit for real estate which is also tax exempt;
provided, however, that the application for said building permit must be
prepared and filed in accordance with the requirements of the ordinances of the
village in all other respects. (Ord. 1998-13, 7-21-1998)
      5.   In the event construction of any structure is commenced prior to
application being made to the zoning enforcement officer for a building permit,
the fee for the building permit shall be doubled. (1984 Code § 5-11-2)
   C.   Large Scale Developments: There shall be a one hundred dollar ($100.00)
filing fee for large scale developments. (2010 Code)

furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the
action is taken certifies to the board of appeals, after the notice of appeal
has been filed with him, that, by reason of facts stated in the written appeal,
a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In this
event, the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining
order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on
the application and on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and
due cause shown. (1984 Code § 5-10-5; amd. 2010 Code)

   D.   Decisions: All decisions, after the zoning board of appeals' hearing on
appeals from an administrative order, requirement, decision or determination of
the zoning enforcement officer or other authorized officials of the village
board, shall, in all instances, be final administrative determinations and
shall be subject to judicial review only in accordance with applicable statutes

orders, requirements, decisions, and determinations as are necessary to enforce
this title.

reconstructed, enlarged, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any
building, structure or land is used in violation of this title within the
corporate limits of the village, the proper authorities of the village, in
addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate legal action or
proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, alteration, repair, conversion,
maintenance or use to restrain, correct or abate such variation, to prevent the
occupancy of such building, structure or land or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about such premises so located within the
corporate limits. (1984 Code § 5-11-1)
   C.   The zoning enforcement officer, village official or persons under their
supervision shall conduct investigations to determine compliance or
noncompliance with the provisions of this title. In the performance of such
investigation, the zoning enforcement officer, village official or authorized
representatives may enter into and upon and cause any land or structure to be
inspected and examined at all reasonable times of the day or night. Inspections
shall be conducted after notifying the owners of the property; except, that
when the owner is not available, the zoning enforcement officer, village
official or their representatives may inspect the land and the exterior of any
structures. (1984 Code § 5-11-1; amd. 2010 Code)

10-3B-4: Processing
10-3B-5: Hearing
10-3B-6: Standards
10-3B-7: Conditions
10-3B-8: Denial By Board Of Appeals; Approval By Village Board
10-3B-1: CLASSIFICATION:
The execution of this title is based upon the division of the affected area of
the village into zoning districts within any one of which the use of land and
buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as related to
the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
special uses of the land which, because of their unique character, cannot be
properly classified in any particular zoning district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring
lands, and upon the public need for the particular use or the particular
location. These special uses, termed "conditional permitted uses" in this
title, fall into two (2) categories:
   A.   Uses operated by a public agency or public regulated utilities, or uses
traditionally affected with a public interest.
   B.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities. (1984 Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-2: AUTHORIZATION:
Conditional permitted uses shall be authorized by the village board; provided,
that no application for a conditional permitted use shall be acted upon by the
board until after the public hearing has been held by the zoning board of
appeals, after due notice by publication as required herein, and its report of
findings and recommendations has been transmitted to the village board. (1984
Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-3: INITIATION:
A petition for a conditional permitted use may be filed by any interested
property owner or contract purchaser. In cases where a contract purchaser is
the petitioner, the contract purchaser shall provide a letter from the owner
which states that the owner is aware of the petition and the request(s)
contained therein, that the petitioner is indeed a contract purchaser, and that
the owner approves the action. Such petition for a variation shall be filed in
writing and shall contain information as the zoning board of appeals may
require by rule. (1984 Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-4: PROCESSING:
A petition for a conditional permitted use shall be filed with the zoning
enforcement officer. The zoning enforcement officer shall forward such petition
to the zoning board of appeals within ten (10) days. The petition shall include
a list of adjacent property owners, including owners across the street and
across the alley as well as their mailing address(es). A map shall also be
submitted which shows the boundaries of the property, the location of existing
and/or proposed structures in relation to property lines and adjacent land
uses. (1984 Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-5: HEARING:
No conditional permitted use shall be granted by the village board except after
a public hearing before the zoning board of appeals of which there shall be a
notice of the time and place of the hearing published at least once, not more
than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in
one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the village. (1984
Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-6: STANDARDS:
No conditional permitted uses shall be granted by the village board unless the
conditional permitted use:
   A.   Is so proposed that the proposed location, design and method of
operation of such use will minimize the adjacent effects on the character of
the surrounding area.
   B.   Is so proposed to be operated, designed and located so that the public
health, safety, and welfare will be protected.
   C.   Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the
vicinity in which it is located. (1984 Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-7: CONDITIONS:
The zoning board of appeals may recommend and the village board may provide
such restrictions upon the location, construction, and operation of a
conditional permitted use, including, but not limited to, provisions for off
street parking and loading, as may be deemed necessary to promote the general
objectives of this title and to minimize the injury to the value of property in
the vicinity. (1984 Code § 5-10-8)
10-3B-8: DENIAL BY BOARD OF APPEALS; APPROVAL BY VILLAGE BOARD:
Any proposed conditional permitted use which fails to receive the approval of
the zoning board of appeals shall not be approved by the village board except
by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all trustees then holding office. (2010 Code)

ZONING DISTRICTS AND MAP
SECTION:
10-5-1: Districts Established; Purposes
10-5-2: Zoning Districts Map
10-5-3: Determination Of District Boundaries
10-5-1: DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED; PURPOSES:
In order to carry out the purpose and provisions of this title, the following
districts are hereby established:
   A.   AG Agricultural District: The purpose of the agricultural district is
to encourage the preservation of proper setting for and pleasant approaches to
the village; to provide an area for certain types of agricultural pursuits
protected from infringements of unguided urban development; to create and
preserve a setting for rural small estate residential development; to conserve
areas physically unsuitable for intensive development; and to provide in the
area immediately surrounding the village, an environment capable of
accommodating future expansion of the village in an orderly and efficient
manner.
   B.   R Residential Districts: The purpose of the residential districts is to
provide an area for residential uses and those public and semipublic uses
considered an integral part of the community they serve.
      1.   R-1 Residential, Single-Family, Low Density: The R-1 residential
district provides for single-family dwellings, large lot development for
families wishing a lower density and more open space in the neighborhood and
accompanying community facilities.
      2.   R-2 Residential, Single-Family And Two-Family, Medium Density: The
R-2 residential district provides for single-family and two- family dwellings
so that medium density may be achieved. This classification allows for a high
quality residential development while conserving and reducing the need for
street pavements, utility lines and allowing more efficient police, fire and
other community services.
      3.   R-3 Residential, General Residence, Single-Family, Two-Family, And
Multiple-Family, High Density: The R-3 residential district provides for
multiple-family dwellings so that a high density of development may be achieved
and a greater variety of building structural types may be erected. The
increased density is intended to provide for the advantages of a wider choice
of housing type, housing expense, and for the opportunity to be free from the
maintenance demands associated with lower density housing.
      4.   R-4 Residential, Single-Family Mobile Home, Medium Density: The R-
4 residential district provides space for mobile home parks.
   C.   Business Districts: The purpose of the business districts is to provide
an area for commercial uses and those public and semipublic uses normally
considered an integral part of a self- sufficient community.
      1.   B-1 Business District: The B-1 business district provides for
communitywide retail shopping and personal services. It is intended to
establish and preserve optimum conditions and access for high traffic retail
intensive establishments and commercial shopping centers.
      2.   B-2 General Business District: The B-2 business district provides
for the business sales and services needed by the general population and
businesses. It is intended to establish and preserve conditions conducive to
efficient transfer of goods and services from business to business, and to
provide for uses not accommodated in the B-1 district.
   D.   Industrial Districts: The purpose of the industrial districts is to
provide an area for those uses considered incompatible with day to day
commerce.
      1.   I-1 Restricted Performance Manufacturing District: The I-1 district
provides for a range of manufacturing uses which can meet stringent performance
standards. (See chapter 11 of this title.)
      2.   I-2 General Performance Manufacturing District: The I-2 district
provides for a range of manufacturing uses which can meet less stringent
performance standards. (See chapter 11 of this title.) (1984 Code §
5-2-1)
10-5-2: ZONING DISTRICTS MAP:
The location and boundaries of districts established by this title shall be
shown on the zoning districts map dated                    which is hereby
incorporated as part of this title. (1984 Code §
5-2-2)
10-5-3: DETERMINATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES:
Boundaries are as shown on the zoning districts map, as amended from time to
time. When uncertainty exists with regard to the boundaries of districts as
shown on the zoning districts map, the following rules shall apply:
   A.   District boundary lines are either the centerlines of railroads,
highways, streets, alleys, easements, or streams; or are lot lines and tract
lines, or such lines extended, unless otherwise indicated.
   B.   Wherever a district is indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling
a railroad, highway, or street, the depth of such strips shall be in accordance
with the dimensions shown on the map measured at right angles from the
centerline of a railroad, street or highway, and the length of frontage shall
be in accordance with the dimensions shown on the map from the centerlines of
railroad, highway or street rights of way unless otherwise indicated. (1984

SECTION:
10-8-1: Nonconforming Uses
10-8-2: Noncomplying Buildings
10-8-1: NONCONFORMING USES:
   A.   Continuation Of Nonconforming Use:
      1.   Any use of a building or land lawfully existing on the effective
date hereof, but which does not conform with the use regulations of the
district in which the building or land is situated, may be continued under the
regulations of this chapter, but this chapter shall not be interpreted as
authorizing the continuation of any use of a building or land which was not
lawfully existing on the effective date hereof as to such building or land.
      2.   Any use of a building or land which conformed with the use
regulations of the district in which the building or land was classified under
the village zoning ordinance immediately prior to the adoption of this title,
or which qualified as a nonconforming use under the village zoning ordinance at
that time, is a lawful nonconforming use which may continue as a nonconforming
use under the provisions of this chapter.
      3.   If a building or land becomes subject to this title, whether by the
extension of the zoning jurisdiction by reason of extension of the corporate
limits or otherwise, and the use of the building or land at the time it becomes
subject to this title is lawful but does not conform with the use regulations
of the district in which the building or land is situated, such use is a lawful
use which may continue as a nonconforming use under this chapter.
      4.   If a conforming use of a building or land becomes nonconforming by
virtue of an amendment of this title, then such use shall be considered to be a
lawful use which may continue as a nonconforming use under this chapter.
      5.   No use of a building or land which neither conforms with the use
regulations of the district in which the building or land is situated nor
qualifies as an authorized nonconforming use under the provisions of this
subsection shall be considered a lawful use or be permitted to continue under
the provisions of this title.
      6.   No use of a building which conforms with the use regulations of the
district in which the building is situated shall be considered to be
nonconforming merely because the building occupied by the use does not comply
with the height regulations of the district in which the building is situated
or because the building is so located on the zoning lot that it does not comply
with the yard regulations of such district.
      7.   The regulations of this chapter pertaining to a building occupied by
a nonconforming use shall apply not only to a building which is completely
occupied by such a use, but shall also apply to one in which the nonconforming
use occupies only a portion of the building. (1984 Code § 5-5-1)
   B.   Change Of Nonconforming Use: A nonconforming use may be allowed to
change to another nonconforming use by the village board only following a
public hearing before the zoning board as provided for in subsections D2 and D3
of this section. (1984 Code § 5-5-2)
   C.   Enlargement Or Extension: A nonconforming use in a residence district
may not be enlarged or extended. In other districts, a nonconforming use may be

by the fee provided in section
10-3-7 of this title. (1984 Code § 5-5-4)
      2.   Requirements For Approval Of Change Of Nonconforming Use: The zoning
board may recommend that the village board permit a nonconforming use to be
changed to another nonconforming use if the board finds:
         a.   That the substitution or addition will not be detrimental to or
tend to alter the character of the neighborhood.
         b.   That the substitution or addition will not increase congestion to
the streets.
         c.   That the new use is no less restricted than the existing use.
(1984 Code § 5-5-5)
      3.   Requirements For Approval Of Enlargement Or Extension Of
Nonconforming Use: Except in a residential district, the zoning board may
recommend that the village board permit the enlargement or extension of a
nonconforming use if the zoning board finds that:
         a.   The enlargement or extension does not cause the area to be
occupied by a nonconforming use to exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of
the area occupied by a nonconforming use on the effective date hereof.
         b.   That the enlargement or extension does not exceed the applicable
bulk regulations for the district.
         c.   The applicable off street parking requirements are complied with
for the enlarged portion of the use.
         d.   The enlargement or extension will not be detrimental to or tend
to alter the character of the neighborhood. (1984 Code § 5-5-6)
   E.   Discontinuance Of Use: If a nonconforming use discontinues active or
continuous operations for a period of one year, the building or land where such
nonconforming use existed shall thereafter be occupied and used only for a
conforming use. (1984 Code § 5-5-7)
   F.   Damage Or Destruction: If a building containing a nonconforming use is
by any means destroyed or damaged to the extent of more than sixty percent
(60%) of its value, such building or reconstruction thereof shall thereinafter
be occupied and used only for a conforming use. (1984 Code § 5-5-8)
   G.   Repairs Or Alterations:
      1.   Normal Maintenance: Normal maintenance of a building or other
structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
nonstructural repairs or incidental alterations.
      2.   Structural Alterations:
         a.   No structural alterations shall be made in a building or other
structure containing a nonconforming use, except:
            (1)   When required by law or by regulatory authority pursuant to
law.
            (2)   When made pursuant to an enlargement or extension permitted
by subsection C, D1 or D3 of this section.
            (3)   When made to accommodate a conforming use.
         b.   However, in any district, a building containing residential
nonconforming uses may be altered in any way to improve interior livability;
provided, that no structural alterations shall be made which would increase the
number of dwelling units or would create an enlargement or extension of the
building, unless as permitted above. (1984 Code § 5-5-9)
10-8-2: NONCOMPLYING BUILDINGS:
   A.   Continuation Of Use: The use of a noncomplying building or other
structure may be continued, except as otherwise provided in this section. (1984
Code § 5-5-10)
   B.   Damage Or Destruction: If a noncomplying building or other structure is
destroyed or damaged by any means, it may be reconstructed as it existed
previous to said destruction or damage; provided, that such reconstruction
neither creates a new noncompliance of any portion of the building or structure
as it previously existed. (1984 Code § 5-5-11)
   C.   Enlargements: A noncomplying building or other structure may be
enlarged; provided, that no enlargement is permitted which would either create
a new noncompliance or increase the degree of noncompliance of any portion of
the building or structure. (1984 Code § 5-5-12)
   D.   Repairs Or Alterations: Normal maintenance, repairs, or structural
alterations are permitted in a noncomplying building or other structure;
except, that alterations creating enlargements shall be subject to the
provisions of subsection C of this section. (1984 Code § 5-5-13)

10-9-13: Loading And Unloading Spaces Required
10-9-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to help increase safety, lessen congestion, and
reduce storage of vehicles in the streets. (1984 Code § 5-6-1)
10-9-2: REQUIRED ZONING:
Required parking spaces and loading/unloading spaces shall be located in a
zoning district having the same zoning prefix, i.e., residential parking in R
districts; except, that industrial parking spaces may also be located in a B
district. (1984 Code § 5-6-2)
10-9-3: CALCULATION OF NUMBER OF SPACES:
   A.   In any determination of total parking requirements, any fraction less
than one-half (1/2) may be dropped and any fraction of one-half (1/2) or more
shall be counted as one parking space. When the number of employees is a factor
in determining the number required off street parking spaces, "employees" means
the maximum number of employees on duty at the same time.
   B.   When a building or structure is erected, the required spaces shall be
recorded. If there is an increase or decrease in number of dwelling units,
gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of
measurement specified in this chapter for determining the required parking or
loading facilities, and when such increase or decrease results in a requirement
for more or less total parking or loading spaces through application of this
chapter, the parking and loading spaces shall be increased or may be decreased
accordingly. (1984 Code § 5-6-5)
10-9-4: SIZE OF SPACES:
Each parking space shall be at least one hundred eighty (180) square feet in
area and shall be a definitely designated stall adequate for one motor vehicle
so that both doors may be opened. Adequate access to each stall and to the
street shall be provided. (1984 Code § 5-6-6)
10-9-5: PARKING LAYOUT DRAWING AND DESIGN:

provided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   B.   Each off street parking facility of more than four (4) spaces shall be
provided with an appropriate means of vehicular access to a street in a forward
manner only. Such off street parking spaces shall open directly upon an aisle
or driveway of such width and design as to afford adequate ingress and egress.
No driveway shall have a width exceeding thirty five feet (35'), or be nearer
than twenty feet (20') to an intersecting street right of way line. All such
driveways shall be constructed with a Portland cement concrete approach slab
extending from the edge of the roadway to the right of way line. The slab shall
provide for curbing and ramping of sidewalks, where applicable. The design
shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the engineer for the
village. (1984 Code § 5-6-7)
10-9-6: STORMWATER DRAINAGE; SURFACING:
   A.   All open off street parking areas containing more than four (4) parking
spaces shall be improved with an adequate stormwater drainage system, and paved
with a crushed stone base, or equal, not less than six inches (6") thick, and
wearing surface of asphaltic concrete or comparable hard surfaced, all weather
dustless material not less than two inches (2") thick, or Portland cement not
less than six inches (6") thick on a compacted subgrade. All open off street
parking areas containing not more than four (4) parking spaces shall be
surfaced and maintained in such a manner as to make them dust free. (1984 Code
§ 5-6-8)
   B.   All newly constructed or reconstructed residential driveways and off
street parking areas containing less than four (4) parking spaces in the
village shall have either a Portland cement concrete (PCC) or an asphalt cement
(AC) surface from the edge of the street to the entrance of the home garage or
accessory building served by said driveway. PCC pavement shall be a minimum of
four inches (4") thick on a compacted subgrade. AC pavement shall have a
minimum surface thickness of two inches (2") over a minimum of six inches (6")
of compacted crushed stone base or six inches (6") of full depth AC on a
compacted subgrade. The purpose of this subsection is to protect the edges of
the village streets and to minimize dust and standing water nuisances. (Ord.
1998-16, 11-17-1998)
10-9-7: LOCATION OF SPACES:
   A.   No parking space or loading space nor portion thereof established on
the same zoning lot with a building shall be located within a required front
yard.
   B.   No parking space nor portion thereof established on a zoning lot
without a building shall be located closer to any street line than the
established building line on adjacent properties nor closer than the front yard
setback required for the district in which the parking lot is located. (1984
Code § 5-6-12)
10-9-8: LIGHTING:
Any parking lot shall be arranged and maintained so that the lighting is
directed downward and does not shine directly upon any adjacent residence or
street and does not produce excessive glare. (1984 Code § 5-6-11)

All open off street automobile parking areas either created or redesigned and
rebuilt subsequent to the effective date hereof, containing two (2) or more
rows of parking stalls and an area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or
more, shall provide and maintain canopy type shade trees along with other forms
of vegetation hardy to the region in tree islands and planting strips. (1984
Code § 5-6-13)
10-9-10: USE RESTRICTIONS:
   A.   Off street parking facilities accessory to a residential use and
developed in any residential district in accordance with the requirements of
this title shall be used solely for the parking of noncommercial vehicles owned
by occupants of the dwelling structures to which such facilities are accessory
or by guests of the occupants. Under no circumstances shall required parking
facilities accessory to residential structures in all other residential zones
be used for the storage of commercial vehicles or for the parking of
automobiles belonging to the employees, tenants, visitors, or customers of
business or manufacturing establishments. Motor homes, trailers and campers may
be parked in enclosed garages and buildings or in rear yards 1 .
   B.   No motor vehicle repair work of any kind is permitted in any required
accessory off street parking facility. No gasoline or motor oil shall be sold
in conjunction with an accessory off street parking lot, except where such lot
is accessory to a business having such sale as a principal use.
   C.   No off street parking area or space shall be used for the purpose,
incidental or otherwise, of advertising or selling of cars unless the car is
owned by the resident or immediate family member and has a current license
plate. Cars which have a dealer's plate or do not have a title in the name of
an immediate family member are prohibited from being sold from such property.
(1984 Code § 5-6-10)
   D.   If groups of buildings contain uses which vary in their parking
requirements, the number of parking spaces shall be the sum of the individual
requirements for each use. Where peak parking requirements occur at different
times of the day or week as determined by the zoning enforcement officer, joint
facilities may be shared by two (2) or more uses. (1984 Code § 5-6-9; amd. 2010

10-10-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The sign regulations, controls and provisions set forth in this chapter
are made in accordance with an overall plan and program for the public safety,
area development, preservation of property values, and the general welfare of
the village, and are intended to aid in traffic control and traffic safety;
preserve and protect property values; lessen congestion of land and air space;
provide against undue concentrations of signs which distract and endanger
traffic safety and traffic flow; establish reasonable standards for commercial
and other advertising through the use of signs in order to maintain and
encourage business activity and area development; avoid uncontrolled
proliferation of signs; recognize the rights of the public in roads, streets,
and highways; preserve the wholesome and attractive character of the village;
and recognize that the general welfare includes a community plan that provides
for a community that shall be beautiful as well as healthful, spacious as well
as clean, and well balanced in its growth and development.
   B.   The sign regulations distinguish between on premises and off premises
business signs. This distinction is based on the finding that other media
(television, radio, newspapers, outdoor advertising sign structures) adequately
present avenues for business advertising. The restriction of off premises
business signs will significantly aid in the realization of the goals and
purposes recited in subsection A of this section.
   C.   The sign regulations expressly exclude from regulations nonbusiness
signs except insofar as necessary to prevent imminent danger to the health or
safety of the public.
   D.   These sign regulations expressly distinguish between outdoor
advertising sign structures and signs based on the specific finding that such
structures are capable of being utilized for and have been and continue to be
utilized for announcements of both a commercial and noncommercial nature, have
been a traditional and lawful use of land in the village, are a unique
communication medium involving nationally standardized signs, which are made
generally available to the public. At the same time, the regulations recognize
that a limitation upon the size and number and spacing of such structures is
consistent with and will further the goals expressed in this chapter. (1984

   A.   Generally: Any new uses established in any zoning district after the
effective date hereof shall be so operated as to comply with the performance
standards governing: 1) noise; 2) vibration; 3) smoke and particulate matter;
4) toxic and noxious matter; 5) odorous matter; 6) fire and explosive hazards;
and 7) glare and heat, as set forth hereinafter for the district in which such
use shall be located. No use already established on the effective date hereof
shall be so altered or modified as to conflict with, or further conflict with,
the applicable performance standards established hereinafter for the district
in which such use is located.
   B.   Industrial Districts: An application for a building permit in an I-
1 and I-2 district, when required by the use regulations, shall be accompanied
by a certification from an engineer or scientific testing laboratory approved
by the village board indicating that the use of the land and all processing
either does or will comply with the applicable performance standards.
   C.   Investigation For Noncompliance: Complaints by an individual or
individuals of noncompliance with these standards shall be investigated by the
zoning enforcement officer. Upon completion of his investigation, if scientific
test and investigation is deemed desirable, he shall so inform the board of
appeals who shall evaluate the recommendation and subsequently recommend to the
village board that a scientific test be carried out. This test shall be carried
out by qualified professionals. If such test reveals violation of the
performance standards, the village board shall take the prudent actions
necessary to assure compliance by any violator with the performance standards
and other pertinent provisions of this title. (1984 Code § 5-8-1)
10-11-2: NOISE:
   A.   Sound levels shall be measured with a sound level meter and associated
octave band filter manufactured according to standards prescribed by the
American Standards Association. Measurements shall be made using the flat
network of the sound level meter. Impulse type noises shall be subject to the
performance standards hereinafter prescribed; provided, that such noises that
shall be capable of being so measured, for the purpose of this title, shall be
those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level
meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two (±2) decibels. Noise
incapable of being so measured, such as those of an irregular and intermittent
nature, shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent
properties.
   B.   At no point on the boundary of property shall the sound pressure level
of any operation other than background noises not directly under the control of
the property owner exceed the decibel limits in the octave bands designated
below: (1984 Code § 5-8-2; amd. 2010 Code)

10-11-4: SMOKE AND PARTICULATE MATTER:
   A.   Any use already established on the effective date hereof shall be
permitted to be altered, enlarged, expanded or modified; provided, that new
sources of smoke and/or particulate matter conform to the performance standards
established hereinafter for the district in which such use is located. The
total emission weight of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of the lot shall not exceed the net amount permitted in the district
in which the use is located after such alteration, enlargement, expansion or
modification.
   B.   In addition to the performance standards specified hereinafter, the
emission of smoke or particulate matter in such manner or quantity as to be
detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or welfare is
hereby declared to be a public nuisance and shall henceforth be unlawful.
   C.   For the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann chart,
published and used by the United States bureau of mines, shall be employed. The
emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density equal to no. 2 on the
Ringelmann chart is prohibited at all times, except as otherwise provided
hereinafter.
   D.   The emission, from all sources within any lot area, of particulate
matter containing more than five percent (5%) by weight of particles having a
particle diameter larger than forty four (44) microns is prohibited.
   E.   Dust and other types of air pollution, borne by the wind from such
sources as storage areas, yards, roads, and so forth, within lot boundaries
shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, oiling, or other
acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such sources in excess of
the weight limitations specified hereinafter for the district in which such use
shall be located is prohibited.
   F.   1. In the I-1 and I-2 districts, all uses shall comply with the state
environmental protection agency air pollution control regulations dated
December 1976 or updated versions as they occur after December 1976.
      2.   Particulate emission standard and limitations rule 203 of the state
standards shall apply to all I-1 and I-2 districts as follows and as excerpted

11-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
This title shall be known, referred to and cited as the 1984 LAND SUBDIVISION
ORDINANCE OF THE VILLAGE OF SHERMAN, ILLINOIS. (1984 Code §
6-1-1)
11-1-2: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
   A.   The purpose of this title is to regulate and control the division of
land within the plat approval jurisdiction of the village, to prevent the
subdivision of land for uses to which the land is not suited, and to prevent
serious hazards and problems to the citizens of the community. This title will
provide for the improvement of the public health and safety; the harmonious
development of the village and its environs; the coordination of streets,
public areas, and other features of the official village plan; and the
protection of the community's taxable resources by requiring that subdivisions
be designed and developed so as not to impose excessive maintenance burdens on
the community, but at the same time allow for reasonable development costs for
the developer and homeowner.
   B.   This title is intended to establish regulations specifically needed to:
      1.   Provide for the orderly division of land by requiring the proper
description, monumentation, and recording of subdivided lands.
      2.   Provide reasonable protection and conservation of those natural
resources (land, air, vegetation, water) upon which the continued prosperity,
safety, health, and welfare of the community may depend.
      3.   Prevent scattered development beyond the reasonable service area of
the community facilities and utilities.
   C.   It is also the intention of this title that any land divided hereunder
shall result in the creation of lots that are of sufficient size and shape to
be practically used and that will serve the public in a reasonable fashion over
a long period of time. (1984 Code §
6-1-3)
11-1-3: JURISDICTION:
The plat jurisdiction of the village shall include all land within the
corporate limits of the village and all unincorporated land within one and one-
half (11/2) miles of the corporate limits of the village, except when a
contractual agreement has been established between Sherman and other
municipalities concerning jurisdictional powers in the one and one-half (11/2)
mile overlap areas between the two (2) municipalities. The village will then
have subdivision control in that portion of the overlap area established by the
agreement. (1984 Code §
6-1-2)
11-1-3-1: PLAT; WHEN REQUIRED:
It shall be unlawful for a subdivider of land within the subdivision
jurisdiction of the Village of Sherman to subdivide land into lots, blocks,
streets, alleys, or public open space unless by plat in accordance with the
laws of the State of Illinois and the provisions of this title. It shall be
unlawful to divide land without obtaining tract survey approval, when required.
   A.   The provisions of this title shall not apply, except as noted with
respect to tract surveys, and no plat is required in any of the following
instances:
      1.   The division or subdivision of land into parcels or tracts of five
(5) acres or more in size which does not involve any new streets or easements
of access;
      2.   The division of lots or blocks less than one acre in any recorded
subdivision which does not involve any new streets, easements of access or
drainage and utility easements;
      3.   The sale or exchange of parcels of land between owners of adjoining
and contiguous land where the transfer results in the same number of parcels;
      4.   The conveyance of parcels of land or interests therein for the use
as a right-of-way for railroads or other public utility facilities and other
pipe lines which does not involve any new streets or easements of access;
      5.   The conveyance of land owned by a railroad or other public utility
which does not involve any new streets or easements of access;
      6.   The conveyance of land for highway or other public purposes or
grants or conveyances relating to the dedication of land for public use or
instruments relating to the vacation of land impressed with a public use;
      7.   Conveyances made to correct descriptions in prior conveyances;
      8.   The sale or exchange of parcels or tracts of land following the
division into no more than two (2) parts of a particular parcel or tract of
land existing on July 17,1959 and not involving any new streets or easements of
access. If a division is made prior to 10-1-73 for which an exemption is
claimed pursuant to this subsection (A)(8), and the division results in one
part being greater than five (5) acres and the other part being less than five
(5) acres, then the subsequent division of the part greater than five (5) acres
shall qualify for the exemption set forth in subsection (A)(9) of this Section.
If a division is made on or after 10-1-73 for which an exemption is claimed
pursuant to this subsection (A)(8), and the division results in one part being
greater than five (5) acres and the other part being less than five (5) acres
then the subsequent division of the part greater than five (5) acres shall not
qualify for the exemption set forth in subsection (A)(9);
      9.   The sale of a single tract less than five (5) acres from a tract of
five (5) acres or larger when a survey is made by a registered land surveyor;
provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to the sale of any
subsequent lots from the same larger tract of land, as determined by the
dimensions and configuration of the larger tract on October 1,1973, and
provided that this exemption does not invalidate any other local requirements
applicable to the subdivision of the land. For the purpose of this subsection
(A)(9), if a tract of five (5) acres or greater existed prior to 10-1-73, its
division on or after 10-1-73 into two (2) parts, each of which is less than
five (5) acres, shall nevertheless qualify for the exemption set forth in this
subsection (A)(9).
   B.   A tract survey shall be required for a division or subdivision of land
for which no plat is required under subsection (A) for exceptions (1), (2),
(3), (8) and (9). A survey may not be required if the resulting parcel is ten
(10) acres or more and can be described as a fractional part in increments of
quarter or half sections. A survey may also not be required under (A)(3) if the
conveyance can be described by lineal feet of road frontage or lot line and
with the portion perpendicular to the frontage being parallel to the common
lot. (Ord. 2017-4, 3-21-2017)

11-4-1: NOTICES TO ENGINEER:
   A.   Construction: The engineer for the village shall be notified at least
forty eight (48) hours prior to commencement of construction. The notification
of construction shall include a written notice of the start of construction
date and an oral discussion with the engineer for the village concerning the
proposed construction plan and schedule. (1984 Code § 6-7-1)
   B.   Plan And Schedule Changes: The engineer for the village shall be
notified in writing of any changes to the proposed plan of construction or
schedule at least twenty four (24) hours before the changes are implemented.
(1984 Code § 6-7-2)
11-4-2: INSPECTIONS GENERALLY:
   A.   Right Of Inspection; Stop Work Order: The village reserves the right to
inspect the progress of the construction work to ensure the approved plans and
specifications are being followed. The subdivider/contractor will be notified
with a stop order of any work found to be unacceptable subsequent to inspection
(s) by village representative(s). Proceeding in violation of a stop order is a
violation of this title. (1984 Code § 6-7-3)
   B.   Inspection Of Materials; Certificates: Materials to be used on the job
may be subject to inspection at the source or at the construction site.
Construction work may be inspected at the time of construction and also
following construction. All material which becomes a permanent part of the
subdivision improvements must be certified, by the manufacturer or by tests, to
meet specifications. Documentation of these certifications is the
responsibility of the subdivider's engineer. (1984 Code § 6-7-6)
11-4-3: PRESENCE OF CERTAIN PERSONS DURING CONSTRUCTION:
   A.   The subdivider's engineer shall have a full time, qualified resident
observer present on the construction site for the following:
      1.   Approval of the subgrade prior to paving.
      2.   Continuous observation of all phases of the paving operation,
construction of sanitary sewer mains and appurtenances, and construction of
storm sewers and appurtenances. (1984 Code § 6-7-4)
   B.   The subdivider's contractor shall have a superintendent on the job site
at all times while construction is in progress. The superintendent shall be
responsible for the entire construction procedure. In his absence, the
superintendent shall indicate to the subdivider's observer the person
temporarily responsible for the conduct of the work. (1984 Code § 6-7-5)
11-4-4: PAVEMENT CORES:
Newly constructed pavements shall be cored at the subdivider's expense. Two (2)
cores shall be provided every five hundred feet (500') on alternative sides of
the pavement to check the thickness of the paving. Location of the cores to be
taken shall be as directed by the engineer for the village. If thin pavement
sections are discovered, additional cores shall be taken to determine the
extent of the thin area(s). (1984 Code § 6-7-7)
11-4-5: FINAL INSPECTION; DEFICIENCIES:
   A.   The subdivider and/or his engineer, in the accompaniment of the
engineer for the village, shall make a final inspection of all improvements
constructed in conjunction with the subdivision to determine final acceptance
by the village. (1984 Code § 6-7-8)
   B.   If the final inspection indicates no deficient items, the village shall
take formal action to accept the completed streets for maintenance. (1984 Code
§ 6-7-9)
   C.   Should any item need correction or repair, the subdivider will be
notified in writing of each deficiency. No street(s) will be accepted in a
subdivision until all streets comply with the village requirements to the
satisfaction of the engineer for the village and the trustee for public works.
   D.   Should the subdivider fail to properly correct any of the deficiencies,
he shall be responsible for all maintenance until such time as the streets are
completely acceptable to the village. Under this situation, the subdivider's
maintenance responsibility shall be construed to include, but not be limited
to, snow and ice control, regular mowing of the parkways, periodic cleaning of
storm sewers and catch basins, etc. Should the subdivider fail to discharge any
of these responsibilities, he will be notified to rectify the situation(s) by
the village clerk. Failure to take the necessary remedial action(s) within
thirty (30) calendar days after such notification may result in a fine not to
exceed seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) with a similar such fine for every
fourteen (14) calendar day period beyond the initial thirty (30) days during
which the necessary repairs/maintenance activities are not completed. (1984
Code § 6-7-9; amd. 2010 Code)
   E.   It should be noted that regardless of whether or not the street(s) has
been accepted by the village for maintenance, no occupancy permits shall be
issued for any residential structure(s) until such time as the builder has
cleaned all debris and mud from the pavement, gutter, etc., in the nearby
vicinity of the subject structure. (1984 Code § 6-7-9)
11-4-6: AS BUILT PLANS:
Subsequent to the satisfactory inspection of the completed improvements, the
subdivider shall have prepared a set of as built plans for each of the
improvements constructed. Such plans shall show all public facilities as built
on the surface and underground, both on public property and on easements, and
shall also indicate all private utility locations that are known. The as built
plans shall carry the seal of a registered professional engineer, who shall
certify that construction was completed and material used was in conformance
with the plans and specifications. These plans shall be submitted to the
village clerk within sixty (60) days of the date of the final inspection. (1984
Code § 6-7-10)

DESIGN AND LAYOUT STANDARDS
SECTION:
11-5-1: General Requirements
11-5-2: Lots
11-5-3: Subdivision Layout
11-5-4: Street And Alley Improvements
11-5-5: Drainage And Storm Sewers
11-5-6: Grading And Clearing
11-5-7: Water Distribution System
11-5-8: Sanitary Sewer Facilities
11-5-9: Appendices
11-5-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Streets, storm drainage, sanitary sewer systems, and water treatment
and distribution represent the four (4) major public investments in a
community. Obviously, these improvements should be permanent enduring assets to
a community. In order to assure that these improvements in a subdivision are
worthy of acceptance by the village, this chapter sets forth the appropriate
design and construction standards necessary to achieve that goal.
   B.   The design and improvement standards set forth herein shall be deemed
minimum requirements for public health, safety, and general welfare. Nothing
contained in these standards shall be construed to mean that the subdivider
cannot construct additional improvements of a higher quality.
   C.   Any tract of land that is unsuitable for development due to probable
flooding, poor drainage, rough topography, adverse soil conditions, excessive
noise, or other conditions, which, in the opinion of the village board, will
prove detrimental to the health, safety and/or general welfare of future
inhabitants of that tract and/or adjacent parcels shall not be subdivided
unless the developer formulates plans/methods which the village board deems
adequate to solve the potential problems engendered by said adverse land
conditions.
   D.   The standards and requirements of this chapter shall apply to all new
subdivisions of land, and they shall be interpreted to encourage and facilitate
better physical quality of land development in the village. (1984 Code § 6-8-1)
   E.   The use of jetting for trench backfill for the construction of sewers,
water main, or other utilities shall be prohibited. (Ord. 2017-4, 3-21-2017)
11-5-2: LOTS:
   A.   Monuments: Reference monuments shall be set, in the field, at the
corners of all lots platted in accordance with the plat act, 765 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 205/0.01 et seq., as amended from time to time. (1984 Code §
6-8-2; amd. 2010 Code)
   B.   Size And Configuration:
      1.   Lot Size: All lots shall have the minimum width and areas required
by the village zoning ordinance; except, that where on site sewage disposal is
proposed, the following additional requirements regarding lot width and area
must be observed to protect the public health and welfare: lots for single-
family detached dwellings shall have a minimum size of twenty thousand (20,000)
square feet (excluding easements) and a minimum lot frontage of one hundred
feet (100') at the building line, provided the subdivider can prove to the
satisfaction of the planning committee that the soil and the lot area for the
septic system is suitable for the absorption of septic tank effluent without
contamination of any drinking water supply or creating undesirable sanitary
conditions. The soil must have an acceptable percolation rate without
interference from groundwater or impervious strata below the level of the
absorption system. In every such case, the septic system shall conform to the
requirements of the Illinois department of public health in effect at the time
of the submission of the preliminary plan. Unless these conditions are met, the
engineer for the village may deem that the site is unsuitable for subsurface
sewage disposal systems.
      2.   Building Setbacks: The building setback lines shall conform to the
front yard and side yard setback lines set forth in the village zoning
ordinance.
      3.   Through Lots: Double frontage lots shall not be permitted except by
planning committee approval in instances where: a) lots back upon a
thoroughfare; and b) topographic or other conditions make subdividing otherwise
unreasonable, then such double frontage lots shall have an additional depth of
at least twenty feet (20') for a protective screen planting on one frontage.
Every lot having multiple frontages (e.g., corner lots, through lots) shall be
large enough to permit compliance with the zoning ordinance front setback
requirement on every side of the lot abutting a street.
      4.   Length/Width Ratio: Generally, in the interest of "good planning",
the length of any lot should not be greater than three (3) times the width of
said lot, unless topography or other conditions dictate otherwise.
      5.   Lot Remnants: All lot remnants shall be added to adjacent lots to
avoid the creation of nonconforming lots.
      6.   Relationship Of Side Lot Lines To Street Lines: All side lot lines
should be approximately at right angles to straight street right of way lines
and radial to curved street right of way lines except where a deviation from
this rule will result in a better street/lot design. Along curvilinear street
lines, side lines of lots formed by converging radial projections shall form a
lot having not less than twenty feet (20') across the rear property line.
      7.   Access: Land shall be subdivided in such away that each lot has
direct access to a public street.
      8.   Satisfactory Building Sites: The design and arrangement of lots
should be such that each lot will provide a satisfactory building site. Lots
abutting upon watercourses, drainageways, channels, or streams shall have an
additional depth or width as required to provide an acceptable building site.
   C.   Natural/Historical Features: Whenever any tract is to be subdivided,
the most restrictive measures consistent with the anticipated development of
the tract should be taken to protect such natural features as tree growth,
wetlands, steep slopes, watercourses, and any historically or archaeologically
significant structures/sites.
   D.   Numbering Lots: Lots shall be numbered consecutively throughout all
phases or additions of the subdivision, and the same basic subdivision name
shall be given to all parts thereof. (1984 Code § 6-8-2)
11-5-3: SUBDIVISION LAYOUT:
   A.   Sizes Of Blocks: In residential subdivisions, blocks shall not be less
than four hundred feet (400') nor more than one thousand two hundred feet
(1,200') in length, measured along the greatest dimensions of the enclosed
block area. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow lots of minimum depth of one
hundred feet (100').
   B.   Street Plan:
      1.   General Requirements: The arrangement, character, extension, width
and location of all streets shall be considered in their relationship to
existing and planned streets; to reasonable circulation of traffic within the
subdivision and adjoining lands; to topographic conditions; to runoff of
stormwater; to public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate
relationship to the proposed uses of the area to be served. It is the policy of
the village to encourage internal circulation in new subdivisions. Plats
showing single lot access to state/county highways will not be approved without
written assurance from the state/county highway department that access permits
will be granted.
      2.   Plan/Profile Specifications: Contained below in table 5.1 are the
minimum street specifications that apply specifically to residential
subdivisions. At the recommendation of the engineer for the village, the
village board may require higher standards consistent with accepted engineering
practices for streets in nonresidential subdivisions. Appropriate street
classifications shall be determined and/or verified by the engineer for the
village and/or village board at the time of submittal of the preliminary plat.

      3.   Horizontal Curves:
         a.   Where there is curvilinear horizontal alignment utilized for
subdivision streets, the minimum centerline radius to be used shall be as
indicated below:
 
Land access and local streets 150 feet
Collector street              300 feet
Arterial street               300 feet
 
         b.   If reserve curves are to be utilized, and the radii are less than
three hundred feet (300'), a tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long
should be introduced between the curves on collector streets and arterial
streets.
      4.   Vertical Curves: All grade changes shall be connected by vertical
curves. The length of vertical curves on major thoroughfares shall not be less
than thirty (30) times the algebraic difference in rates of grade, and not less
than fifteen (15) times the algebraic difference in rates of grade on all other
streets. The minimum length of vertical curves on all types of streets shall be
ten feet (10').
      5.   Topographical Considerations: Grades of streets shall conform as
closely as possible to the natural topography, but shall not exceed the maximum
grade nor be less than the minimum grade specified in table 5.1 of this
section. All streets shall be arranged so that as many as possible of the
potential building sites are at or above street grade.
      6.   Traffic Flow: Land access/local streets shall be laid out in such a
manner as to discourage use by through traffic. To effect a more desirable
street layout, the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or U-shaped streets
is encouraged. Rigid rectangular gridiron street patterns should be avoided for
land access and local streets.
      7.   Additional Width Of Existing Streets: Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional right of way if necessary to meet
the minimum street width requirements set forth in this section as follows:
         a.   The entire additional right of way shall be provided where the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
         b.   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one-half (1/2) or more of the required additional right of way shall be
provided as deemed necessary by the planning committee or village board.
      8.   Half Streets: Half streets shall be prohibited except where
essential to reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other
requirements of this title and when the planning committee finds that it will
be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided.
      9.   Private Streets And Reserve Strips: There shall be no private
streets platted in any subdivision. Every subdivided lot shall be served from a
dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to
streets, and there shall be no reserve strips or areas enabling access to
interior lots from streets in residential subdivisions.
      10.   Dead End Streets: Dead end streets shall be either temporary stub
streets or permanent cul-de-sac streets.
         a.   Temporary Stub Streets: Streets shall be so arranged as to
provide the continuation of collector streets between adjacent properties when
such continuation is consistent with good transportation planning and/or is
necessary for adequate traffic circulation, effective fire and police
protection, and efficient provision of utilities. If a street must dead end
temporarily because the adjacent property is undeveloped, the right of way
shall be extended to the property line, and no strip that would prevent
connections with future streets shall be reserved. A temporary all weather
surface turnabout with a minimum radius of thirty feet (30') shall be provided
at the terminus of any temporary dead end street that serves more than four (4)
lots.
         b.   Permanent Cul-De-Sac Streets: The terminus of a permanent cul-
de-sac street shall not be closer than one hundred feet (100') to the boundary
of an adjacent tract. A cul-de-sac turnaround, having a minimum right of way
radius of sixty feet (60') and a minimum pavement radius of fifty feet (50')
(measured to the back of curb and/or gutter) shall be provided at the end of
every permanent cul-de-sac street. Cul-de-sacs shall not be more than five
hundred feet (500') in length (measured from street of origin to end of right
of way) unless necessitated by some unusual conditions of topography.
      11.   Alleys: Alleys are not permitted in residential areas unless deemed
necessary by the planning committee.
      12.   Pedestrianways: Pedestrianways with a minimum width of ten feet
(10') may be provided to facilitate pedestrian movement in the neighborhood.
Such way is recommended in all blocks that are more than eight hundred feet
(800') long and for access to community facilities that do not have pedestrian
access from two (2) or more streets.
      13.   Street Names: Every proposed street which is obviously in alignment
with an existing named street shall be given the same name as the existing
street. The name assigned to any proposed street which is not in alignment with
an existing named street shall not duplicate nor be phonetically similar to the
name of any existing street regardless of any difference in designation such as
"Avenue", "Boulevard", "Drive", "Place", "Court", etc. (1984 Code § 6-8-3)
      14.   Street Numbers: Street numbers in any block of any proposed
subdivision shall correspond and conform with the numerical grid system set
forth in exhibit A attached to the ordinance codified herein which is hereby
adopted by the village for purposes of assigning address numbers to residences,
commercial buildings and other structures located within the village.
Residences, commercial buildings and other structures located along the north
and west sides of any street shall be odd numbered; residences, commercial
buildings and other structures located along the south and east sides of any
street shall be even numbered. Street signs placed at corners within any
subdivision shall bear, in addition to the requirements contained in subsection
11-5-4E of this chapter, a number indicating the corresponding location of the
particular block with respect to the grid system adopted in exhibit A attached
to the ordinance codified herein.
   C.   Intersections:
      1.   Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point.
Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. In no case shall two (2) streets intersect at an angle of less than
seventy degrees (70°). An oblique (less than 70 degrees) street shall be curved
approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles with
said intersection for at least one hundred feet (100') therefrom, unless the
subdivider's engineer recommends, and the engineer for the village concurs,
that a lesser distance would be in accordance with safe and accepted traffic
engineering practices.
      2.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersection on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred twenty five feet (125') are prohibited unless the intersected
street has divided lanes without median breaks at either intersection.
      3.   Returns at intersections shall be made concentric and shall be
rounded by a radius of not less than twenty feet (20') at the right of way
line, and not less than thirty feet (30') at the back of curb line.
      4.   An area having no greater than a three percent (3%) slope for a
distance of seventy five feet (75') from the centerline of the intersection
should be provided for any approach to an intersection.
      5.   The cross slope on all streets, including intersections, should not
exceed three percent (3%).
      6.   Whenever any proposed intersection involves earth banks or existing
vegetation within fifty feet (50') of the intersection of curb lines, such
ground and/or vegetation shall be cut in conjunction with the grading of the
public right of way to the extent necessary to provide an adequate sight
distance 1 .
   D.   Easements: At locations within the subdivision where utilities and
drainage facilities are not to be constructed within public rights of way, the
subdivider shall make provision for easements for such installations.
Preliminary plats shall be submitted to the electric, gas, and telephone
companies for their input regarding easements.
      1.   Utility Easements: Utility easements, not less than twenty feet
(20') wide for sanitary sewers and not less than ten feet (10') wide for water
mains, gas, electric, telephone and cable TV, shall be provided where
necessary. Normally, in the case of abutting lots, an equal amount should be
taken from each lot. Property owners may (at their own risk) plant shrubbery or
hedges or install fences on the easement areas. Utilities (private and public),
however, in order to have access for repair, shall have the election to destroy
said improvements and restore the area only by grading and seeding or to have
alternate access through the owner's property.
      2.   Drainage Easements: Easements of adequate width for stormwater
drainage (surface or storm sewer) shall be provided as necessary for
satisfactory disposal of stormwater runoff. In no case shall such easements be
less than ten feet (10') in width. Easements for drainage retention shall be
provided as necessary.
      3.   Electric, Telephone, And Cable Television Lines: Electric,
telephone, and cable television (if any) service lines shall be installed
underground throughout every residential subdivision whenever feasible.
Underground service connections shall be provided at the property line of each
platted lot. All such conduits or cables shall be located within easements or
public rights of way in such a manner that they do not interfere with other
underground services/utilities. No underground utilities shall be constructed
until their physical location is approved in writing by the village board.
Utility companies shall submit the proposed layout of their facilities on paper
to the village for use in the approval process.
      4.   Ground Subject To Periodic Flooding: Where a subdivision is
traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be
provided a drainage easement conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse. It shall include an additional area, ten feet (10') wide,
adjoining both edges of the established area that would be affected by the 100-
year storm, as certified by the subdivider or his engineer.
   E.   Dedication/Reservation Of Right Of Way:
      1.   Dedicated Right Of Way Required:
         a.   The subdivider shall dedicate at least the minimum right of way
indicated in table 5.1 of this section whenever he proposes to build any of the
listed streets.
         b.   Whenever the subdivider proposes to build any of the listed
streets, he shall dedicate the right of way in excess of the stated minimum
where, in the professional opinion of the engineer for the village:
            (1)   Due to topography, additional width is necessary to provide
adequate sight lines; and
            (2)   Due to the location of streams, railroad tracks, etc.,
additional width is needed to construct bridges, underpasses, and/or safe
approaches thereto.
      2.   Reservation Of Right Of Way: The subdivider shall reserve the right
of way whenever the subdivision abuts an existing street that does not meet the
standards set forth in table 5.1 of this section. The subdivider shall reserve
sufficient right of way along the side of the street abutting the subdivision
so that, when additional right of way is acquired on the other side, it will be
possible to comply with said standards.
      3.   Right Of Way Part Of Minimum Setback: Any land that is dedicated or
reserved for public right of way shall not be counted in determining compliance
with the lot size and setback requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance.
   F.   Reservation Of Land For Public Purposes: When a school board, park
board, municipality, or the county has gone on record as desiring to purchase a
parcel(s) in a proposed subdivision for school, park, or other public purpose,
the owner or subdivider shall reserve said parcel(s) for acquisition of such
public entity for a period of twelve (12) months beginning on the date the
final plat is recorded. If, within this twelve (12) month period, an
acquisition price cannot be agreed upon or condemnation proceedings have not
been instituted, the owner or subdivider may sell, subdivide, or otherwise
dispose of said parcel(s). (1984 Code § 6-8-3)
   G.   Dedication Of Park Land Or Payment Of Fees In Lieu Thereof: As a
condition of approval of a preliminary plan of a subdivision or large scale
development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for
park and recreational purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the development and village or to distribute cash in lieu of
actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village,
in accordance with the following criteria and formula:
      1.   Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreation Land Dedication:
         a.   Requirement And Population Ratio: For purposes of this dedication
requirement, the developer shall dedicate to the village one thousand four
hundred fifty (1,450) square feet of real estate per dwelling unit in the
proposed development.
         b.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas:
            (1)   Where private open space for park and recreational purposes
is provided in a proposed subdivision, and such space is to be owned and
maintained by the residents of that residential development, such areas shall
be credited against the requirements of dedication for park and recreation
purposes. In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks
will imply a substantial degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment, by the developer as part of his
obligation. When the private open space includes improvements and the
installation of recreation facilities, one-half (1/2) of the land area which
would be required for dedication under this title shall be sufficient for
credit for private open space.
            (2)   Detailed plans for private open space, including
specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village,
and before any credit is given, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that
these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by
the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs are
included in this provision.
            (3)   If the amount of private open space is less than the amount
required for credit for private open space, the remainder shall be made up in
land dedication or fees.
      2.   Determination Of Land Dedication Or Fees In Lieu Thereof: Whether
the board accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu
thereof, or a combination, shall be determined by consideration of the
following:
         a.   Size and share of the residential development and land available
for dedication.
         b.   Topography, geology, access and location of land in the
subdivision.
         c.   The determination of the village board of trustees as to whether
land shall be dedicated or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination
thereof, shall be final and conclusive.
      3.   Procedure:
         a.   Action Of Village: At the time of preliminary plan approval for
the subdivision, the board shall determine, as part of such approval, whether
to require a dedication of land within the subdivision, payment of a fee in
lieu thereof, a combination of both, or if private open space is adequate. If
land is to be dedicated, the preliminary plan of subdivision shall indicate
such dedications. If cash dedications are to be used in lieu of land
dedications, the amount of cash dedications and the computations that resulted
in determining said amount shall be submitted in writing by the developer at
the time the preliminary plan of subdivision is filed. It shall be the
responsibility of the planning committee to make recommendations to the village
board regarding the adequacy of the proposed land dedication or cash donation
in lieu of land dedication.
         b.   Prerequisites For Approval Of Final Plat: Where dedication is
required, it shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of
Illinois Compiled Statutes. Where fees are required, the same shall be
deposited with the village clerk prior to board approval of the final plat of
subdivision. Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities
shall be submitted to the village prior to final approval and shall be recorded
contemporaneously with the final plat.
         c.   Determination Of Amount Of Fees: The cash contributions in lieu
of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the
residential development under consideration that otherwise would have been
dedicated as a park.
         d.   Determination Of Fair Market Value: Fair market value shall be
determined as of the time of filing the final plat of subdivision in accordance
with the following:
            (1)   The fair market value as determined by the village board
based upon current appraisals; or
            (2)   If the subdivider or developer objects to such amount of
evaluation, he may, at his expense, obtain an appraisal of the property by a
qualified real estate appraiser approved by the village, which appraisal may be
accepted by the village board of trustees if found reasonable; or
            (3)   The village and subdivider may agree as to the fair market
value.
      4.   Uses Of Fees In Lieu:
         a.   Parks: Cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land
dedication shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body
designated by the village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation
land which will be available to serve immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development, or for the improvement of the
existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs.
         b.   Refunded Fees In Lieu: If any portion of a cash contribution is
not expended within fifteen (15) years from the date of receipt, it shall be
refunded to the developer who made such contribution. (1984 Code § 6-8-3)
   H.   Off Site Improvements: As a condition of approval of any preliminary or
final plat of subdivision, the village, at its discretion, may require any off
site improvements to adjacent streets, feeder streets, street curbs, water
mains, sanitary sewers, drains or other facilities for sewers and drains,
roadways, traffic signals or similar improvements as permitted by the laws of
the state, as amended from time to time. In addition, the village may enter
into an agreement with the developer or developers for the construction of off
site improvements and the apportionment of the cost of said off site
improvements between the developer's property and other properties benefited by
the improvements, and may agree to collect the proportionate share of such
costs for off site improvements from the developer or developers of other
properties benefited by the improvements as permitted by the statutes or the
laws of the state, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 1990-1, 2-6-1990; amd.

shall be provided at every other lot line on alternating sides of the street.
      3.   The location of the lights shall be shown on the construction plans
reviewed and approved by the engineer for the village.
      4.   If the developer uses lights provided by CILCO or Menard Electric,
they shall use their decorative poles. Any additional costs for decorative
poles shall be paid by the developer.
      5.   If the developer chooses to supply his own decorative lighting on
decorative poles, the following standards shall apply:
         a.   Mounting height of the luminaires from the base of poles to
center of bulb shall be sixteen feet (16'), plus or minus, depending on the

      6.   If the developer chooses to use decorative lighting on decorative
poles, the developer shall provide catalog cuts on the proposed lighting
equipment to the engineer for the village for approval before any equipment is
ordered.
      7.   a. The developer is responsible for maintenance of streetlights and
poles for one year after the subdivision plat is accepted by the village.
         b.   The village, in conjunction with the utility (CILCO or Menard
Electric), will maintain all streetlights, including decorative lights, after
the expiration of the one year period from acceptance by the village.
      8.   Streetlights shall be installed and operative within sixty (60) days
of the time the curbs are completed or the electrical service lines are
installed, whichever occurs last.
   H.   Addresses: Upon completion of construction of streets and curbs in any
subdivision within the village, where construction is completed after the
effective date hereof, the developer shall paint yellow numerals at least three
and one-half inches (31/2") in height on a six inch by twelve inch (6" x 12")
black background at the center of each lot on the surface of the curb or gutter
fronting each lot, indicating the street address or addresses established under

4-2010; Ord. 2017-4, 3-21-2017)
11-5-5: DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS:
Every residential subdivision shall be provided with drainage facilities which
can satisfactorily accommodate the stormwater surface runoff incident to the
10-year design storm. The drainage facilities in any commercial or industrial
subdivision shall be designed to handle stormwater runoff from the 15-year
design storm. These minimal design requirements shall not be construed to
relieve the subdivider of any legal responsibilities for downstream/upstream
stormwater damages inflicted by runoff or backup from the development.
   A.   General Design Considerations: The plans and specifications shall
include provisions to show compliance with the drainage laws of the state and
any subdivision thereof in effect at that time. By requiring that the
subdivider evidence compliance with drainage law(s), the village assumes no
responsibility to landowners or others for damage caused by noncompliance with
such law(s).
      1.   Storm Sewers: Properly sized storm sewers shall be provided to carry
surface runoff from streets and curb and/or gutters. Such storm sewers shall be
of sufficient length that they shall transport the runoff to rear lot lines or
existing natural drainageways or swales, provided their location does not
encroach upon the building site.
      2.   Drainage Swales: Natural drainage swales may be utilized to
accommodate surface runoff, provided they are located near lot lines and the
flows induced therein do not pose health or safety hazards for residents.
      3.   Accommodation Of Upstream Drainage Areas: Drainage facilities shall
be adequate to accommodate potential runoff from the entire drainage area
upstream of the proposed subdivision. Potential runoff shall be determined on
the basis of maximum land use of the upstream area that is consistent with
current zoning or adjacent land use trends.
      4.   Drainage Detention: In order to protect downstream property from
potential damages by increased flows or greater velocities, it may be necessary
for the subdivider to provide for drainage detention facilities. The village
reserves the right to require such installations where it is deemed necessary
in the interest of public safety and welfare. Drainage detention facilities
should be designed so that the post-development release rate does not exceed
the pre-development conditions for the 10-year and 100-year design storm.
      5.   Discharge From Groundwater Sumps 1 : All lots on which proposed
buildings will require the use of groundwater sumps to protect foundations and
floors from leaking must be provided with underground storm sewers designed to
carry the sump pump discharge to the street storm sewer system or surface
drainage easements. In no case will groundwater sump discharge be allowed to
drain either directly or indirectly onto village streets.
   B.   Technical Requirements: Storm drainage facilities shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the criteria set forth and the standards
contained in subsection
11-5-9B of this chapter.
      1.   Pipe/Storm Sewers: All pipe sewers shall be determined by
utilization of either the rational method, or the SCS method, or both, for the
design storm(s) previously specified.
         a.   The minimum diameter permitted shall be twelve inches (12")
except as indicated in subsection B1d of this section.
         b.   Pipes/storm sewers located under paved surfaces shall be
reinforced concrete pipe with rubber gasket joints and sufficient wall
thickness and reinforcement to carry the intended loading with the materials
meeting the requirements of ASTM C-76 and ASTM C-443.
         c.   Pipes/storm sewers located outside paved surfaces and under
nominal fill loading may be of any of the following materials:
            (1)   Plastic truss pipe meeting the requirements of ASTM D-2680.
            (2)   Corrugated aluminum pipe meeting the requirements of AASHTO
M-196, minimum plate thickness of 14-gauge for D = 12 inches to 27 inches; 12-
gauge for D = 30 inches and up.
            (3)   Reinforced concrete pipe with sufficient wall thickness and
reinforcement to carry the intended loading and meeting the requirements of
ASTM C-76.
            (4)   Bituminous coated corrugated galvanized steel pipe meeting
the requirements of AASHTO M-36 and M-190, minimum plate thickness of 16-gauge
for D = 12 inches to 21 inches; 14-gauge for D = 24 inches and up.
            (5)   Pipe types not listed shall be approved in writing by the
engineer for the village before use.
            (6)   The subdivider shall be responsible for increasing minimum
plate gauges as the final loading dictates.
         d.   For sump pump drainage only, four inch (4") corrugated plastic
drainage pipe may be used, provided design calculations indicate adequate
capacity. In addition, a four inch (4") cleanout meeting the approval of the
engineer for the village shall be provided at the intersection of the sump
discharge pipe and the four inch (4") drain pipe.
         e.   Installation shall be in accordance with "good practice". All
trenches for pipes/storm sewers that are located under paved surfaces and all
trenches outside of the subgrade where the inner edge of the trench is closer
than two feet (2') to the edge of the proposed pavement shall be properly
backfilled with fine aggregate, one hundred percent (100%) of which shall pass
the three-eighths inch (3/8") sieve.
      2.   Inlets/Catch Basins: The spacings for inlets/catch basins shall be
calculated such that the runoff from the design storm shall not encroach upon
the pavement by more than six feet (6'). Under no circumstances shall the
spacing exceed four hundred feet (400'). Inlets/catch basins shall be
constructed in accordance with the standards in subsection
11-5-9B of this chapter.
      3.   Drainage Grades: Minimum/maximum gradients of pipes/storm sewers and
earth drainageways/swales shall conform to the following criteria:
         a.   Pipes/storm sewers:
 
Minimum grade = 0.3%
Maximum grade = None; riprap and/or energy dissipators shall be utilized as
                needed at discharge points to minimize erosion
 
         b.   Earth drainage/swales:
 
Minimum grade = 0.5% - may reduce to 0.35% if they are paved with concrete
Maximum grade = 3.0% with no protection other than sod
              12.0% with paving, riprap and/or energy dissipators, etc.
 
      4.   Manholes: Manholes conforming to the requirements set forth in
subsection
11-5-9B of this chapter shall be installed to all changes in vertical grade or
horizontal alignment of storm sewers if at locations other than inlets/catch
basins. (Ord. 2001-35, 12-4-2001; amd. Ord. 2017-4, 3-21-2017)

  8-3-8 of this code.
11-5-6: GRADING AND CLEARING:
Grading and clearing necessitated by the construction of roadway and drainage
facilities shall be done in such a manner as to assure uniform subgrade support
with adequate bearing capacity to properly support the loading/structures to be
superimposed. In order to help achieve this result, the subdivider shall comply
with the following requirements:
   A.   Clearing And Grubbing: Prior to grading within the limits of the right
of way, the entire area to be affected with improvements (i.e., pavement,
water, sewer, drainage, etc.) shall be cleared of all tree stumps, roots,
brush, and other objectional materials and of all trees not intended for
preservation.
   B.   Embankments: Embankments to be constructed within the roadway right of
way by the subdivider shall be done in a manner compatible with good road
construction practices and in accordance with the following provisions:
      1.   Construction: Fills shall be constructed in lifts not to exceed
twelve inches (12") loose. No wood, trash, or other objectionable material
shall be placed in fills.
      2.   Compaction: Each lift shall be properly compacted to a density not
less than ninety percent (90%) of the maximum standard lab density as
determined by AASHTO T-99. The upper six inches (6") of embankment shall be
compacted to a minimum of ninety five percent (95%) of maximum standard lab
density. Large clods and excessively wet fill material shall be disked and/or
aerated as required to achieve the minimum required density and result in a
stable embankment. Compaction shall be achieved with a roller capable of
properly compacting the given type of embankment material. In the case of fine
grained soils, a sheepsfoot roller shall be deemed suitable.
      3.   Compaction Tests: The village may require the subdivider to furnish,
at his expense, results of field compaction tests for verification of proper
construction. Such tests shall be performed and certified by a respectable
testing lab or engineering firm.
   C.   Subgrades: In areas where embankment is to be placed, the material
shall be properly compacted up to subgrade elevation. In the case of cut
sections, the subgrade shall be cleared of all unsuitable material, including,

department has accepted maintenance responsibility for the newly constructed
water mains. (1984 Code § 6-8-7; amd. Ord. 2017-4, 3-21-2017)
11-5-8: SANITARY SEWER FACILITIES:
It is the sole responsibility of the subdivider to provide a sewage disposal
system complying with the regulations of the Illinois department of public
health (private sewage disposal licensing act and code 1 ), the Illinois
environmental protection agency, and the operator of the public sewer system to
be expanded. If the public sanitary sewer system is within seven hundred fifty
feet (750') of the proposed subdivision 2 , and said system has the available
capacity, the subdivider shall extend the existing system and sewer his entire
proposed development at his own expense.
   A.   Extension Of Existing Mains:
      1.   Plans Required: Whenever the existing public sanitary sewer system
is to be extended for a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall have
detailed construction plans prepared by a professional engineer registered in
the state of Illinois. The plans and necessary permit application papers
required by the Illinois environmental protection agency shall be submitted to
the village for approval by the engineer for the village and the chair of the
planning committee.
      2.   Scope Of Extension: The subdivider shall extend the sanitary sewer
system throughout the subdivision in such a manner as to service every lot. No
lot may remain unserved unless such exemption is made in writing by the village
clerk and specifically referenced by subdivision lot number.
      3.   Construction Requirements: The subdivider shall install a four inch
(4") service tap for each lot to be served with sufficient four inch (4")
service line to place the service a minimum of five feet (5') beyond the lot
lines of each lot. All design and construction shall be in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the current edition of the "Standard Specifications
For Water And Sewer Main Construction In Illinois". All principal sanitary
sewer lines shall be located within the street right of way or public easement.

and/or contractor shall provide a television inspection of the installed main.
      5.   Maintenance: The subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance
of the sewer main, manholes, lift station(s), and service connections until
such time as the engineer for the village accepts the paving and the grading
adjacent to the sewer as complete and accepted by the village.
      6.   Warranty: The subdivider shall be responsible for a one year period
after the village has received notice of beginning of operation of a sanitary
sewer system for all defective mains, manholes, lift stations, sewer taps,
backfill settlement, etc.
   B.   Alternate Methods Of Disposal:
      1.   In the event it is not possible or feasible for the subdivider to
extend the public sewer system into the proposed subdivision, for whatever
reason, the subdivider has the right to petition the village to install an
alternative method of sewage disposal. Any such petition shall be considered on
an individual basis with each case standing on its own merit. No subdivision
shall be approved without the village approval of the method of sewage
disposal.
      2.   Upon written approval of the village board, the subdivider may
install individual sewage disposal systems, provided the lot size is in excess
of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. If such installations are permitted,
they shall be designed and installed in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the requirements and regulations of the private sewage disposal
licensing act 1 and code of the Illinois department of public health. (1984
