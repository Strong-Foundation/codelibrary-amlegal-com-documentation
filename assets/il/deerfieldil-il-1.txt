efficient method of determining the eligibility of an applicant for health
insurance benefits pursuant to the Public Safety Employee Benefits Act (820
ILCS 320/1 et. seq.) ("PSEBA"). This Section is consistent with the obligations
of the Village under state law to provide health insurance benefits to certain
public safety employees who qualify for, and are determined by the Village to
be eligible to receive, continued health insurance coverage under the Village's
basic group health insurance plan pursuant to PSEBA.
   (b)   Application Process and Initial Review. All applications for benefits
pursuant to PSEBA must be submitted and will be considered according to the
following process:
      (1)   Application Form. Any person seeking PSEBA benefits from the
Village ("Applicant") must complete and submit to the Village the standard
application form prepared by the Village, and all supporting documentation
required by the application. The PSEBA application must be completed, sworn,
and notarized as to the content of the application.
      (2)   Time Period for Submission of Application. The completed
application for PSEBA benefits must be submitted either by hand delivery or
certified mail to the attention of the Village Manager, Village of Deerfield,
850 Waukegan Road, Deerfield, Illinois, 60015, not later than one year after

application for an Applicant who has timely filed an application for pension
benefits with the Village's Police Pension Fund Board will be the date that is
30 days after the date of any final ruling by the applicable pension board
concerning any duty-related disability.
      (3)   Processing of Application. Upon receipt of a timely, complete, and
executed application form, the Village Manager or their designee shall promptly
review the materials and other relevant information necessary or appropriate to
analyze whether the Applicant is eligible for PSEBA benefits. If the Village
determines that additional fact-finding is necessary or appropriate, the
Applicant will respond to a written request by the Village for additional
information not later than 30 days after receipt of the Village's request. If
the Applicant does not respond to or cooperate with the Village's written
request for additional information, the Village will send a reminder notice to
the Applicant explaining the duty of full cooperation in the fact-finding
process. If the Applicant does not provide the requested information or
otherwise cooperate with the Village within 21 days after receipt of such
additional notice, then the Village may deem the application for PSEBA benefits
to be withdrawn and waived.
      (4)   Initial Determination of Eligibility by Village Manager. The
Village Manager or their designee will review the facts contained in the
completed application, supporting materials, and any other information gathered
through any additional fact-finding. If the Village Manager or their designee
determines based on this review that the Applicant is eligible for PSEBA
benefits, the Village Manager or their designee will grant the Applicant's
request for benefits and coordinate the provision of benefits to the Applicant
consistent with PSEBA's requirements and Section 2-115.5(d) of this Code. If
the Village Manager or their designee determines that the Applicant is not

dog; 2) the person injured or threatened by the dog was abusing, assaulting or
physically threatening the dog or its offspring; or 3) the dog was responding
to pain or injury, or was acting to protect itself, its offspring, or its

shall be the duty of the applicant to replenish the performance guarantee and
to reimburse the Village for such costs within fourteen (14) days after written
demand by the Village.

portion thereof, without interest, to the applicant within thirty (30) days

Sec. 6-47A. Preventing Increased Damages:
   The village shall notify adjacent municipalities and the Illinois department
of transportation, division of water resources and the federal insurance
administration prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. The
flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse shall be maintained. No development in the SFHA shall create a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or
threat to public health and safety.
   (a)   Within the floodway identified on the flood boundary floodway map, the
following standards shall apply:
      (1)   Except as provided in this subsection (a), no development shall be
allowed which, acting in combination with existing or future similar works,
will cause any increase in the base flood elevation. The specific development
activities identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be considered as
meeting this requirement.
      (2)   No increase in the base flood elevation may be permitted unless:
         (A)   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the base flood elevation more than one-tenth foot (0.1') for the affected
hydraulic reach of the stream and will not increase flood damages or potential
flood damages;
         (B)   A permit has been issued by the Illinois department of
transportation, division of water resource as required in subsection (b) of
this section; and

      (1)   In addition to the other requirements of this article, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway (or in a riverine SFHA
where no floodway has been identified) shall not be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required
from the Illinois department of transportation, division of water resources,
issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
      (2)   The following activities may be constructed without the individual
permit required in this subsection (b) in accordance with statewide permits
issued by the Illinois department of transportation, division of water
resources; provided, the activities do not involve placement of fill, change of
grade or construction in the normal channel. Such activities must still meet
the other requirements of this article.
         (A)   The construction of underground utility lines not crossing a
lake or stream;
         (B)   The construction of light poles, signposts and similar
structures;
         (C)   The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields
(excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade;
         (D)   The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures
such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports;

from the strict provisions of this Article subject to compliance with the
provisions of section 60.6a of the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program and upon compliance with such other conditions as the Village
deems necessary to comply with the intent of this Article. (Ord. 0-88-43, 7-18-
88)
Sec. 6-50A. Disclaimer of liability.
   The degree of flood protection required by this Article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on occasion or the flood height may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that
development either inside or outside areas designated as an A Zone will be free
from flooding or damage. This Article does not create liability on the part of
the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
Sec. 6-51A. Filling.
   The filling of lands where the existing ground elevation is less than the
flood base elevation shall be permitted provided:
   (a)   That the material is obtained from adjacent areas lying below the
flood base elevation or
   (b)   That the fill material obtained elsewhere is offset by the removal of
an equivalent volume of material obtained in the immediate vicinity of the
building site from elevations lower than the flood base elevation. If fill or
any type of construction which would displace flood waters is placed within the
flood plain, a flood reservoir shall be constructed (the bottom of which shall
not be lower than the bottom of the adjacent water course) equal in volume to
the volume of such fill or construction deposited below the flood base
elevation. Each such flood reservoir shall have adequate provision for drainage
to the waterway. The deepening of a water course is permitted, but the material
removed must not be deposited below the flood base elevation, except in
accordance with (b) above. The placement of fill material shall parallel the
water course. (M.C. 1963, § 22.901; Ord. No. 0-64-29)
Sec. 6-52A. Foundations - Waterproofing.
   All walls, floors, and slabs below grade shall be waterproofed by the
application of mastic and fabric materials to the exterior of the wall, and
beneath the wall and floor slab, with appropriate water stops at all other
joints as shown in Koppers Bulletin AIA No. 12b, p23-p26 or the equivalent. If
hydrostatic pressure is prevented by an adequate drainage system, such as
outlined in Section 6-44, the walls need only be damp-proofed, as shown in
Koppers Bulletin AIA No. 12B, p26 and 27 or the equivalent, and joints sealed
with pitch without the need for an impervious membrane. (M.C. § 22.903(b); Ord.
No. 0-64-29)
Sec. 6-53A. Foundations - Floor construction.
   All floors at grade or below grade subject to hydrostatic pressure shall be
designed to resist a uniformly distributed uplift equal to the full hydrostatic
pressure, unless a system of exterior footing drains and under floor drains are
installed to prevent the development of such hydrostatic pressure in the event
that the soils at the site of the building are highly impervious and the only
water seepage anticipated is penetration downward from ground surface rather
than upward from below, the exterior footing drain system would be considered
adequate without the requirement of an under floor drainage system with the
approval of the Director of Building and Zoning. (M.C. 1963, § 22.903(c); Ord.
No. 0-64-29; renumbered Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
Sec. 6-54A. Foundations - Grading around building.
   Wherever building sites are or may be subject to flooding, the lot shall be
sloped one foot (1') to fifteen feet (15') around each building and shall be
filled up to about six inches (6") or one foot (1') below the minimum sill
elevation for building openings and maintained at an elevation one foot (1')
above the flood base elevation for the site at a minimum distance of fifteen
feet (15') from the building. On building sites located on higher ground, the
surface of each lot shall be graded so as to slope away from each building and
provide a shallow swale between adjoining properties. (M.C. 1963, § 22.903(c);
Ord. No. 0-64-29; renumbered Ord. 0-77-60, 9-19-77)
Sec. 6-55A. Footing and under floor drains.
   (a)   Footing drains around the foundation shall be a minimum four (4)
inches in diameter, installed on the outside of the footings and shall be
properly surrounded with granular filter material. The granular filter material
shall be well graded from fine to coarse to prevent washing of fines from the
surrounding soils into the drains while at the same time maintaining adequate
permeability for the flow of water into the drains.
   (b)   The grain size requirements for satisfactory filter materials are
defined by the following formula:
      D15 (Filter 4   D 15 (Filter
      D85 (of Protected Soil   D 15 (of Protected Soil
      Where D15 (Filter) = 15% size of filter material from graduation curve
      D15 (of Protected Soils) = 15% size of protected soil from gradation
curve
      D85 (of Protected Soil) = 85% size of protected soil from gradation curve
   In order to assure adequate permeability of the filter material, the minimum
D15 size of filter material shall be equal to the #60 sieve size (.0098).
   The maximum permissible opening between tiles shall be no more than 1/2 the
D85 size of the filter material.

discharges must connect all downspouts and sump discharges to the available
storm sewer system, unless the village engineer determines that downstream
sewer capacity is insufficient, or that a direct connection of downspouts and
sump discharges to the available storm sewer system is not necessary to prevent
an increased burden upon adjoining property by reason of stormwater runoff in
accordance with applicable laws and best engineering practices.
   (b)   Prepare downstream sewer capacity analysis for existing and proposed
conditions prior to connecting to the public storm sewer.
   (c)   Demonstrate and quantify the existing and proposed runoff volume, rate

   The Business Facade Rebate Program is intended to encourage the improvement

   The Program seeks to encourage private investment in the Village, enhance
the overall tax base of local taxing districts by furthering development and
improvement of eligible private building facades and sites in the Village, as
well as to provide assistance to the independent merchant who may be otherwise
unable to afford the improvements. The Program further seeks to improve the
safety and accessibility of commercial districts and create a greater sense of
community, improve pedestrian walkability, and improve the overall aesthetics
of commercial districts.
   The Village has determined that the Program should be taken to implement
these initiatives. The Program provides limited grants for eligible
improvements to existing buildings occupied by businesses. The goal of the
Program is to provide both assistance and incentive to property owners and

business. (Ord. 0-21-50, 12-20-2021)

and maintenance of such development project and for an adequate depreciation
account in connection therewith.
   (c)   To pledge to the punctual payment of bonds authorized under this

advisable by the Board of Trustees. Pending the preparation of the definitive
bonds, interim receipts or certificates in such form and with such provisions
as the Board of Trustees may determine, may be issued to the purchaser or
purchasers of bonds sold pursuant to this Article. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-81)

   (b)   Any ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds under this Article may
provide that the principal of and interest on any bonds issued under this
Article shall be secured by a mortgage or trust deed covering such development
project and any improvements or extensions thereafter made. Such mortgage or
trust deed may contain such covenants and agreements to safeguard properly the
bonds as may be provided for in the ordinance authorizing such bonds and shall
be executed in such manner as may be provided for in such ordinance. The
provisions of this Article and any such ordinance and any such mortgage or
trust deed shall constitute a contract with the holder or holders of the bonds
which will continue in effect until the principal of, the interest on, and the
redemption premiums, if any, on the bonds so issued have been fully paid. The
Village may, in any such ordinance, agree that the duties of the Village and
its corporate authorities and officers under this Article and any such
ordinance and any such mortgage or trust deed shall be enforceable by any bond-
holder by mandamus, foreclosure of any such mortgage or trust deed or other
appropriate suit, action or proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction;
provided, that the ordinance or any mortgage or trust deed under which the
bonds are issued may provide that all such remedies and rights to enforcement
may be vested in a trustee for the benefit of all bond-holders, which trustee

outstanding bonds. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-81)
Sec. 9-33. Signatures of officers on bonds; validity of bonds.

be the valid and binding signatures of the officers of the Village
notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof and payments therefor, an or
all of the persons whose signatures appear thereon have ceased to be officers
of the Village issuing such bonds. The validity of the bonds is not dependent
upon nor affected by the validity or regularity of the proceedings relating to
the acquisition, purchase, construction, reconstruction, improvement,
equipping, betterment or extension of the development project for which the
bonds are issued. The ordinance authorizing the bonds may provide that the
bonds shall contain a recital that they are issued pursuant to this Article,
which recital is conclusive evidence of their validity and the regularity of
their issuance. Failure on the part of the applicant or the Village to comply
with the requirements of this Article of the Municipal Code shall not effect
the validity of any industrial revenue bonds issued. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-81)
Sec. 9-34. Lien of bonds.
All bonds issued under this Article shall have a lien upon the revenues and
receipts derived from the development project for which the bonds have been
issued, and the corporate authorities may provide in the ordinance or
ordinances authorizing such bonds for the issuance of additional bonds to be
equally and ratably secured by a lien upon such income or revenues or may
provide that the lien upon such income and revenues is subordinate. (Ord. 0-81-
26, 4-6-81)
Sec. 9-35. Liability for bonds.
No bonds issued under and pursuant to this Article shall be general obligations
payable out of the Village funds, but rather all such bonds shall be limited
obligations payable solely out of the income and revenues derived from the
development project with respect to which such bonds are issued. No holder of
any bonds issued under this Article shall have the right to compel any exercise
of taxing power of the Village to pay the bonds, the interest or premium
thereon, if any. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness of the Village
or a loan of credit thereof within the meaning of any constitutional or
statutory provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond that
it has been issued under the provisions of this Article and that it does not
constitute an indebtedness of the Village or a loan of credit thereof within
the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provisions. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-
81)
Sec. 9-36. Powers conferred as additional and supplemental.
The powers conferred by this Article are in addition and supplemental to, and
the limitations imposed by this Article shall not affect the powers the Village
may have by any law or any other article or chapter. Development projects may
be acquired, purchased, constructed, reconstructed, improved, bettered,
equipped, extended and financed and bonds may be issued under this Article for
such purposes, notwithstanding that any other law or ordinance may likewise
provide for the acquisition, purchase, lease, construction, reconstruction,
improvement, equipping, betterment, extension and financing of a like project,
or the issuance of bonds for such purposes. (Ord. 0-81-26, 4-6-81)

imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground

primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.

intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)

   A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all of the following acts or
privileges:
   (a)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6.0%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event,
shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by
this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in
the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   (b)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6.0%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation
of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any
taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or
municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any
tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the
amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax
properly due and paid in a municipality in this state which was not previously
allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state.
   (c)   The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)
Sec. 9-44. Collection Of Tax By Retailers:
   (a)   The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (b)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)
Sec. 9-45. Returns To Department:
   On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this article on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act 1  and any accompanying rules and regulations
created by the department to implement the act. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)

Sec. 9-46. Resellers:
   (a)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (b)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (c)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-
2010)

interstate telecommunications shall be effective with respect to the gross
charges billed by telecommunications retailers on or after January 1, 2011.

municipal telecommunications tax now imposed by the village at the rate of one
percent (1.0%) with respect to the gross charges billed by telecommunications
retailers with respect to the act or privilege of originating in the
municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate and interstate
telecommunications shall continue in effect until January 1, 2011, provided,
however, that any amounts due or payable to the village for any tax periods
ending prior to January 1, 2011, shall nevertheless remain payable as if this
article had not been adopted. (Ord. 0-10-12, 4-19-2010)

Article 6. Smoke Free Air Regulations
Sec. 12-32. Background:
   Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the
environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that
may result from the incendiary nature of such activity. It has been determined
that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers.
Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered
hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide
and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68 percent of the total smoke produced by a
cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with respiratory
tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative
reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer.
   Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material
and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and property of
residents of the village, it is necessary and desirable to establish
regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in all
enclosed places of employment, near entrances to all such public places and
places of employment, in and near open air public dining areas, and within
certain unenclosed public places including school grounds, parks and recreation
areas and outdoor venues. (Ord. 0-05-51, 12-19-2005, eff. 1-1-2006)
Sec. 12-33. Purpose:
   This article may be cited as the DEERFIELD SMOKE FREE AIR ORDINANCE, the

within twenty five feet (25') of all public entrances to such places, in open
air public dining areas and within twenty five feet (25') of such areas, and
within certain unenclosed public places including school grounds, parks and
recreation areas and outdoor venues in order to ensure that nonsmokers may
breathe air free from the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke. (Ord. 0-05-51,
12-19-2005)

sufficient to compensate the Village both for the direct use of Village
resources and for the effects on Village resources and Village operations
arising from the permitted film production activities. In setting the estimated
film production activity charge, the Village shall use a market- based approach

factors as was done in setting the estimated film production activities
charges. If the final charges are less than the deposit, the Village shall
refund the excess. If the final charges show a balance due from the permittee,
the final fee shall be due and payable in full upon issuance of the final
invoice by the Village. (Ord. 0-13-48, 10-21-2013)

under subsection (a) of this section.

calculations which are acceptable to the village engineer that the discharge
rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater.
   (d)   Storm sewer systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass through the
development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of design frequency
assuming that the land is in a fully developed state under present zoning or
zoning proposed under the village's comprehensive plan. The bypass flow rate
shall be computed utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than thirty five
one-hundredths (0.35). An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate
provided, will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and
release rate has previously been approved by the village and has been
constructed.
   (e)   The live detention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the
basis of the 100-year frequency rainfall, as published by the U.S. weather
bureau for this area. The detention volume required shall be that necessary to
temporarily store the runoff of 100-year rainfall, for any and all durations,
from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less that
volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate.
   (f)   In the event the downstream sewers are inadequate to receive the
release rate hereinabove provided, then the allowable release rate shall be
reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream sewers and
additional detention as determined by the village engineer shall be required to
store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving
sewers.
   (g)   Plans, specifications and calculations for stormwater detention
facilities as required hereunder, shall be submitted to the village engineer
for approval prior to the commencement of construction. (Ord. 0-13-51, 11-4-

the owner's property for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement,
sampling, and testing to determine whether such connection to the public sewer
is in accordance with village standards and all applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations. Where no permission has been granted to enter or
inspect any property, no entry or inspection shall be made without the
procurement of a warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. The court may
consider any of the following factors along with such other matters as it deems
pertinent in its decision as to whether a warrant shall issue:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation.
      (2)   Citizen complaints.

provisions of this chapter, the director of public works and engineering or any
of his authorized agents shall have free access at all reasonable hours,
whether or not a certificate of compliance has been issued, to inspect any
premises connected to a public sanitary sewer for the purposes of determining
whether any drains or outlet pipes serve the premises. The fact that the owner
or occupant of such premises accepts and uses sanitary sewer service provided
by the village shall constitute consent to the making of such inspection. No
person shall refuse to admit authorized agents of the village to any premises
for such purpose. In the event that any authorized representative is refused
admittance or is in any way hindered in the making of the inspection, the
director of public works and engineering or his authorized agents may apply to
any court of competent jurisdiction for an order commanding the owner or
occupant of any premises to permit access for purposes herein described.
   (c)   The provisions of this section shall not limit or deprive the director
of public works and engineering from conducting additional inspections pursuant
to this chapter. If such additional inspections disclose unpermitted

description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice
that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges for
sewer service subsequent to the period covered by the bill.
   (b)   If the user of the sewer service whose bill is unpaid is not the owner
of the premises, and the manager has notice of this, then notice shall be
mailed to the owner of the premises, if his address is known to the manager,
whenever such bill remains unpaid for a period of sixty (60) days after it has
been rendered; provided, however, that the failure of the manager to send such
notice, or of the owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the validity
of the village's lien against the premises. It shall be sufficient service upon
the owner to send such written notice by first class United States mail, with
proper postage prepaid, to the taxpayer of record of the premises on which the
building or excavation is located as listed in the records of the Lake County
treasurer or Cook County treasurer, as the case may be.
   (c)   The village's cost of recording the lien shall be included as part of
the charge for sewer service and shall be paid as a condition of releasing or
discharging said lien. (Ord. 0-13-51, 11-4-2013)
Sec. 16-48. Foreclosure Of Lien Procedures:
   (a)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer service may be foreclosed
and sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be
applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill in equity in
the name of the village.
   (b)   The attorney for the village is hereby authorized and directed to
institute proceedings in the name of the village in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters, against any property for which the sewer
service has remained unpaid for sixty (60) days after it has been rendered.

payment of the whole or any part of the costs thereof by special taxation of
the lots, blocks, tracts, or parcels of land either touching upon the line
where such a sidewalk is constructed, reconstructed or repaired, or located
adjacent to the public right of way across which said sidewalk is constructed,
reconstructed or repaired. This special taxation may be either by levying the
whole or any part of the cost thereof upon each of the lots, blocks, tracts or
parcels of land either touching upon the line of the sidewalk or adjacent to
the public right of way across which said sidewalk is constructed or
reconstructed, prorata, according to their respective values. The values of the

their superficial area, as may be provided by the ordinance ordering the
construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk. In the event that the
ordinance requires only a portion of the cost of the sidewalk construction,

residue of the cost shall be paid out of any fund of the Village raised by
general taxation upon the property in the Village, or from other revenues
obtained by the Village and not otherwise appropriated. The Village, by the

and may provide that the materials and construction shall be under the
supervision of and be subject to the approval of the Village Engineer or of
such other officer or board of officers of the Village as may be designated in
the ordinance. The ordinance shall require all owners of lots, blocks, tracts
or parcels of land touching upon the line of the proposed sidewalk or portions
of sidewalk, or situated adjacent to the public right of way across which such
sidewalk or portions of sidewalk are to be constructed, reconstructed or
repaired, to construct, reconstruct or repair such sidewalk in front of,
adjacent to or touching upon their respective lots, blocks, tracts or parcels
of land in accordance with the specifications of the ordinance, within thirty
(30) days after the mailing of notice of the passage of such ordinance
addressed to the party who last paid the general taxes on the respective lots,
blocks, tracts or parcels. Upon the failure or default thereof of said owners
to construct or repair such sidewalk or portions thereof in accordance with the
ordinance, the Village may furnish the materials and construct, reconstruct or
repair the sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance, or may enter into a
contract for the furnishing of such materials and the construction,
reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk or portions of sidewalk as hereinafter
provided in this Article. Provided that no such sidewalk repair or
reconstruction shall be undertaken by the Village with respect to this Article
until such time as said owners of lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land as
defined herein are first given an opportunity to participate in a voluntary
sidewalk repair program provided for in Article 5 of Chapter 19 of this Code.
The cost of sidewalk construction, reconstruction or repair, or such part
thereof as may be fixed in the ordinance, may be collected as hereinafter
provided in this Article, and the Village may issue vouchers bearing not to
exceed six percent (6%) interest annually in payment of these sidewalks or
portions thereof, payable solely out of the special tax provided for in this
Article, when such tax is collected.

engineering and supervision thereof, together with an additional sum, not to
exceed six percent (6%) of the amount of said cost of construction, engineering
and supervision, to be applied toward the payment of the costs of preparing a
special tax list, levying and collecting said special tax as provided for in
this Article, and an additional amount not to exceed six percent (6%) of the
cost of construction, engineering and supervision, to be applied as a reserve
for deficiency in interest, shall be made by the Village Engineer or by such
other officer or board as is designated by the ordinance to take charge of the
construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk, or portions thereof,
together with a list of the lots, blocks tracts or parcels of land touching
upon the line of the sidewalk or adjacent to the public right of way whereon
such sidewalk or portion thereof is located, and the names of the parties who
last paid the general taxes on the respective lots, blocks, tracts or parcels
and the frontage, superficial area, or assessed value as specified in this
Article, according to the provisions of such ordinance in providing for the
levy of the cost by such frontage, superficial area or assessed value.
Thereupon, if the owner of any lot, block, tract or parcel of land has failed
or refused to construct, reconstruct or repair his portion of the sidewalk in
accordance with the provisions of the ordinance, the Village Engineer or other
specified officer or board shall proceed to prepare a special tax list against
those lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land in front of, or adjacent to, or
touching upon the sidewalk or the public right of way whereon the sidewalk is
located which is the subject of such construction, reconstruction or repair,
ascertaining by computation the amount of special taxes and the annual
installments thereof to be charged against each of such lots, blocks, tracts or
parcels of land on account of the construction, reconstruction or repair of the
sidewalk, according to the rule fixed for the levy of that special tax by the
ordinance. The aggregate amount of each special tax levied against the lots,
blocks, tracts or parcels of land provided for herein shall be divided into
five (5) annual installments of equal amounts, except that all fractional
amounts shall be added to the first installment, so as to leave the remaining
installments equal in amounts and each a multiple of one hundred dollars
($100.00). This special tax list shall be filed in the office of the Village
Engineer or of such other specified officer or board, which officer or board
shall thereupon issue warrants directed to the Village Collector, or to such
officer as may be so designated in the ordinance, for the collection of the
amount of special tax so ascertained and appearing from this special tax list
to be due from the respective lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land. The
first installment shall be due and payable on the second day of January next
after the date of the issuance of the first voucher on account of the work
done, and the second installment shall be due and payable one year thereafter,
and so on annually until all installments are paid. The specified officer or
board shall prepare, execute and file in the office of the Village Collector or
such other officer that may be designated to collect the tax, a certificate of
the date of issuance of the first voucher and of the amount thereof, which
certificate shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the first voucher is
so issued.
Sec. 19-49. Report of Unpaid Special Tax.
Upon failure to collect the special tax as hereinbefore provided in this
Article, the Village Collector, or the officer designated to collect the tax on
or before the first day of August in each year, shall make a written report of
this special tax for the purpose of applying for judgment against and the
selling of lands for such taxes due the Village. This report shall also contain
an enumeration of (1) all the lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land upon
which this special tax remains unpaid, (2) the names of the respective owners
thereof, so far as the names are known to the collecting officer, (3) the
amount due and unpaid upon each lot, block, tract or parcel; and (4) a copy of
the ordinance ordering the construction, reconstruction of repair of the
sidewalk. This report shall be accompanied by the oath of the officer that the
list is a correct return of the lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land on
which the special tax levied by authority of the Village for the cost or
partial cost, as the case may be, of the sidewalk specified in that ordinance
remains due and unpaid, and that the amounts therein stated as due and unpaid,
have not been collected, nor any part thereof. This report, when so made, is
prima facie evidence that all the forms and requirements of the law in relation
to making that return have been complied with, and that the special tax, as
mentioned in the report is due and unpaid.
Sec. 19-50. Judgment and Sale.
When the Village Collector completes such a report, he shall at once proceed to
obtain judgment against the lots, blocks, tracts or parcels of land enumerated
therein for the special tax remaining due and unpaid, in the same manner as may
be provided by law for obtaining judgment against land for taxes due and unpaid
to the county and State, and in the same manner shall proceed to sell the same
for the special tax due and unpaid. In obtaining this judgment, and making this
sale, the said officer shall be governed by the general revenue laws of the
State of Illinois, except when otherwise provided in this Article. The general
revenue laws shall also apply to the execution of certificates of sales and
deeds, and to the force and effect of these sales and deeds. All other laws in
relation to the enforcement and collection of taxes, and redemption from tax
sales, shall apply to proceedings to collect this special tax, except as
otherwise provided in this Article.
Sec. 19-51. Construction by Owner; Order for Reimbursement.
Whenever payment of the cost of such sidewalk is required to be made in part by
special tax and in part out of any general fund or other revenues of the
Village, and the owner of a lot, block, tract or parcel of land constructs,
reconstructs or repairs the sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance for its
construction, reconstruction or repair, the officer or board directed by the
ordinance to superintend the construction or repair thereof shall thereupon
have issued to that owner, an order on the Village Treasurer for the owner's
cost of the construction, reconstruction or repair of the sidewalk, as a credit
against the amount of special tax chargeable to the lot, block, tract or parcel
of land of that owner.
Sec. 19-52. Bids.

provided in this Article, when the expense thereof exceeds one thousand five
hundred dollars ($1,500.00) shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder in

and certified by a responsible bank, for an amount which shall not be less than
ten percent (10%) of the aggregate of the bid. All contracts shall be approved
by the officer of the board, having the supervision of the construction,
reconstruction or repair of that sidewalk. (Ord. 0-76-47, 8-16-1976)
Sec. 19-53. New Tax And Ordinance When Special Tax Is Set Aside:
   If a special tax for the construction, reconstruction or repair of a
sidewalk or portion thereof is annulled by the corporate authorities or set
aside by any court due to the prior ordinance being defective, but not void, a
new ordinance may be passed and a new tax may be made and returned. The
proceedings therefor shall be in all respects the same as in the first
instance, provided that no special tax shall be levied for sidewalk
construction, reconstruction or repair work already done under a prior
ordinance, unless such work was accomplished by the village in good faith under
a contract duly let and executed pursuant to such ordinance providing that the
cost of such sidewalk should be paid for by special taxation in accordance with
this article. (Ord. 0-76-47, 8-16-1976)

license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (A)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (B)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (C)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Workers' compensation with statutory limits;
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident; and
      (5)   Property insurance for its property replacement cost against all
risks.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (b)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (c)   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the Village within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village. In lieu of a copy of
the policy, a certificate indicating that the insurance policies required by
this section have been obtained and are in force, may be submitted with the
approval of the Director of Public Works and Engineering.
   (d)   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until ten (10) days after receipt by the
Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not
to renew.
   Within seven (7) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and in no
event later than three (3) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (e)   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self- insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (a) of this section, or the requirements of
subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-
insure shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements
required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the
utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
   (f)   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. (Ord. 0-18-25, 7-
16-2018)
Sec. 19-72. Indemnification:
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of- way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees, and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from
or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of- way, and in providing
or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this article or by a franchise, license,
or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity
obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands,
judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or resulting from the
negligence, misconduct or breach of this article by the Village, its officials,
officers, employees, agents or representatives. A utility shall also waive any
claims it may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability. (Ord. 0-18-25, 7-16-2018)
Sec. 19-73. Security:
   (a)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this article or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, or
DuPage Counties, Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection for any single phase.
   (d)   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (e)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection (c) of this section.
   (f)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (c) of this section.
   (g)   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 0-18-25, 7-
16-2018)
Sec. 19-74. Permit Suspension And Revocation:

of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current Federal regulations (49 CFR 192.707).
   (d)   Facilities To Be Located Within Particular Rights-Of-Way: The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way (a
public utility easement, for example) that are not highways, rather than within
particular highways.
   (e)   Freestanding Facilities:
      (1)   The Village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   All freestanding facilities located within a right-of-way shall be
located underground to the greatest extent possible, as determined by the
Village Engineer, and to the extent that the Village Engineer determines that
it is not technically possible to install any such facilities underground, such
facilities shall be substantially screened from view by landscaping pursuant to

      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (A)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (B)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the roadway
structure in the transportation system;
         (C)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (D)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (E)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (F)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;

   (b)   In lieu thereof, the person charged with such removal may request that
the same be done by the Village. The cost of such tree removal shall be borne
by the owner, and if the Village shall remove any such diseased tree or
breeding place, either at the owner's request or as a result of the owner's
failure, refusal or neglect to accomplish tree removal action, then the cost
incurred in such diseased tree or breeding place removal shall also become a
lien upon the real estate affected until paid, superior to all other liens and
encumbrances, except tax liens; provided that notice has been given as
hereinabove described, and further provided that within sixty (60) days after
such cost and expense is incurred, the Village Manager, on behalf of the
Village, files notice of lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in the
county in which such real estate is located or in the office of the Registrar
of Titles of such county if the real estate affected is registered under the
Torrens system.
   (c)   Such notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out (1) a
description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof, (2) the
amount of money representing the cost and expense incurred or payable for the
service, and (3) the date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by
the Village. However, the lien of such Village shall not be valid as to any
purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate have arisen subsequent to the
tree removal and prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of such
Village shall not be valid as to any mortgagee, judgment creditor or other
lienor whose rights in and to such real estate arise prior to the filing of
such notice. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of or persons
interested in such property after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall
be released by the Village and the release may be filed of record as in the

by the use of acceptable tree protection measures in accordance with a tree
preservation plan approved by the village forester.
   (c)   For purposes of this section, "acceptable tree protection measures"
are those measures designed and implemented to reasonably limit the damage to
such protected trees while enabling lawful construction activity consistent
with best construction practices as determined by the village. Acceptable tree
protection measures include:
      (1)   The installation of tree protection fencing along the perimeter of
the critical root zone located within the construction site, which shall remain
in place during construction and removed only when construction is complete or
as authorized by the village forester. The fencing shall be wood slat fencing,
or such other fencing as approved by the village forester. The proposed
location of tree protection fencing shall be shown on the demolition plan, lot
redevelopment plan, or lot improvement plan. Tree protection fencing shall be
placed along the perimeter of the critical root zone of each tree to the extent
practical. Such fencing shall be contained within the limits of the site and
within the limits of the adjacent public parkway. Such fencing shall not
encroach on to public streets or sidewalks.
      (2)   The installation of security fencing for the site as provided in
section
6-71 of this code, which shall remain in place during construction and removed
only when construction is complete or as authorized by the village forester.
      (3)   Tree protection measures recommended by a professional arborist and
approved by the village forester to reasonably involve the least amount of
damage to protected trees.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as effectively prohibiting
otherwise lawful construction that conforms to the zoning ordinance and
building codes of the village. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-31. Action On Applications For Ad Hoc Tree Removal:
   (a)   Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this article, it shall be
unlawful for any owner without a tree removal permit from the village to damage
or remove any public tree or any protected tree.
   (b)   Any owner that damages or removes, or authorizes anyone to damage or
remove, any protected tree located on such owner's land, or any protected tree
located on adjacent property and within ten feet (10') of a lot line shared
with the owner's land or that has a critical root zone extending onto the
owner's land, shall also be responsible for the damage or removal of such
protected tree, notwithstanding that the damage or removal was performed or
caused by another person acting under the authority of such owner.
   (c)   An owner that seeks to remove a public tree, a heritage tree, or a
protected tree on a site must complete a tree removal permit application and
shall be required to submit the application fee established in the village fee
ordinance and, if applicable, the mitigation fee required by this article;
provided, however, that no tree removal application fee, permit fee or
mitigation fee shall be required if an application is approved for removal of a
protected tree for the following reasons:
      (1)   The protected tree must be removed because it is dead, dying or
diseased.
      (2)   The protected tree is weakened by disease, age, fire, storm or
other natural causes such that it is likely to die or become diseased.
      (3)   The protected tree constitutes a hazard to pedestrian or vehicular
traffic.
      (4)   The protected tree constitutes a hazard to a building.
      (5)   Removal of the protected tree is consistent with good forestry
practices.
      (6)   The protected tree is causing or is likely to cause a public
nuisance as a result of root invasion into public utility lines or private
utility services on the owner's property.
   (d)   Upon receipt of the owner's application, the village forester shall
visit and inspect the owner's property and contiguous and adjoining lots in
order to evaluate the application. Subject to compliance with other applicable
provisions of this code, the village forester shall approve the application and
issue a tree removal permit subject to such conditions as may be required for
the preservation of protected trees and/or for mitigation of necessary removal
of protected trees.
   (e)   Prior to the removal of any protected tree authorized for removal, the
tree shall be clearly marked by the village forester. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005;
amd. Ord. 0-21-10, 3-15-2021)
Sec. 21-32. Permit Revocation And Expiration:
   (a)   An owner receiving an ad hoc tree removal permit shall have a duty to
remove the trees identified in such permit within ninety (90) days after the
date of the tree removal permit. An owner receiving a tree removal permit shall
be authorized to remove the tree(s) identified in such permit in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the tree removal permit application
as approved by the village forester.
   (b)   Any permit issued by the village for demolition, lot development or
lot improvement as provided in this article is subject to stop work order,
suspension or revocation by the director if the permit holder violates the
terms of the permit or any other provision of this article.
   (c)   Any building permit issued for a single-family residence expires one
year from the date of issuance thereof and no construction, alteration or
removal shall take place after such expiration. A building permit may be
extended for a period not exceeding six (6) months only upon the approval of
the director of building and zoning and only in the event that the plans for
construction comply with all aspects of this code and all other ordinances in
effect at said time. If granted, such an extension shall also extend the
demolition, lot development or lot improvement permit issued under this article
for a like period of time. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-33. Mitigation Required For The Removal Of Protected Trees:
   (a)   An owner receiving a permit for the removal of public trees or
protected trees on the subject property shall have a duty to provide mitigation
of the protected trees as specified in the tree removal permit issued by the
village.
   (b)   An owner that removes a public tree or a protected tree without a tree
removal permit or in violation of a tree removal permit shall provide
mitigation of such tree(s) in accordance with a tree replacement plan approved
by the village forester.
   (c)   An owner that has damaged a public tree such that the tree is dying or
diseased or is likely to die or become diseased shall replace such tree(s) in
accordance with a tree replacement plan approved by the village forester.
   (d)   An owner that has damaged a protected tree such that the tree is dying
or diseased or is likely to die or become diseased shall provide mitigation of
such tree(s) in accordance with a tree replacement plan approved by the village
forester.
   (e)   The removal of protected trees and public trees requires mitigation as
determined by the village forester. Protected trees and public trees shall be
mitigated by either planting replacement trees or by payment of a mitigation
fee at the rate specified in the annual fee ordinance, considering the size,
condition rating and species rating of the trees requiring mitigation. The
village forester shall determine the replacement rate for protected trees and
public trees requiring mitigation pursuant to the following formula utilizing
the species rating guide set forth in appendix E to the "Administrative
Manual", and the tree condition and rating guide set forth as appendix D of the
"Administrative Manual" which are adopted and incorporated herein by this
reference.
 
             Replacement Rate
Species Group DBH Removed Number Caliper Inches Replaced
A             1 inch      1.0 inch caliper
B             1 inch      0.6 inch caliper
C             1 inch      0.3 inch caliper
 
   (f)   The removal of a healthy heritage tree requires full mitigation as
determined by the Village Forester. Heritage trees shall be mitigated without
the consideration of replacement rates. Mitigation value shall depend on the
DBH of the tree, regardless of the species rating or condition rating of the
healthy heritage tree. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005; amd. Ord. 0-21-10, 3-15-2021)
Sec. 21-34. Mitigation Credit For The Elimination Of Rhamnus (Buckthorn):
   An owner that removes trees in a manner that requires mitigation pursuant to
this article, and as part of the removal eliminates an invasive species of
Rhamnus (Buckthorn) on the subject property shall be entitled to a credit
determined by the Village Forester to offset, in whole or in part, any
mitigation fees based on the about of Rhamnus (Buckthorn) eliminated from the
property. (Ord. 0-21-10, 3-15-2021)
Sec. 21-35. Tree Replacement Plans:
   (a)   When required by this article, a tree replacement plan shall be
submitted providing for the planting of new trees of species, caliper and at
locations approved by the village forester and for a program of watering and
maintenance to ensure that the new plantings will become established for the
replacement of protected trees and/or public trees removed or damaged by the
owner. If a tree replacement plan calls for the planting of six (6) or more
replacement trees, no more than one third (1/3) of the replacement trees shall
be of a single species to prevent a monoculture.
   (b)   Any owner required to make replacements for a protected tree shall
make all such replacements with a new tree or saplings of not less than two
inches (2") caliper or eight feet (8') in height when deciduous ornamental
trees in clump form or evergreens are used (an 8 foot tree is considered
equivalent to a 3 inch caliper tree). The total aggregate caliper of all such
trees and/or saplings used as replacements based on good forestry practices as
approved by the village forester shall equal or exceed the DBH of the protected
tree(s) so removed.
   (c)   A cash tree replacement fee shall be submitted with the tree
replacement plan as a guarantee that protected trees will be replaced pursuant
to the plan. The total fee shall be the replacement cost per inch at breast
height as established in the village fee ordinance times the replacement rate
specified in section
21-33 of this article.
   (d)   Replacement of protected trees shall be made within twelve (12) months
of the date of issuance of the tree removal permit. The village forester upon
request may grant an extension of not more than twelve (12) months' time. Upon
the planting of the mitigation trees and after the inspection and approval of
the mitigation trees by the village forester, the amount of cash tree
replacement fee guarantee equal to the number of inches planted will be
refunded to the applicant. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005; amd. Ord. 0-21-10, 3-15-
2021)
Sec. 21-36. Inspections:
   A copy of the tree removal permit or approved tree preservation plan shall
be kept at the site during the time that work is underway, and the village
forester shall make whatever inspections are required to ensure compliance. The
director is authorized to issue a stop work order for all construction work on
the site if the owner fails to comply with the requirements of tree removal
permit or tree preservation plan. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-37. Tree Emergencies:
   (a)   If a tree emergency shall occur such that there arises a risk of
imminent danger or hazard to persons or property from any protected tree which
ought to be cut or removed immediately or with as little delay as possible
(e.g., protected trees which threaten to fall or have fallen on houses or power
lines or impede safe passage of streets or have become uprooted or unstable as
a result of severe weather, floods or high winds), then it shall be lawful for
the owner to remove such protected tree to the extent necessary to avoid
immediate danger or hazard without a tree removal permit provided that within
fourteen (14) days after taking any such action the owner shall submit an after
the fact tree removal permit application describing the tree emergency and the
actions taken.
   (b)   If the village forester upon his review of the tree removal permit
application concurs that a tree emergency existed and that the owner's actions
were warranted in response to the tree emergency, an after the fact tree
removal permit shall be issued without fee and no further action under these
regulations shall be necessary. If the village forester determines that no
genuine tree emergency existed to justify the cutting or removal of the
protected tree(s), then such actions by the owner shall be deemed a violation
of these regulations and the owner shall be required to provide mitigation as
provided in section
21-28 of this article. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-38. Penalty:
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this article shall be punished by
a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and not more than one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) for each such violation. A separate
and distinct violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each protected tree
or public tree unlawfully damaged, removed and/or not replaced in violation of
this article, and a separate and distinct violation shall be deemed to have
occurred for each day that such violation exists or continues. Any penalties
imposed are in addition to any required mitigation. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-39. Fees:
   Fees for tree removal permit applications, tree removal permits, and plan
reviews shall be paid as provided in the village fee ordinance. (Ord. 0-05-9,
3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-40. Appeals:
   Except as otherwise provided in this article, an applicant may appeal in
writing to the village manager any decision made by the director or village
forester within thirty (30) days of the decision being rendered. If not
satisfied with the decision of the village manager, the applicant may appeal in
writing to the village board of trustees within thirty (30) days of the
decision rendered by the village manager, but the board of trustees is not
obliged to consider any such appeal. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-21-2005)
Sec. 21-41. Nonliability Of Village:
   Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the
village or upon any of its officers or employees nor to relieve the owner of
any private property from the duty to keep trees and shrubs upon private
property or under his control in a safe and healthy condition. (Ord. 0-05-9, 3-
21-2005)
Sec. 21-42.   Requirements For Contracted Tree Maintenance:
   (a)   Requirements for Contracted Tree Maintenance, Skill requirements or
certifications for individuals or organizations managing or performing work on
trees for Village are required. Requirements include having a certified
arborist supervising the work. Specialized or advanced certifications such as
the ISA's Municipal specialist, Tree Worker Climber, Aerial Lift, Board
Certified Master Arborist Specialists, Tree Risk Assessment Qualifications,
etc. or Tree Care Industry accreditation may be required for specific actions.
   (b)   Nursery Stock Standards, Trees purchased by the Village of Deerfield
shall be of a quality consistent with the most current American Standards for

vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time such signal is

turn right after stopping as required by paragraph (c) 1 of this Section but
shall yield the right-of- way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Intersections

pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal shall comply with the meaning of the
circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or straight-through arrow indication
as if it were shown alone, unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian signal as

where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated

the person be arrested are inapplicable, but the officer shall issue the person
a uniform traffic ticket for an offense as defined in Section 22-19 prior to
requesting that the person submit to the test or tests. The issuance of the
uniform traffic ticket shall not constitute an arrest, but shall be for the
purpose of notifying the person that he or she is subject to the provisions of
this Section and of the officer's belief of the existence of a probable cause
to arrest. Upon returning to this State, the officer shall file the uniform
traffic ticket with the circuit clerk of the county where the offense was
committed, and shall seek the issuance of an arrest warrant or a summons for
the person.
   (b)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section and the test
or tests may be administered subject to the provisions of Section
22-19.2.
   (c)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be
warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to
submit to the test will result in statutory summary suspension of the person's
privilege to operate a motor vehicle as provided in 625 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/6-208.1. The person shall also be warned by the law enforcement
officer that if the person submits to the test or tests provided in subsection
(a) of this Section and the alcohol concentration in the person's blood or
breath is 0.10 or greater, or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound
resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as covered by the
Cannabis Control Act 1  or a controlled substance listed in the Illinois
Controlled Substances Act 2  is detected in the person's blood or urine, a
statutory summary suspension of the person's privilege to operate a motor
vehicle, as provided in 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/6-208.1 and this
Section, will be imposed.
   (d)   If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an
alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance or
compound in the person's blood or urine resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act 3  or a controlled
substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act 4 , the law
enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit
court of venue and the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests
was or were requested under subsection (a) of this Section and the person
refused to submit to a test, or tests, or submitted to testing that disclosed
an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more.
   (e)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer
submitted under subsection (d) above, the Secretary of State shall enter the
statutory summary suspension for the periods specified in 625 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/6-208.1, and effective as provided in subsection (g) of this
Section.
   If the person is a first offender as defined in Section
22-19.4 of this Code, and is not convicted of a violation of Section
22-19 of this Code, then reports received by the Secretary of State under this
Section shall, except during the actual time the statutory summary suspension
is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police
officers, prosecuting authorities or the Secretary of State.
   (f)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under
subsection (d) of this Section shall serve immediate notice of the statutory
summary suspension on the person and the suspension shall be effective as
provided in subsection (g) of this Section. In cases where the blood alcohol
concentration of 0.10 or greater or any amount of a drug, substance or compound
resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as covered by the
Cannabis Control Act or a controlled substance listed in the Illinois
Controlled Substances Act is established by a subsequent analysis of blood or
urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice
as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of the
notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his
address as shown on the uniform traffic ticket and the statutory summary
suspension shall begin as provided in subsection (g) of this Section. The
officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver's license or permit on the person
at the time of arrest. If the person has a valid driver's license or permit,
the officer shall issue the person a receipt, in a form prescribed by the
Secretary of State, that will allow that person to drive during the periods
provided for in subsection (g) of this Section. The officer shall immediately
forward the driver's license or permit to the circuit court of venue along with
the sworn report provided for in subsection (d) of this Section.
   (g)   The statutory summary suspension referred to in this Section shall
take effect on the forty sixth day following the date the notice of the
statutory summary suspension was given to the person.
   (h)   The following procedure shall apply whenever a person is arrested for
any offense as defined in Section
22-19.
   Upon receipt of the sworn report from the law enforcement officer, the
Secretary of State shall confirm the statutory summary suspension by mailing a
notice of the effective date of the suspension to the person and the court of
venue. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing
sufficient information or be completed in error, the confirmation of the
statutory summary suspension shall not be mailed to the person or entered to
the record, instead the sworn report shall be forwarded to the court of venue
with a copy returned to the issuing agency identifying any defect. (Ord. 0-82-
01, 1-4-82; amd. Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

Sec. 22-19.2. Chemical and other tests.
   (a)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of an arrest for an offense, as defined in Section
22-19 herein, evidence of the concentration of alcohol, other drug or
combination thereof in a person's blood or breath at the time alleged, as
determined by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath or other bodily
substance,shall be submitted to the court for admission. Where such test is
made the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Chemical analyses of the person's blood, urine, breath or other
bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section
shall be performed according to regulations and standards promulgated by the
Illinois Department of Public Health in consultation with the Illinois
Department of Law Enforcement by an individual possessing a valid permit issued
by that Department for this purpose. The Director of the Department of Public
Health in consultation with the Department of State Police is authorized to
approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and
competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to issue permits which
shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of that
Department and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The
Illinois Department of Public Health shall prescribe regulations as necessary
to implement this Section.
      (2)   When a person shall submit to a blood test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under the provisions of Section
22-19.1 herein, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a registered
nurse or other qualified person approved by the Illinois Department of Public
Health may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug or
alcohol and drug content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking
of breath or urine specimens. When a blood test of a person who has been taken
to an adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law
enforcement officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician authorized
to practice medicine in the adjoining state, a registered nurse, or a trained
phlebotomist acting under the direction of the physician. The law enforcement
officer requesting the test shall take custody of the blood sample, and the
blood sample shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Department of
Public Health for that purpose.
      (3)   The person tested may have a physician or a qualified technician,
chemist, registered nurse or other qualified person of their own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the
direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence
relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement
officer.
      (4)   Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a chemical test
or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information
concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or such
person's attorney.
      (5)   Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per one
hundred (100) milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
(210) liters of breath. (Ord. 0-82-01, 1-4-82; amd. Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)
Sec. 22-19.3. Penalty.
   (a)   Except as provided under subsection (b) of this Section, every person

Every person convicted a second time for violating Section
22-19 within five (5) years of a previous violation of that Section
22-19 shall be subject to an additional mandatory minimum fine of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and an additional ten days of mandatory community service in
a program benefiting children if the current offense was committed while
transporting a person sixteen (16) years of age or younger. The imprisonment or
assignment under this Section shall not be subject to suspension nor shall the
person be eligible for probation in order to reduce the sentence or assignment.
   (b)   After a finding of guilt and prior to any final sentencing, or an
order for supervision, for an offense based upon an arrest for a violation of
Section
22-19, individuals shall be required to undergo a professional evaluation to
determine if an alcohol or other drug abuse problem exists and the extent of
the problem. Programs conducting these evaluations shall be licensed by the
Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse. The cost of any professional
evaluation shall be paid for by the individual required to undergo the
professional evaluation.
   (c)   Every person found guilty of violating Section
22-19, whose operation of a motor vehicle while in violation of Section
22-19 proximately caused an incident resulting in an appropriate emergency
response, shall be liable for the expense of an emergency response as provided
in 730 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5-5-3.
   (d)   The Secretary of State shall revoke the driving privileges of any
person convicted under Section
22-19. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)
Sec. 22-19.4. Definitions.

the cause of action is the same or substantially similar to this Article 5 or
any person who has not had a driver's license suspension for violating Section
22-19.1  within five (5) years prior to the date of the current offense, except
in cases where the driver submitted to chemical testing resulting in an alcohol
concentration of 0.10 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound
in such person's blood or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption
of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act 8  or a controlled substance

blood alcohol tests conducted upon persons receiving medical treatment in a
hospital emergency room are admissible in evidence of a business record
exception to the hearsay rule only in prosecutions for any violation of Section
22-19 of this Code, or in prosecutions for reckless homicide brought under 720
Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-1 et seq., when each of the following criteria
are met:
      (1)   The blood alcohol tests were ordered by a physician on duty at the
hospital emergency room and were performed in the regular course of providing
emergency medical treatment in order to assist the physician in diagnosis or
treatment;
      (2)   The blood alcohol tests were performed by the hospital's own
laboratory; and
      (3)   The written results of the blood alcohol tests were received and
considered by the physician on duty at the hospital emergency room to assist
that physician in diagnosis or treatment.
   (b)   The confidentiality provisions of law pertaining to medical records
and medical treatment shall not be applicable with regard to blood alcohol
tests performed under the provisions of this Section in prosecutions as
specified in subsection (a) of this Section. No person shall be liable for
civil damages as a result of the evidentiary use of blood alcohol test results
under this Section, or as a result of that person's testimony made available
under this Section. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)
Sec. 22-19.6. Preliminary breath screen test.
   If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person is
violating or has violated Section
22-19, the officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to provide a
sample of his or her breath for a preliminary breath screening test using a
portable device approved by the Department of Public Health. The results of
this preliminary breath screening test may be used by the law enforcement
officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to
require a chemical test as authorized under Sections
22-19.1 and
22-19.2 and the appropriate type of test to request. Any chemical test
authorized under Sections
22-19.1 and
22-19.2 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result of the
preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The
result of a preliminary breath screening test may be used by the defendant as
evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving a violation of
Sections
22-19 or
22-19.1. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)
Sec. 22-19.7. Driver involvement in personal injury or fatal motor vehicle
accident;chemical test.
   (a)   Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor vehicle upon
the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to a
breath test using a portable device as approved by the Department of Public
Health or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol or other drug content of such person's blood if
there is probable cause to believe that such person was the driver at fault, in
whole or in part, for a motor vehicle accident which resulted in the death or
personal injury of any person. Compliance with this Section does not relieve
such person from the requirements of Section
22-19.1 of this Code.
   (b)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section. In addition,
if a driver of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor
vehicle accident, any physician licensed to practice medicine, registered nurse
or a phlebotomist acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall
withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol or
other drugs, upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However,
no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion of the medical
personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or
endangering the well-being of the patient.
   (c)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be
warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to
submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol
concentration of 0.10 or more may result in the suspension of such person's
privilege to operate a motor vehicle.
   (d)   If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an
alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, the law enforcement officer shall
immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form
prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested
pursuant to subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests
or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or
more.
   (e)   The results of any test or tests administered pursuant to this
Section, other than a test conducted with a portable device, may be used in a
civil or criminal action. Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or
proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person
while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the
influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or
breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine,
breath or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
      (1)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less,
it shall presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
      (2)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of
0.05 but less than 0.10, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that
the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was
under the influence of alcohol.
      (3)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more,
it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
      (4)   The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the
question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (f)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions
of this Section, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or
criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor
vehicle.
   (g)   For the purposes of this Section, a personal injury shall include any
injury that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor's
office or a medical facility. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

of the offense, or a person adjudicated delinquent pursuant to 705 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 405/1-1 et seq., for violation of Section
22-19 of this Code, the court may order the offender to participate in the
Youthful Intoxicated Drivers' Visitation Program. The Program shall consist of
a supervised visitation as provided by this Section by the person to at least
one of the following, to the extent that personnel and facilities are

of the offender to pay the costs of the Program. The court may waive the
requirement that the offender pay the costs of participation in the Program
upon a finding of indigence.
   (c)   As used in this Section, "appropriate victims" means victims whose
condition is determined by the visit supervisor to demonstrate the results of
motor vehicle accidents involving persons under the influence of alcohol
without being excessively gruesome or traumatic to the observer.
   (d)   Any visitation shall include, before any observation of victims or
disabled persons, a comprehensive counseling session with the visitation
supervisor at which the supervisor shall explain and discuss the experiences
which may be encountered during the visitation in order to ascertain whether
the visitation is appropriate. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

is being used for purposes for which a limousine is ordinarily used, the
passengers on a chartered bus when it is being used for purposes for which
chartered buses are ordinarily used or on a motor home or mini motor home as
defined in chapter 625 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. However, the driver
of any such vehicle is prohibited form consuming or having any alcoholic liquor
in or about the driver's area. Any evidence of alcoholic consumption by the
driver shall be prima facie evidence of such driver's failure to obey this
Section. For the purposes of this Section, a limousine is a motor vehicle of
the first division with the passenger compartment enclosed by a partition or
dividing window used in the for-hire transportation of passengers and operated
by an individual in possession of a valid Illinois driver's license of the
appropriate classification pursuant to chapter 625 of the Illinois Compiled
Statutes.
   (d)   The exemption applicable to chartered buses under subsection (c) does
not apply to any chartered bus being used for school purposes.
   (e)   Any driver who is convicted of violating subsection (a) of this
Section for a second or subsequent time within one year of a similar conviction
shall be subject to suspension of driving privileges as provided in chapter 625
of the Illinois Compiled Statutes. (Ord. 0-94-01, 1-3-94)

or more individuals competing or racing on any street or highway in this
Village in a situation in which one of the motor vehicles is beside or to the
rear of a motor vehicle operated by a competing driver and the one driver
attempts to prevent the competing driver from passing or overtaking him, either
by acceleration or maneuver, or one or more individuals competing in a race
against time on any street or highway in this Village. (M.C. 1963, § 20.343)
Article 6. Speed Restrictions.
Sec. 22-24. General speed restrictions.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful to drive any motor vehicle on any street not
under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, State of Illinois,
or Lake or Cook County, in an urban district within the Village at a speed in

established are set forth in Exhibit A.
Provided further that the speed of all vehicles, of the second division, as
defined by statute, having two (2) or more solid tires shall not exceed ten
(10) miles per hour within any urban district in the Village.
   (b)   The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable
maximum speed limits does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease
speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going
around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow
or winding roadway or when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or
other traffic by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speed shall be

cane or walking stick which is white in color or white tipped with red, or who
is being guided by a dog, shall have the right-of-way in crossing any street or
highway, whether or not traffic on such street or highway is controlled by
traffic signals, anything in this Chapter to the contrary notwithstanding. The
driver of every vehicle approaching the place where a blind person, so carrying
such a cane or walking or being so guided, is crossing a street or highway
shall bring his vehicle to a full stop and before proceeding shall take such
precautions as may be necessary to avoid injury to the blind person.
   (b)   The provisions of this Section shall not apply to a blind person who
is not carrying such a cane or walking stick or is not guided by a dog, but the
other provisions of this Chapter relating to pedestrians shall be applicable to
such person. However, the failure of a blind person to so use or so carry such
a cane or walking stick or to be guided by a guide dog when walking on streets,
highways or sidewalks shall be considered evidence of contributory negligence.

   (a)   No pedestrian shall enter or remain upon any bridge or approach
thereto beyond the bridge, signal, gate or barrier after a bridge operation
signal indication has been given.

gate or barrier at a railroad grade crossing or bridge while such gate or
barrier is closed or being opened or closed.
   (c)   No pedestrian shall enter, remain upon or traverse over a railroad
grade crossing or pedestrian walkway crossing a railroad track when an audible

giving warning of the approach of a railroad train.
   (d)   A violation of any part of this Section shall result in a mandatory
fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or fifty (50) hours of community
service. (Ord. 0-96-08, 3-4-1996)
Sec. 22-61. Obedience To Signal Indicating Approach Of Train:
   (a)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing such person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a
railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the
circumstances stated in this Section, the driver shall stop within fifty feet
(50') but not less than fifteen feet (15') from the nearest rail of the
railroad and shall not proceed until he can do so safely. The foregoing
requirements shall apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train;
      (3)   A railroad train approaching a highway crossing emits a warning
signal and such railroad train, by reason of its speed or nearness to such
crossing, is an immediate hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train is plainly visible and is in
hazardous proximity to such crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train is approaching so closely that an immediate hazard
is created.
   (b)   No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any
crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or barrier is
closed or is being opened or closed.
   (c)   The Village with approval of the Department of Transportation may
designate particularly dangerous highway grade crossings of railroads and erect
stop signs thereat. When such stop signs are erected, the driver of any vehicle
shall stop within fifty feet (50') but not less than fifteen feet (15') from
the nearest rail of such railroad and shall proceed only upon exercising due
care.
   (d)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with the railroad crossbuck
signs, without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing
gates, or a human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage of a
train, the driver of a vehicle shall, in obedience to the railroad crossbuck
sign, yield the right of way and slow down to a speed reasonable for the
existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly marked
stop line, or if no stop line, within fifty feet (50') but not less than
fifteen feet (15') from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed
until he or she can do so safely. If the driver is involved in a collision at a
railroad crossing or interferes with the movement of a train after driving past
the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima facie
evidence of the driver's failure to yield right of way.
   (e)   A violation of any part of this Section shall result in a mandatory
fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or fifty (50) hours of community
service. (Ord. 0-96-08, 3-4-1996)

entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then
at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the
intersection. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to
any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway or which is
approaching so closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection,
but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a safe interval
occurs. Such intersections are set forth in Exhibit D, Section
22-164 of this Chapter. (M.C. 1963, § 20.203)
Sec. 22-63. Emerging From Alley, Building, Private Road Or Driveway:
   The driver of a vehicle emerging from an alley, building, private road or
driveway within an urban area shall stop such vehicle immediately prior to
driving into the sidewalk area extending across such alley, building entrance,
road or driveway, or in the event there is no sidewalk area, shall stop at the
point nearest the street to be entered where the driver has a view of
approaching traffic thereon, and shall yield the right of way to any pedestrian
as may be necessary to avoid collision, and upon entering the roadway shall
yield the right of way to all vehicles approaching on such roadway. (M.C. 1963,
§§ 20.301 and 20.306)

permit issued on the basis of including the entire lot to satisfy the minimum
bulk requirements of the governing zoning district;

compliance with the standards contained in all applicable Village codes,
including, but not limited to, the Building Code, and the applicable standards
for TCSF that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as
amended from time to time. The more stringent of the codes shall apply. If,
upon inspection, the Director concludes that a TCSF fails to comply with any
one or more of such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to person or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner or operator of the TCSF
and to the title holder of the property upon which the TCSF is located, the
owner, operator or title holder shall have thirty (30) days to bring such TCSF
into compliance with such standards. If the owner, operator or title holder
fails to bring such TCSF into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the
village may cause such TCSF to be removed at the expense of the owner, operator
or title holder, as the case may be.
   2.   Regulatory Compliance. All TCSF must meet the current standards and
regulations of the IEPA, if applicable, FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of
the state or federal government with the authority to regulate TCSF. If such
standards and regulations are changed, then the owners or operators of the TCSF
governed by this ordinance shall bring such TCSF into compliance with such
revised standards and regulations within one hundred twenty (120) days of the
effective date of such change in standards and regulations, unless a more
stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling agency. Failure to
bring TCSF into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the TCSF at the expense of the owner,
operator or title holder, as the case may be. All Applicants for installation
of TCSF must provide the Director of Community Development Department with a
certificate of compliance from each agency, federal or otherwise, having
jurisdiction over the owner or operator for the siting, construction,
installation or modification of the TCSF that the TCSF meets current standards

policies of the Deerfield Comprehensive Plan. These standards are intended to
promote the public health, safety, and welfare of the existing and future
residents of Deerfield by requiring certain residential developments or mixed-
use developments which contain a residential component to incorporate a
specified percentage of dwelling units to be priced affordably for households
with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI).
   The Village recognizes the need to provide affordable housing to low-to-
middle income households in order to increase housing opportunities for a
diverse population and to provide housing for those who live or work in the
Village. Without intervention, the trend toward increased housing prices will
result in an inadequate supply of affordable housing, which will have a
negative impact upon the ability of employers within the Village to maintain an
adequate local work force and will otherwise be detrimental to the public
health, safety, and welfare of the Village and its residents. Since the
remaining land appropriate for new residential development within the Village
is limited, it is essential that a reasonable proportion of such land be
developed into housing units affordable for low-to-middle income households and
working families.

development must satisfy the requirements of Section
2.14 by providing affordable housing units within the physical envelope of the
development, in the amounts to be calculated as follows:
      a.   General Requirement. For projects with fewer than 51 units, the
Affordable Requirement will be as set forth in the table below. For projects
with 51 units or more, 10 percent of the total number of dwelling units in a
governed development shall be marketed, offered, and maintained as affordable
housing units.
Affordable Attached (i.e. multi-family) Project Total Affordable Units Required
Number of Units
11-30 Units                                           1 Affordable Unit
31-40 Units                                           2 Affordable Units
41-50 Units                                           3 Affordable Units
51 + Units                                            10% Affordable Units
Affordable Detached (i.e. single-family) Project      Affordable Units Required

      b.   Fractional Units. When the application of the percentages specified
above results in a number of required affordable housing units that includes a
fraction, the fraction will be rounded up to the next whole number if the
fraction is equal to or greater than 0.5. If the result includes a fraction
equal to or less than 0.49, the required number of affordable housing units
will be rounded down to the next whole number.
   (2)   Eligible Income Tiers and Maximum Prices. Affordable units in governed
developments may only be offered to eligible households from the income tiers
and at the maximum price levels listed in the chart below.
 
Affordable

Explanatory Notes:
   a.   Housing Expenses: For affordable rental units, "housing expenses"
equals the monthly sum of rent and utilities. For affordable owner-occupied
units, "housing expenses" equals the monthly sum of principal and interest of
any mortgages placed on the unit, property taxes, condominium or homeowner's
association fees, if applicable, and insurance.
   b.   Attainability of Housing Expenses: Maximum housing prices are based on
spending 30 percent of monthly household income on housing expenses. Permitted
housing expenses for rental and affordable owner-occupied units will be
calculated based on the most current area median income levels published by
HUD.
   c.   Pricing Schedule. The Village Manager shall publish a Housing Expenses
Pricing Schedule of rental and sales prices for affordable housing units for
each income tier designated in Subsection
2.14-E, which pricing schedule will be made publicly available and will be
updated annually.
2.14-F   Incentives for Development of Affordable Housing Units
   Developers constructing governed developments incorporating the affordable
housing units required on-site will be allowed to take advantage of the
following incentives and development options. All incentives and options
authorized by this Section
2.14-F shall be proposed and memorialized in the affordable housing compliance
plan for the governed development.
   (1)   Additional Building Height. In order to accommodate affordable housing
units within a governed development, the Plan Commission may recommend, and the
Board of Trustees may approve, without the need of a variation, a height
increase of up to one story or 12 feet above the height limits in the
applicable zoning district other than in single family zoning districts.
   (2)   Reduced Off-street Parking Minimums. Any governed development
providing the minimum number of affordable housing units pursuant to Section
2.14 will be eligible to obtain greater flexibility in development design
through application of the following options without need for special zoning
relief, but only if such flexibility is necessary to accommodate the required
affordable units within the physical envelope of the governed development:
   In considering a proposed governed development with affordable housing
units, the Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may approve
a reduction in the otherwise applicable off-street parking minimums for the
affordable housing units. In considering the merits of such a reduction, the
Village shall consider the availability of alternative means of transportation,
including mass transit and bicycle facilities in the vicinity of the governed
development and any unique transportation needs of the expected residents.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be required to approve
any request for a waiver, reduction, or modification of any development
standard if the waiver, reduction, or modification would have an adverse impact
upon health, safety, or the physical environment for which there is no feasible
method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
   (3)   Fee Waivers and Reductions. Any governed development providing the
minimum number of affordable housing units pursuant to Section
2.14 shall be eligible for a partial waiver of all of the otherwise applicable
application fees, building permit fees, plan review fees, inspection fees,
demolition permit fees, and such other development fees and costs which may be
imposed by the Village, applicable to the portion of the governed development
that will consist of affordable housing units, up to a maximum of 15 percent of
all applicable fees. In no event shall the fee waiver be applied to any impact
fees or third-party legal, engineering, and other consulting or administrative
fees, costs, and expenses incurred or accrued by the Village in connection with
the review and processing of plans for the governed development. The waiver and
discount of fees and costs under this Section shall be calculated as the
percentage of units within the governed development that are affordable housing
units. All applicable fees and costs under this Code shall apply to all market
rate units.
   (4)   Standards for Approving Incentives. The Village Board, in determining
whether the incentives set forth in this Section
2.14-F should be available for a governed development, shall consider the
following:
      a.   Whether the incentives will result in conditions detrimental to the
public's health, safety, or welfare; and,
      b.   Whether the granting of the incentives will be compatible with the
intent and purpose of this section and other applicable Village land planning
documents.
   (5)   Any terms or conditions associated with the incentives shall be
stipulated in the affordable housing compliance plan and the affordable housing
covenant for the governed development.
2.14-G   Location and Design Attributes of Affordable Housing Units
   Affordable housing units in a governed development must comply with the
following standards, unless granted an exception by the Village Board as part
of the affordable housing compliance plan.
   (1)   Location of Affordable Housing Units. Affordable housing units must be
dispersed among the market rate housing units throughout the governed
development and not clustered together or segregated from market rate housing
unless there is a therapeutic or other justification particular to the
populations to be served by the affordable housing units.
   (2)   Size of Units. Affordable housing unit size must be generally
representative of and correspond to the size of the market-rate housing units
within the governed development.
   (3)   Phasing of Construction. In a governed development to be constructed
in multiple phases, each phase of the development must include a number of
affordable housing units proportional to the fraction that the phase consists
of the entire governed development. Construction of affordable housing units
may not be delayed or grouped into later phases of a governed development.
   (4)   Exterior Appearance. The exterior appearance of affordable housing
units in any governed development must be visually compatible with the market
rate housing units in the governed development. External building materials and
finishes must be substantially the same in type and quality for affordable
housing units as for market rate housing units. Affordable housing units shall
be indiscernible from market rate housing units from when viewed from interior
corridors and other common areas.
   (5)   Interior Appearance and Finishes. Affordable housing units may have
different interior appearances and finishes than market rate housing units, but
all interior finish materials used in affordable housing units must be
Contractor Grade or higher.
   (6)   Mix of Bedroom Types of Affordable Housing Units. The bedroom mix of
affordable housing units must be in equal proportion to the bedroom mix of the
market rate housing units within the governed development.
   (7)   Amenities. Affordable housing units must have similar access to common
areas, facilities, and services as that enjoyed by comparable market rate
housing units in a governed development including but not limited to outdoor
spaces, amenity spaces, storage, parking, bicycle parking facilities, and
resident services.
      a.   Parking Amenities. Regular access to at least one parking space per
affordable housing unit must be included with the occupancy of the unit without
any additional charge to the occupant above the maximum permitted housing
expenses for that unit. Additional parking spaces must be made available at the
same price and using the same method for allocation for market rate housing
units. Premium parking spaces, such as indoor parking, will not be required to
be allocated to the affordable housing units free of charge, provided that
required parking is provided elsewhere within the governed development.
      b.   Storage Amenities. To the extent that storage is allocated to all
market rate housing units within a governed development, similar storage space
must be allocated to all affordable housing units and included with the
occupancy of the unit without additional charge to the occupant above the
maximum permitted housing expenses for that unit. If storage space is not
allocated to all units due to insufficient ratio of storage space to
residential units, then the affordable housing units should have access to
storage in the same manner and proportion as do the market rate housing units,
at a cost discounted by the ratio of the affordable housing unit's housing
expenses to the equivalent size unit's market rent.
   (8)   Energy Efficiency. Standard improvements, fixtures, and components
related to energy efficiency, including, but not limited to, mechanical
equipment and plumbing, insulation, windows, and heating and cooling systems,
must be the same in market rate dwelling units and affordable housing units.
   (9)   Mixed Occupancy Developments. If a governed development includes both
rental housing units and owner-occupied housing units, the ratio of affordable
rental to affordable owner-occupied units marketed and offered must be equal to
the ratio of rental to owner-occupied market rate housing units marketed and
offered in the governed development.
2.14-H   Period of Affordability
   (1)   Sale of Affordable Owner-Occupied Units. In governed developments
include owner-occupied housing units, affordable housing units may be offered
and resold to only to eligible households and in accordance with Section
2.14 at all times that the units are used for residential purposes, in
perpetuity or as long as permissible by law. The developer or owner shall
execute and record any agreements, covenants, or instruments required by
Section
2.14 to ensure compliance with this Section
2.14-H.
   (2)   Lease of Affordable Rental Units.
      a.   In developments that contain rental units, affordable housing units
shall be offered and leased only to eligible households and in accordance with
Section
2.14 for so long as those units are used for residential purposes, in
perpetuity, as long as permissible by law, or as otherwise deemed appropriate
by the Village Board. The developer or owner shall execute and record any
agreements, covenants, or instruments required by Section
2.14 to ensure compliance with this Section
2.14-H. In the event that the owner of a governed development including
affordable rental units sells the development, the new owner will be required
to continue to offer the affordable housing units in accordance with Section
2.14.
      b.   If the owner of a governed development consisting of rental housing
units converts the development to condominiums or other form of owner-occupied
housing units, the development shall be subject to the owner-occupied
development requirements set forth in this Section
2.14-I. The Village shall have the option and right, but not the obligation, to
purchase any converted affordable owner-occupied units in the development
pursuant to this Code in accordance with the provisions of Subsection
2.14-J-4.
2.14-I   Affordability Controls for Affordable Owner-Occupied Units
   (1)   Initial Sale Prices for Affordable Owner-Occupied units. Permitted
initial sales prices for affordable owner-occupied units shall be set according
to a schedule published by the Village annually and calculated on the basis of:
      a.   Housing expenses at or below 30 percent of the designated eligible
income tiers set forth in Section
2.14-E, with a household size corresponding to the size of the unit.
      b.   The following relationship between unit size and household size
shall be used to determine the appropriate income level at which affordable
housing expenses are calculated:
 
Unit Size  Income Level for Household Size
Efficiency 1 Person
1 Bedroom  2 Persons
2 Bedrooms 3 Persons
3 Bedrooms 4 Persons
4 Bedrooms 5 Persons
 
      c.   An available fixed rate 30 year mortgage, consistent with the
average rate published from time to time by Freddie Mac;
      d.   A down payment of no more than five percent of the purchase price;
      e.   A calculation of property taxes;
      f.   A calculation of homeowner's insurance;
      g.   A calculation of condominium or homeowner association fees; and
      h.   A calculation of private mortgage insurance, if applicable.
   (2)   Procedure for Initial Sale of an Affordable Owner-Occupied Unit to an
Eligible Household.
      a.   60 days prior to offering any owner-occupied affordable unit for
sale to the public, a developer must notify the Village in writing of such
offering. The notice shall set forth the number, size, price, and location of
affordable housing units to be offered, and must provide a description of each
housing unit's finishes and availability. The notice must also include a copy
of the approved affordable housing compliance plan for the development, and any
such additional information the Village Manager may reasonably require in order
to establish compliance with Section
2.14.
      b.   The prospective purchaser must make application for a "certificate
of qualification" on a form provided by the Village. If the Village or its
designated not-for-profit partner organization determines a purchaser is an
eligible household pursuant to the requirements of Section
2.14 to purchase an affordable housing unit, it will issue a "certificate of
qualification" to that purchaser. A purchaser must provide documents to verify
that their household satisfies these requirements, including an affidavit that
the affordable housing unit will be their primary residence. Priority will be
given to eligible households in which the head of household, or spouse or
domestic partner of the head of household, currently reside within or work for
a private or public company located within the Village.
      c.   The developer may not sell or lease any affordable housing units
without a valid certificate of qualification from the Village for the
prospective purchaser.
   (3)   Maximum Resale Price and Maximum Appreciation.
      a.   The maximum resale price that an affordable owner-occupied unit may
be sold to an eligible household for shall be established in an affordable unit
covenant executed by the purchaser. This price will take into account the
maximum permitted appreciation allowed by this Subsection
2.14-I-3 as well as changes in the area median income.
         i.   The maximum resale price is an upper limit, but should not be
construed as a guarantee that the unit will be resold at that price.
         ii.   Market conditions, and characteristics of the affordable housing
unit, may result in the sale of an owner-occupied housing unit at a price lower
than the maximum resale price.
         iii.   The maximum permitted appreciation that may be claimed by the
owner of an affordable owner-occupied unit may not exceed 15 percent of the
increase in the unit's value, as determined by the difference between fair
market appraisal at the time of purchase of the unit by the current owner and a
fair market appraisal at the time of resale, with such adjustments for
improvements made by the current owner and necessary costs of sale which will
be accounted for in the price schedule published by the Village.
   (4)   Village First Option to Purchase. The Village shall have the first
option and right, but not an obligation, to purchase any affordable owner-
occupied unit prior to the unit being marketed or offered to the public. If the
Village exercises the option and purchases the affordable owner-occupied unit,
the Village will have the right to subject the unit to such agreements,
covenants, or instruments, to ensure the continued affordability of the unit in
accordance with Section
2.14. Such documentation shall incorporate the provisions of Section
2.14 and shall provide, at a minimum, each of the following:
      a.   The maximum resale price is an upper limit, but shall not be
construed as a guarantee that the unit will be resold at that price.
      b.   Market conditions, and characteristics of the affordable housing
unit, may result in the sale of an affordable housing unit at a price lower
than the calculated maximum resale price.
      The Village shall also reserve the right to assign and transfer its
interest in any affordable owner-occupied units that it purchases pursuant to
this Subsection to a not-for-profit partner organization.
   (5)   Purchases by Eligible Households. In all other sales of affordable
owner-occupied units between private eligible households, the parties to the
transaction will be required to execute and record such documentation as
required by Section
2.14-H of this Code to ensure the provision and continuous maintenance of the
affordable housing units. Such documentation shall include the provisions of
this Code and shall provide, at a minimum, each of the following:
      a.   That the purchaser acknowledges the Village's first option to
purchase the owner-occupied unit set forth in Section
2.14-I-4 of this Code.
      b.   In the event that the Village does not exercise its first option to
purchase, the affordable housing unit many only be sold to and occupied by an
eligible household.
      c.   The affordable housing unit may only be conveyed subject to
restrictions that shall permanently maintain the affordability of such
affordable housing units for eligible households, including a prohibition on
sales above the maximum resale price.
2.14-J   Affordability Controls for Affordable Rental Units
   (1)   Rental Rates for Affordable Rental Units. Permitted housing expenses
affordable rental units shall be set according to a schedule published by the
Village annually and calculated on the basis of:
      a.   Housing expenses at or below 30 percent of the designated eligible
income tiers set forth in Section
2.14-E-3, with a household size corresponding to the size of the unit.
      b.   If the most recent edition of HUD's reporting indicates a lower area
median income than the previous edition, the maximum housing expenses shall be
adjusted accordingly.
      c.   The following relationship between unit size and household size
shall be used to determine the appropriate income level at which affordable
housing expenses are calculated:
 
Unit Size  Income Level for Household Size
Efficiency 1 Person
1 Bedroom  2 Persons
2 Bedrooms 3 Persons
3 Bedrooms 4 Persons
4 Bedrooms 5 Persons
 
   (2)   Procedure for Initial Lease of an Affordable Rental Unit to an
Eligible Household.
      a.   60 days prior to offering any affordable housing unit for sale or
rent, the developer must notify the Village in writing of such offering. The
notice must set forth the number, size, price, and location of affordable
housing units offered, and provide a description of each dwelling unit's
finishes and availability. The notice must also include a copy of the
affordable housing compliance plan, and any such additional information the
Village may reasonably require in order to establish compliance with Section 
2.14.
      b.   The prospective lessee must make application for a "certificate of
qualification" on a form provided by the Village. If the Village or its
designated not-for-profit partner organization determines a lessee is an
eligible household pursuant to the requirements of Section
2.14 to lease an affordable housing unit, it will issue a "certificate of
qualification" to that lessee. A lessee must provide documents to verify that
their household satisfies these requirements, including an affidavit that the
affordable housing unit will be his or her primary residence. The Village will
determine whether or not the prospective lessee satisfies the requirements of
Section
2.14 no later than 10 business days after receiving the completed application.
Priority will be given to eligible households in which the head of household,
or spouse or domestic partner of the head of household, currently reside within
or work for a private or public company located within the Village.
      c.   The developer shall not lease any affordable rental units without a
valid certificate of qualification from the contracted agency for the
prospective lessee. Any lease for an affordable rental unit shall also contain
a prohibition on subleasing or allowing occupancy by a household without a
valid certificate of qualification.
   (3)   Lease Term. No affordable rental unit may be initially leased for a
period of less than 12 months. All leases must be written and in a form
approved by the Village. Renewal leases may be less than 12 months based on
mutual agreement between the developer and tenant. Final lease agreements are
the responsibility of the developer and the prospective tenant. Tenants are
responsible for application fees, security deposits and the full amount of the
rent as stated on the lease. All lease provisions shall comply with applicable
laws and regulations. The developer shall maintain copies of all leases entered
into with a certified household (including an income certification) and
distribute a copy to the Village or its designated not-for-profit partner
organization.
   (4)   Rental Compliance. The developer, or its designee, shall submit an
annual compliance report describing each affordable unit in detail including
but not limited to changes in tenancy, turnovers, and income certifications for
all new tenants upon request of the Village Manager.
2.14-K   Marketing of Affordable Housing Units
   (1)   Good Faith Marketing Required. All sellers and lessors of affordable
housing units are responsible for marketing the affordable housing units to
members of the public who are likely to be eligible households qualified to
purchase or lease affordable housing units. Prior to the initiation of public
marketing efforts to sell or lease an affordable housing unit, the seller or
lessor thereof shall submit to the Village Manager a description of the
marketing plan that the developer proposes to implement for the affordable
housing units within the development to eligible households in the appropriate

whether to grant a waiver, the Village Board shall consider the economic
viability of the proposed project and whether the granting of the waiver will
advance the Village's planning objectives and the general welfare of Village

5.02   C-2 OUTLYING COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
5.02-A   District Description and Policies
   1.   Description
   The C-2 Outlying Commercial District is a specialized district established
to permit and regulate commercial uses which are essentially automobile
oriented and which are located outside of the Village Center. This District
recognizes that significant traffic problems exist along adjoining arterial
traffic routes, and that without careful planning and design, such traffic
problems may be acutely intensified. The uses in this District will be
carefully regulated to control their impact upon public facilities and other
types of uses. Expansion of the C-2 Outlying Commercial District will be
discouraged except in areas where significant considerations make the area
particularly suitable for this type of commercial development.
   2.   Policies
      a.   Planned Developments pursuant to Article
12 will be encouraged.
      b.   Strip commercial development is the development of an elongated
commercial district which parallels a highway or street and which may include,
but is not limited to, one or more of the following characteristics: shallow
lot depth with abutting non-commercial uses to the rear, inadequate front yard
landscaping, a proliferation of ingress and egress points, inadequate sign
control, and inadequate provisions for off-street parking and loading
facilities. Creation of a new strip commercial development will be discouraged.
Extension of existing strip commercial developments will be permitted only when
such development would constitute the sole reasonable use of the property,
where adequate buffering is provided and where traffic flow and capacity will
not be adversely affected.
      c.   Safety and convenience in the public streets and highways shall be
protected by strict regulation of access points and by the requirement of
adequate off-street parking and loading spaces.
      d.   To preserve and promote the development of the Village in an
attractive manner and to assist in stabilizing of land values along zoning
district boundaries, open space, fencing and landscaping will be required and
signage will be controlled pursuant to the regulations of this Ordinance.

individual sign faces as determined below. (See Art.
14 Definitions, Sign Face.)
   2.   Gross Surface Area of a Wall Sign
      a.   Mounted Directly on a Wall
      The gross surface area of a wall sign shall be computed by finding the
area of the smallest single rectangle which encompasses all of the signage
panels and/or signage elements comprising the sign face and any gaps of spaces
between any of the signage panels and/or signage elements.
      b.   Decorative Framing
      Where a wall sign consists of signage panels and/or signage elements
displayed so that they are either enclosed or partially enclosed by a
decorative frame, the gross area of the sign face shall be computed by finding
the area of the smallest single rectangle which encompasses all the signage
elements and/or the signage panels, any gaps or spaces between any of the
signage panels and/or signage elements, and the decorative frame.
      c.   Structural Supports/Sign Boxes
      When a wall sign consists of signage panels or elements displayed on a
surface which is mounted in a sign box or is mounted in some type of a support
which is mounted on the wall, the computation of the gross area of the sign
face will not include those structural supports or components unless such
structural supports or components are designed in such a way so as to
constitute signage elements.
   3.   Gross Surface Area of a Ground Sign Face
      a.   Pole or Post Mounted Sign
         (1)   Single Surface Area Sign Face
         The gross surface area of a sign face which is comprised of signage
panels or elements displayed on a single surface shall be computed by
determining the gross surface area of the surface upon which the signage panels
or elements are displayed. The structural supports or components shall not be
included in computing the area of the sign face if they are located on the
perimeter of the sign face. All structural supports or components will be
included in the computation of the area of the sign face if signage elements
are displayed thereon.
         (2)   Multiple Surface Sign Face
         If the sign face is comprised of multiple surfaces or panels upon
which signage panels or elements are displayed, the gross surface area of the
sign face will be computed by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle
which encompasses all of the signage surfaces, panels and/or elements, and any
gaps or spaces between the surfaces, elements or panels. The structural
supports or components shall not be included in computing the area of the sign
face if they are located on the perimeter of the sign face. All structural
supports or components will be included in the computation of the area of the
sign face if signage elements are displayed thereon.
         (3)   Floating Letter Sign
         When a sign consists of letters, logos, or other signage elements
which are not displayed or mounted on or against a surface but are held in
place by a bar or other similar support device, the area of the sign face shall
be computed by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle which
encompasses all of the letters, logos, decorative frames or other signage
elements comprising the sign face. All gaps and spaces between any of the
letters, logos, or other signage elements are to be included within the
rectangle.
         (4)   Architectural/Decorative Ornamentation
         If architectural/decorative ornamentation is made a part of a ground
sign or is mounted on or attached to a ground sign, then the gross area of the
sign face shall be computed by finding the area of the smallest single
rectangle which encompasses all of the signage elements and/or panels and the
architectural/decorative ornamentation.
      b.   Monument Sign - Mounted on a Pedestal Base or Footing
         (1)   General Method
         The gross surface area of a monument sign face shall be the area of
the surface of the monument upon which the signage elements and/or signage
panels are mounted or displayed as measured from the top of the sign face to
the top of the pedestal, base, reveal, or footing upon which the sign is
mounted. When a monument sign is mounted on a pedestal, base, reveal or
footing, the area of such pedestal, base, reveal or footing shall be excluded
in any computation of the gross area of the sign unless signage elements or
signage panels are located thereon or such a pedestal, base, reveal, or footing
is designed in such a way so as to constitute a signage element. If any signage
elements are displayed or are in any way incorporated onto the pedestal, base,
reveal or footing, then the area of the sign face will be determined by
computing the area of the smallest single rectangle which encompasses all of
the surfaces containing signage elements.
         (2)   Exception
         If the pedestal, base, reveal, or footing extends less than eighteen
(18) inches above grade and no signage elements or panels are located less than
eighteen (18) inches above grade, the area of the sign face which is less than
eighteen inches or less above grade at the base of the sign will be excluded in
computing the area of the sign face.
         (3)   Structural Supports
         Structural supports or components shall not be included in computing
the area of the sign face if they are located on the perimeter of the sign
face. All structural supports or components will be included in the computation
of the area of the sign face if signage elements are displayed thereon.
         (4)   Cut-Out Letter or Other Signage Elements
         When the signage displayed on a pedestal, base, or footing consists of
cut-out letters or other signage elements, the area of the sign face shall be
computed by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle which encompasses
all of the cut-out letters and other signage elements. If any signage elements
are displayed or are in any way incorporated onto the pedestal, base, or
footing, then the rectangle must be drawn so as to include all of the surfaces
upon which any signage is mounted. (See Article
9.01-E,3,b,(2) for exceptions pertaining to the pedestal, base, reveal, or
footing.)
      c.   Signage Mounted on a Freestanding Wall
      When signage elements are mounted on a freestanding wall, the entire area
of the side of the wall on which the signage is mounted shall be included in
the computation of the area of the sign face. A freestanding wall includes a
wall which is not an integral part of a building but is a wall which is
designed solely as an architectural amenity. (See Appendix
II)

9.03-K   Temporary Marketing Signs - Planned Unit Development
(Ord. 0-94-32)
   1.   R-5 General Residence District Planned Unit Development
   Because of the unique nature of R-5 General Residence District Planned Unit
Developments and the tendency for such developments to be larger than
developments constructed under the underlying district provisions, the Village
recognizes that certain temporary signage may be necessary and desirable to
best serve the interests of the Village.
   2.   Minimum Size of Site
   Temporary development marketing signs shall only be permitted for R-
5 Planned Unit Developments of 30 acres or larger in size.
   3.   Planned Unit Development Signage Plan
   Temporary development marketing signs shall only be permitted as part of the
approved signage plan for a Residential Planned Unit Development in the R-
5 General Residence District.
Such signs may be permitted subject to the following:
      a.   Number, content, and type
      One temporary development marketing ground sign may be permitted for each
frontage and shall be located on such frontage. Such sign may indicate the name
of the development and such information as necessary for the sale of the units
in the development which may include the name of the development and developer,
the types and number of units available, the phone number, and occupancy date.
In any sign having two sides or faces the information contained shall be
identical on each side or face.
      b.   Area
      The maximum surface area for a temporary development marketing ground
sign shall not exceed twenty (20) square feet per face, nor shall there be more
than two (2) faces.
      c.   Location
      Temporary development marketing ground signs may be located in the
required perimeter setbacks. The location of such signs shall be determined by
the Director of Community Development, taking into consideration factors which
bear upon the health, safety, and general well-being of the Village, including
special attention to traffic safety concerns. In no event may the sign be
closer than fifty (50) feet from the property line.
      However, if the placement of the sign as permitted is not feasible
because of the location of buildings, berms, swales, or other features of the
development, the Director of Community Development may authorize the sign to be
located less than fifty (50) feet from the property line but only to the
minimum extent necessary. Said sign may be relocated from time to time if
necessary because of site work or construction occurring on the site but only
if approved by the Director.
      d.   Lighting
      Temporary development marketing signs may not be illuminated.
      e.   Time
      Temporary development marketing signs may be erected for a time period of
one year with renewals of time of up to one year.
      f.   Angle
      The Director of Community Development shall determine the maximum angle
permitted if the two sign faces are not parallel to each other. In no event
shall such angle exceed 90 degrees.
      g.   Height
      Temporary development marketing signs may not project higher than eight
(8) feet above the level of the curb nearest to the property line adjacent to
the right-of-way. If the placement of the sign as permitted is not feasible
because of the location of buildings, berms, swales, or other features of the
development, the Director of Community Development may approve the placement of
the sign at a grade other than the elevation of the curb. In no event shall the
overall height of the sign from its base to its top exceed eight (8) feet in
height.
      h.   Special Conditions
      The Director of Community Development may impose conditions or
restrictions on any such temporary development marketing signs as it deems
appropriate to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the Village.
9.04   NONCONFORMING SIGNS
9.04-A   Declaration of Public Policy
   It is reasonable that a time limit be placed upon the continuance of
existing nonconforming signs. An amortization program permits the owner to plan
during a period when he is allowed to continue the nonconforming signs while at
the same time assuring that the district in which the nonconforming signs exist
will eventually benefit from a substantial uniformity of permanent signs.
9.04-B   Definition of Nonconforming Signs
   A nonconforming sign shall be any sign which:
   1.   On the effective date of this Ordinance was lawfully erected in
accordance with the provisions of any prior zoning or other applicable
Ordinance but which signs dues not conform to the limitations and standards
established by this Ordinance in the district in which the sign is located; or
   2.   On or after the effective date of this Ordinance was lawfully
maintained and erected in accordance with the provisions of the amendatory
Ordinance but which sign, by reason of amendment to this Article after the
effective date thereof, does not conform to the limitations established by the
amendment to this Ordinance in the district in which the sign is located.
9.04-C   Continuance of Nonconforming Signs
   1.   Subject to the termination hereinafter provided, any nonconforming sign
may be continued in operation and maintained after the effective date of this
Ordinance, provided, however, that no such sign shall be changed in any manner
that increases the nonconformity of such sign with the provisions hereof
established for signs in the district in which the sign is located; and
provided further, that the burden of establishing a sign to be nonconforming
under this Article, rests entirely upon the person or persons, firm or
corporation claiming a nonconforming status for a sign.
   2.   A sign which is nonconforming only by reason of its height or size and
does not exceed the standards of this Ordinance in such respects by more than
ten percent (10%), shall not be subject to termination by amortization as
hereinafter provided.
9.04-D   Termination of Nonconforming Signs
   1.   By Abandonment
   Abandonment or cessation for a period of ninety (90) days or the change of
the principal use to which the nonconforming sign is accessory shall terminate
immediately the right to maintain such sign.
   2.   By Violation of the Ordinance
   Any violation of the provisions of this Article shall terminate immediately
the right to maintain a nonconforming sign.
   3.   By Destruction, Damage or Obsolescence
   The right to maintain any nonconforming sign shall terminate and shall cease
to exist whenever the sign:
      a.   Is damaged or destroyed, from any cause whatsoever, to the extent
that its repair or replacement cost exceeds fifty (50%) percent of its
replacement costs as of the date it became nonconforming, or
      b.   Becomes obsolete or substandard under any applicable Ordinance of
the Village, or
      c.   Becomes a hazard or a danger
   4.   By Amortization
   The right to maintain a nonconforming sign shall terminate in any event in
accordance with the following schedule:
 
Any sign which on the date the sign Shall be terminated or made to conform
became nonconforming would cost the within the following period after the sign
following amount to replace:        became nonconforming:
$0 to $3,000                        2 years
...............................
$3,001 to $6,000                    3 years
...........................
$6,001 to $15,000                   4 years
..........................
$15,001 to more                     5 years

9.05-C   Removal of Certain Signs
   1.   Unsafe and Unlawful Signs
      a.   If the Director of Building and Zoning shall find that any sign or
other advertising structure is unsafe or insecure, or is a danger to the public
safety, or has been constructed or erected or is being maintained in violation
of the provisions of this Ordinance, he shall give written notice to the
permittee thereof or the owner of the premises where located. If the permittee
or owner fails to repair, remove or alter the structure so as to comply with
the standards herein set forth, within twenty (20) days after giving or such
notice, such sign or other advertising structure may be removed by the Director
of Building and Zoning at the expense of the person to whom such notice was
given.
      b.   The Director of Building and Zoning may cause any sign or other
advertising structure which is an immediate peril to persons or property, to be
removed without notice and at the expense of the permittee or owner.
   2.   Obsolete Signs
   Any signs or other advertising structure now or hereafter existing, which
advertises a business no longer being conducted, or a product no longer being
sold, shall be taken down and removed by the owner, agent, or person having the
beneficial use of the building, structure or premises upon which it may be
found, within twenty (20) days after written notification from the Director of
Building and Zoning. Upon failure to comply with such notice within the time
specified, in such order, the Director of Building and Zoning is hereby
authorized to cause removal of such sign and any expense incidental thereto
shall be paid by the person to whom such notice was given.
   3.   Nonconforming Signs
   Nonconforming signs shall be removed by their owner within ten (10) days of

under this Article shall be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals as hereinafter
provided in Article
13, Administration and Enforcement.
   2.   All requests for modifications, variations, and exceptions from the
regulations set forth in this Article shall be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals as hereinafter provided in Article
13, Administration and Enforcement, unless the request is for a modification,
variation, or exception made to the Appearance Review Commission pursuant to
Section
9.05-E of this Code. Applicants for modifications, variations, and exceptions
from the regulations set forth in this Article must also seek an Appearance
Review Certificate from the Appearance Review Commission in addition to any
other administrative approvals required under Article
13 of this Code. (Ord. O-22-18)
9.05-E   Appearance Review Commission Authority to Grant Variations Up to Three
Feet for Signs Located Above the Roof Deck of a Building. (Ord. O-13-35)
   Notwithstanding anything in Article
9 that prohibits commercial wall signs to be located above the roof deck of a
building, the Appearance Review Commission is authorized to grant variations
allowing wall signs to be located up to three (3) feet above the roof deck of a
building in the Village's commercial zoning districts after they have reviewed
the applicant's request and determined there is sound and adequate reason for
the wall sign to be located above the roof deck. (Ord. O-13-35)
9.05-F   Sign Criteria (Ord. O-22-14)
   1.   Intent. The intent of the regulation of sign criteria is to ensure that
properties with multiple buildings, and buildings with multiple occupants or
tenants, provide signage that is well-designed and consistent throughout that
building or property, while providing some flexibility for the alteration or
replacement of signs that are approved through sign criteria.
   2.   Applicability. Proposed sign criteria may be submitted to the
Appearance Review Commission for review and approval in accordance with this
Section for any multi-tenant commercial development, office building or
association of merchants doing business within a specific area within the
Village, or any property that has frontage along two or more streets for which
an application would be required to be submitted for more than one sign on that
property.
   3.   Process. To obtain approval of sign criteria, an applicant must submit
a complete application to the Village's Principal Planner or the Principal
Planner's designee, who will review the application and transmit it to the
Appearance Review Commission. The Appearance Review Commission will, within a
reasonable time, hold a public meeting to review the proposed sign criteria.
The Appearance Review Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny
an application for sign criteria.
   4.   Contents of Sign Criteria Application. An application for sign criteria
must include details regarding the design and location of all proposed signs
for which a sign permit is required. At minimum, the applicant must provide the
following details:
      a.   Sign design, materials, anchorage, and support(s);
      b.   Sign location(s);
      c.   Sign color(s);
      d.   Sign dimensions; and
      e.   Method of illumination, if any.
   5.   Standards. No sign criteria will be approved by the Appearance Review
Commission unless the Appearance Review Commission finds that the sign criteria
are:
      a.   Unified and consistent throughout the building, property, or
designated area;
      b.   Of the same or higher quality than would otherwise be required under
the applicable sign regulations; and
      c.   Compliant with the Appearance Code.
   6.   Exemption from Appearance Review Certificate. Signs that (i) conform to
the approved sign criteria for the applicable property; (ii) conform to the
Appearance Code, the Zoning Ordinance, and all applicable Village regulations;
and (iii) require no architectural changes to the building or other structures
on the applicable property are exempt from the Appearance Review Certificate
requirements, unless the Principal Planner or the Principal Planner's designee
identify unique circumstances that would cause an Appearance Review Certificate
to be necessary. The Principal Planner or the Principal Planner's designee,
upon review of the sign permit application, may issue a sign permit if all
signs are in compliance with this subsection without the applicant having to
appear before or obtain approval from the Appearance Review Commission.
   7.   Private Sign Agreements. Nothing in this Section prevents any property
owner or property association from establishing, by lease, association
governing documents, or other form of agreement, sign regulations that are more
stringent than this Section.

10.04   Conversion to a Special Use
10.05   Elimination of Nonconforming Structures and Uses

   This Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. Within such districts, however, there exist lots, structures, uses of
land and structures, and characteristics of uses which were lawful before this
Ordinance was passed or amended, but which are prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments hereto.
   Recognizing both the legitimate interest of those who lawfully established
such a nonconformity and the need to protect the public health, safety, comfort
and general welfare, the provisions of this Article are intended to provide for
the regulation of nonconformities within the following:
   10.00-A It is the intent of this Article to permit most nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
   10.00-B It is the intent of this Article that nonconformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   10.00-C It is recognized and declared that those nonconformities which
substantially and adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use
and taxable value of other property in the district (property that is itself
subject to the regulations of this Ordinance) should eventually be eliminated.
10.01   CONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES
   Any nonconforming structure or principal use which exists lawfully at the
time of the adoption of this Ordinance and which remains nonconforming or which
shall become nonconforming upon the adoption of this Ordinance or any
subsequent amendment thereto, may be continued only in accordance with the
provisions of Article
10.01-A and

   No nonconforming use of a building or structure shall be:
   1.   Renewed if abandoned for a continuous period of one (1) year;

   1.   Structural alterations or repairs of a nonconforming building required
by law shall be permitted.
   2.   In the C-1, Village Center District, a nonconforming structure may be
structurally altered if such structural alteration does not result in the
enlargement of the exterior dimensions of the structure.

from nonconforming to conforming; such a structure or use may be:
      a.   Structurally altered;

structure, it may be restored or reconstructed if initiated within one year of
partial destruction and diligently pursued to completion.
   5.   Ord. O-94-04
      a.   No nonconforming structure located in a residential district shall
be structurally altered or enlarged in such a manner that would further
increase the non-conformity. However, enlargements or structural alterations
may be permitted providing there is no increase in the existing encroachments.
      b.   A nonconforming structure located in a residential district and
occupied by a Permitted or Special Use may be structurally altered, enlarged or
restored. Alterations, enlargement or restoration in excess of fifty percent

the intentional demolition of the structure, may be restored or reconstructed
if initiated within one year of such destruction and diligently pursued to
completion, provided that the structure shall not be altered, enlarged or
restored in a manner that would further increase the non-conformity with the
requirements of said amendatory ordinance.

12.00   Preamble
12.01   General Provisions
12.02   Residential Planned Unit Development
12.03   Planned Residential Developments
12.04   Village Center/Residential Planned Unit Developments

Residential Developments
12.00   PREAMBLE
12.00-A   Intent (Ord. 0-82-10)
   The intent of this Article is to permit and encourage a more creative,
imaginative and desirable approach to certain residential, commercial and
industrial developments than is generally possible under conventional zoning
regulations. By allowing a greater flexibility of project design and by
supporting the union or planning and development, these regulations seek to
enhance the character of the Village in accordance with the Village's goals as
set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. The flexibility permitted by these
regulations shall be utilized as a means to achieve a modern, safe, efficient
and visually appealing community, not simply as a means to attract development
or to circumvent the intent and purposes of this Ordinance.
   It is also the intent of this Article to continue to permit Planned
Residential Developments in that area bounded by Lake Cook Road, Wilmot Road,
Hackberry Road and Willow Avenue. A planned residential development in this
area is the use and development for single-family detached residential purposes
of a compact and contiguous parcel or tract of land under single ownership, or
if the ownership is diverse, then under unified control pursuant to an
agreement of such owners. This parcel or tract shall have sufficient area to
permit its development in accordance with an orderly plan with due allowance
for the similar development of adjoining properties, and in accordance with the
regulations and conditions prescribed in this Article.
   Additionally, it is the intent of this Article to permit and encourage the
redevelopment of those properties lying between the Chicago, Milwaukee, St.
Paul and Pacific Railroad right-of-way and Waukegan Road, which properties
front on the west side of Hoffman Lane, on Osterman Avenue, on Waverly Court or
on Central Avenue. A Village Center/Residential Planned Unit Development in
this area is for the use and development of multiple-family dwellings. Also, a
Village Center/Commercial Planned Unit Development is restricted to those
properties fronting on the west side of Hoffman Lane or on the north side of
Osterman Avenue between Waukegan Road on the east and the right-of-way of the
Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad on the west. The Village
Center/Commercial Planned Unit Development in this area is for the use and
development of those properties for office uses or for mixed use structures
containing a combination of office uses, commercial uses and/or multiple-family
dwellings.
12.00-B   Objectives
   The Planned Unit Development procedure has the following among its
objectives:
   1.   Flexibility and Variety
   To promote flexibility in design and permit planned variety in the type and
location of structure and uses.
   2.   Efficiency and Economy
   To promote the efficient use of land to facilitate a more economic
arrangement of buildings, parking, circulation systems and utilities.
   3.   Site Character
   To provide a procedure which can relate the type, design and layout of
residential, commercial and industrial development to the particular site,
thereby encouraging preservation to the greatest extent possible of the site's
natural character, its landscape and topography.
   4.   Open Space and Amenities
   To provide for more usable and suitably located recreational facilities and
open space and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be
provided under the strict application of conventional zoning.
   5.   Assurances
   To assure the Village, and future occupants and future owners of Planned
Unit Developments that the amenities, circulation systems, utilities, and other
components of the approved plan including those usually provided as public
improvements will be established in accordance with the approved final
development plan and with other requirements placed on the Planned Unit
Development.
12.01   GENERAL PROVISIONS
12.01-A   Planned Unit Development As Special Use
   Planned Unit Development may be approved and authorized by Ordinance as a
Special Use in R-5, General Residence District and in all Commercial and
Industrial Districts in accordance with the standards and procedures of this
Article.
12.01-B   Applicable Regulations
   1.   Exceptions (Ord. O-85-09)
   A Planned Unit Development shall be governed by the regulations of the
zoning district or districts in which it is located, except as provided in this
Article and as modified by and authorized in the Ordinance approving the
Planned Unit Development. Said Ordinance may provide for such exceptions from
the District regulations governing setbacks, lot width, height, parking and
subdivision design standards as may be desirable to achieve the objectives of
the proposed Planned Unit Development, provided such exceptions are consistent
with the standards and criteria contained in this Article.
   2.   Improvements (Ord. 0-93-53)
   In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Planned Unit Development
and the Village of Deerfield, the Village may determine that the best interests
of the Village are served by permitting the provision of certain improvements
as private rather than public improvements. It may also be determined that such
improvements should be permitted at less than those specifications set out in
the Zoning Ordinance, Deerfield Subdivision Code or the Municipal Code of
Deerfield. Such exceptions shall be permitted at the discretion of the
Corporate Authorities. The Corporate Authorities shall also determine the
extent to which such improvements will be publicly owned and maintained. Such
improvements shall include but shall not be limited to streets, sidewalks,
street lights, fire hydrants, utility lines, and landscaping. The Corporate
Authorities shall require the establishment of funds in accordance with the
provisions of Article
12.09 and the Municipal Code to guarantee the establishment and completion of
all improvements, whether private or public, as approved in the final
development plan.
   Additionally, improvements other than those listed above which are approved
as part of the final development plan shall be deemed to be included as private
improvements and governed by Article 12.01-G. Such improvements may include
landscaping, fencing, and site amenities. The Corporate Authorities may grant
exceptions to these requirements.
   3.   Subdivision or Resubdivision (Ord. 0-88-54)
   Furthermore, in those Planned Unit Developments where the subdivision or
resubdivision of the subject property is desired, said subdivision and
resubdivision may be granted although the lots so created do not each meet all
of the Village's requirements as found in the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision
Code, or Municipal Code.
   Such subdivision or resubdivision shall only be approved if the purpose for
creating said subdivision or resubdivision is to reflect the differing
ownership of the lots within the Planned Unit Development. Said subdivision or
resubdivision will not create any rights not specifically permitted by the
ordinance establishing the Planned Unit Development. If any changes to the
governing Planned Unit Development are desired, i.e. provision of fencing, such
changes may only be made upon the recommendation of the Plan Commission
following a public hearing and approval of the Board of Trustees. Any lots in
said subdivision or resubdivision which will be reserved for the use and/or
benefit of all of the owners of lots within the PUD shall be clearly marked
accordingly on the subdivision or resubdivision plat along with any additional
language which the Village deems appropriate to indicate the use for which the
lots are reserved and also that said lots do not constitute a "lot of record"
as that term is defined by either the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision Code and
further that the only improvement which will be permitted on said lot is that
which is authorized by the governing Planned Unit Development Ordinance. If,
after the adoption and recording of the Planned Unit Development Ordinance and
subdivision or resubdivision plat, no substantial construction has begun or no
use has been established in the Planned Unit Development within the time stated
in the development schedule contained in the Final Development Plan thereby
causing the Special Use to expire, the Village Board may automatically vacate
the subdivision or resubdivision plat.
12.01-C   Effect of Approval
   1.   Approval of a Planned Unit Development for a tract of land shall not
affect the rights of the property owner or owners to develop the property in
conformance with the provisions of the underlying zoning district.
   2.   However, when a Planned Unit Development has been granted and
conditions and guarantees imposed, as hereinafter provided, and site
development of such Planned Unit Development has commenced:
      a.   The rights of the property owner or owners to develop the property
in conformance with the provisions of the underlying zoning district are
forfeit, and there shall be the obligation to complete the Planned Unit
Development as set forth on the Final Development Plan and related regulations
approved as part of the Ordinance granting the Planned Unit Development, or
      b.   A new Final Development plan shall be required for any further
development of the site.
12.01-D   Coordination with Subdivision Ordinance
   When any Planned Unit Development requires the subdivision or resubdivision
of land, the review of the proposed subdivision or resubdivision under the
Subdivision Ordinance of the Village of Deerfield shall proceed simultaneously
with the review of the Planned Unit Development under this Zoning Ordinance.
12.01-E   General Standards and Criteria
   All Planned Unit Developments shall meet the following general standards and
criteria:
   1.   Village Planning Goals
   A Planned Unit Development must be compatible with and implement the

12.07-A   Purpose and Intent
   In order to promote the goals and objectives of the Village's Comprehensive
Plan, certain development incentive provisions are established for the area
formed by those properties lying between the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and
Pacific Railroad right-of-way and Waukegan Road, which properties front on the
west side of Hoffman Lane, on Osterman, on Waverly Court, or on Central Avenue.
Those provisions are established to further the following specific purposes:
   1.   To provide an incentive for the redevelopment of this area utilizing
the Village Center/Residential PUD procedures for the use and development of
multi-family dwellings.
   2.   To provide for the redevelopment of the area formed by those properties
between the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad right-of-way and
Waukegan Road, which properties front on the west side of Hoffman Lane, or on
the north side of Osterman utilizing the Village Center/Commercial Planned Unit
Development procedures for the use and development of those properties for any
office uses and for mixed use structures containing office uses and multi-
family dwellings.
   3.   To provide good access, both pedestrian and vehicular, to the
properties throughout the area and to the commercial areas to the north and
east.
   4.   To provide pedestrian amenities and open space in order to produce a
more attractive area.
In furthering the above, three specific categories of public amenities will be
considered in determining the amount of development incentives to be given:
      1.   Open space amenities which could include wider setbacks than those
required, public plazas and parks, enclosed parking, or other items which would
serve to increase the amount and quality of useable open space in a particular
development.
      2.   Traffic and pedestrian amenities which would serve to enhance the
traffic and pedestrian flow which could include open arcades, wider sidewalks,
or interconnections with surrounding developments.
      3.   Use amenities which include developing properties with those uses
designated in the Village's Comprehensive Plan and specifically developing a
lot as part of the development, which lot by reason of its location between
other parcels under common ownership, would otherwise be rendered
undevelopable.
12.07-B   Maximum Development Incentives Allowed
   Modification of the bulk, height, and setback requirements are possible, but
in no event shall the incentives permit development in excess of the following
limitations:
   1.   The maximum building height is limited to 55 feet.
   2.   The maximum ground coverage permitted if the majority of the required
parking is provided within the building shall not exceed 50%.
   3.   The maximum reduction in required setbacks shall be limited to that
which is necessary to provide adequate fire protection for the particular
building proposed.
12.07-C   Criteria
   In determining the extent of development incentives to be granted for the
inclusion of any amenity, the following are to be considered:
   1.   The amount of floor area by which the total floor area of the building
is reduced due to the inclusion of the amenity.
   2.   The direct construction cost of the amenity.
   3.   The amount of continuing maintenance required for the amenity.
   4.   The degree to which the inclusion of the amenity furthers the
objectives of the Village Center/Residential Planned Unit Development District
or the Village Center/Commercial Planned Unit Development District.
12.07-D   Procedure
   1.   Application
   Development incentives may be approved and authorized by ordinance as part
of the Special Use granted for either Village Center/Residential Planned Unit
Development or a Village Center/Commercial Planned Unit Development in
accordance with the standards and procedures outlines in Article
12, Planned Unit Developments.
   Applications for development incentives will be made in conjunction with the
application for the approval of the Planned Unit Development. Such application
will include any plans and drawings and documentation necessary to determine
the amount of development incentives to be given.
   2.   Recommendation of the Plan Commission
   The Plan Commission shall recommend to the Board of Trustees the extent of
development incentive provisions to be given as part of their recommendation
concerning the Preliminary Development Plan for the Planned Unit Development.
   3.   Board of Trustees Action
   The Board of Trustees shall consider and act upon the Plan Commission's
recommendation in the course of its Preliminary Development Plan approval

conditions as they deem appropriate upon the Applicant for development
incentives to insure that the furnishing of and future maintenance where
applicable of the amenities forming the basis of the development amenities are
insured. Said conditions may include provisions for restrictive covenants and
the posting of surety bonds, escrow deposits or similar financial guarantees to
achieve these objectives. Failure of an applicant to comply with such
conditions may result, at the discretion of the Board of Trustees, in either
the denial of development incentives or, if subsequent to development,
termination of the Special Use Permit.

RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS
(Ord. 0-22-15)
12.11-A   Minor Amendments
   1.   A minor, administrative amendment to a planned unit development or
Final Development Plan is a "minor amendment" and may be approved by the
Village Principal Planner upon a finding that the amendment is consistent with
the intent and purpose of the planned unit development or planned residential
development and provided such minor amendment will not result in one or more of
the following:
      A.   A change in the allowed land uses on the subject property;
      B.   A change to the boundaries of the planned unit development or
planned residential development;
      C.   An increase in the number of dwelling units in excess of the lesser
of three units or five percent of the maximum number of dwelling units allowed
in the Final Development Plan. Increases in the maximum number of units may not
be made if such increase conflicts with the approved parking ratio, decreases
approved setbacks, adversely affects the character of the development or
exceeds the approved floor area ratio. Increases in the maximum number of units
may be made only once per planned unit development or planned residential
development to be considered a minor amendment;
      D.   An increase by more than one percent in Floor Area or building
square footage;
      E.   An increase in the size of approved building pads;
      F.   A substantial increase in the traffic volume generated by, or
traffic circulation of, the planned unit development or planned residential
development;
      G.   A reduction of more than one percent in approved common open space;
      H.   A reduction in the number of off-street parking or loading spaces
required pursuant to Article
8, Off-Street Parking and Off-Street Loading;
      I.   Any change that, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works and
Engineering, would constitute a significant modification to the provision of
public utilities to the subject property;
      J.   Any replacement of a sign or an expansion to a sign that is more
than 10 percent larger in gross surface area than a sign approved as part of a
final development plan. Increases in the gross surface area may be made only
once per sign in a planned unit development or planned residential development
to be considered a minor amendment. This subsection 12.11-A.10 shall not apply
to: (i) a replacement or an expansion to a sign that is consistent with sign
criteria approved pursuant to Section
9.05-F of this Code; (ii) signs that are exempt from Article
9 of this Code pursuant to Section
9.01-A; and (iii) temporary signs that do not require a permit pursuant to
Section
9.03 of this Code; or
      K.   Any change for which a variation, modification, or exception from
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would otherwise be required.
   2.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
12.11-A.1, the addition or replacement of a Building-Mounted Wind Energy System
(BWES), Solar Energy System, or Geothermal Energy System shall be deemed a
"minor amendment" that may be approved by the Village Principal Planner
provided that: (i) the Village Principal Planner makes a finding that the
amendment is consistent with the intent and purpose of the planned unit
development or planned residential development; and (ii) the addition or
replacement of the proposed Building-Mounted Wind Energy System, Solar Energy
System, or Geothermal Energy System does not require the approval of a
variation, modification, or exception from the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance.
12.11-B   Major Amendments
   1.   Proposed amendments that do not meet the criteria for minor amendments,
as provided in Section
12.11.A of the Zoning Ordinance, may be implemented only upon adoption of an
amendatory ordinance by the Village Board, which may be adopted only in
accordance with the review and approval procedures for planned unit
developments or planned residential developments, as may be applicable, and
following a public hearing by, and recommendation of, the Plan Commission, as
provided in Section
12.09-A through Section
12.09-F of the Zoning Ordinance.
   2.   An applicant for an amendment that does not meet the criteria for a
minor amendment, as provided in Section
12.11.A of the Zoning Ordinance, may request concurrent review of the
preliminary and final amended development plans. Nothing in this Section
12.11-B.2 shall be deemed or interpreted as obligating the Village to approve a
request for concurrent review of an amendment to a final development plan.
Either the Plan Commission or the Village Board may, in their discretion and at
any time, reject the request for concurrent review, and require separate review
of the preliminary and final amended development plans. If concurrent review is
authorized, the applicant shall submit for Plan Commission and Village Board
consideration all of the required documentation for a preliminary and final
development plan and, if applicable, a preliminary and final plat of
subdivision.
12.11-C   Expiration of Minor Amendment Approval
   An approved minor amendment to a planned unit development or planned
residential development is valid for 12 months from the date of the letter
granting such approval unless action to implement the minor amendment is
commenced within such time period and thereafter diligently pursued to
completion, including, if applicable, construction consistent with the minor
amendment as authorized by a building permit. If action to implement the minor
amendment, including construction, does not begin within the time set forth, or
does not proceed with reasonable diligence, then the approval will lapse and
become null and void.

unnecessary hardship in such a way as to prevent an owner from using his
property as intended by Ordinance. The term "variation" shall not apply to

County Assessor who paid the general real estate taxes for the last preceding

property for which rezoning is requested, except in those instances where the

street shall display two (2) signs, and one additional sign for each additional
two hundred feet (200') of street frontage thereafter. Where the Director of

less effective than a wall sign in providing notice to the public, the sign
notice provided herein can be placed in a window facing the street frontage of
the subject property.
   Content of Sign Notice.
   The sign notice provided by the Village and displayed by the Applicant shall
indicate that a public hearing is to be held concerning the property on which

   The Board of Zoning Appeals may recommend to the Board of Trustees the
granting of a variation when and only when, it shall have determined from
evidence presented to it, recorded in writing and placed in its records, that
all of the following conditions have been met:
   1.   Not a Use Variation
   That the variation does not permit a use otherwise excluded from the
particular district in which requested.
   2.   Unique to the Property
   That special circumstances or conditions, such as exceptional narrowness,
topography, or siting, apply to the land for which a variation sought and that
these conditions do not apply generally in the district.
   3.   Not Self-Imposed
   That the special circumstances or conditions have not resulted from any act
of the applicant subsequent to the adoption of this Ordinance, whether or not
in violation of the provisions thereof.
   4.   Not Exclusively Monetary
   That, for reasons fully set forth in the report of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of
a reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variation;
there must be a deprivation of beneficial use of the land.
   5.   Minimum Adjustment Necessary
   That the variation granted is the minimum adjustment necessary for a
reasonable use of the land.
   6.   Not Detrimental to Public Welfare
   That the granting of any variation is in harmony with the general purposes
and intent of this Ordinance, and will not be detrimental to the public welfare
or to other property or improvements in the neighborhood, and will not alter
the essential character of the neighborhood.
   7.   Not Detrimental to Neighborhood
   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent property, substantially increase congestion in the streets,
increase the potential damage of fire or endanger the public safety.
13.07-F   Conditions of Variation (Ord. 0-81-70)
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall recommend that such conditions and
restrictions be required upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be

of this Ordinance.
