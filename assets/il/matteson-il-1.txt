ORDINANCES
§ 30.40 ORDINANCES AND RULES TO EXECUTE POWERS.
   (A)   The Board of Trustees may pass all ordinances and make all rules and
regulations proper or necessary, to carry into effect the powers granted to
municipalities, with such fines or penalties as may be deemed proper. No fine
or penalty, however, except civil penalties provided for failure to make
returns or to pay any taxes levied by the village shall exceed $750 and no
imprisonment authorized in 65 ILCS 5/1-2-9 for failure to pay any fine, penalty
or cost shall exceed six months for one offense.
   (B)   A penalty imposed for violation of an ordinance may include, or
consist of, a requirement that the defendant do one or both of the following:
      (1)   Complete an education program, except that a holder of a valid
commercial driver’s license who commits a vehicle weight or size restriction
violation shall not be required to complete an education program under this
section; and
      (2)   Perform some reasonable public service work such as, but not
limited to, the picking up of litter in public parks or along public highways
or the maintenance of public facilities.
   (C)   A default in the payment of a fine or penalty or any installment of a
fine or penalty may be collected by any means authorized for the collection of
monetary judgments. The Municipal Attorney of the municipality in which the
fine or penalty was imposed may retain attorneys and private collection agents
for the purpose of collecting any default in payment of any fine or penalty or
installment of that fine or penalty. Any fees or costs incurred by the
municipality with respect to attorneys or private collection agents retained by
the Village Attorney under this section shall be charged to the offender.
   (D)   A low-income individual required to complete an education program
under this section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned
income tax credit under § 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the state earned
income tax credit under § 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be

(65 ILCS 5/1-2-1) (2000 Code, § 30.40)
§ 30.41 ORDAINING CLAUSE.
   The ordaining clause of ordinances shall be: “Be it ordained by the
President and Board of Trustees of the Village of
____________________________.”
(65 ILCS 5/1-2-2) (2000 Code, § 30.41)
§ 30.42 VOTE REQUIRED; METHOD OF VOTING.
   (A)   The passage of all ordinances for whatever purpose, and of any
resolution or motion to create any liability against the village or for the
expenditure or appropriation of its money, shall require the concurrence of a
majority of all members then holding office on the Board of Trustees, including
the President, unless otherwise expressly provided by this code or any other
act governing the passage of any ordinance, resolution or motion; provided
that, where the Board consists of an odd number of Trustees, the vote of the
majority of the Trustees shall be sufficient to pass an ordinance. The passage
of an ordinance, resolution or motion to sell any school property shall require
the concurrence of three-fourths of all Trustees then holding office.
   (B)   The yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the passage of
the designated ordinances, resolutions or motions and recorded in the journal
of the Board. In addition, the Board of Trustees at any meeting may by
unanimous consent take a single vote by yeas and nays on the several questions
of the passage of any two or more of the designated ordinances, orders,
resolutions or motions placed together for voting purposes in a single group,
which single vote shall be entered separately in the journal under the
designation “omnibus vote”, and in such event the Clerk may enter the words
“omnibus vote” or “consent agenda” in the journal in each case in lieu of
entering the names of the members of the Board voting “yea” and of those voting
“nay” on the passage of each of the designated ordinances, orders, resolutions
and motions included in such omnibus group or consent agenda. The taking of
such single or omnibus vote and such entries of the words “omnibus vote” or
“consent agenda” in the journal shall be a sufficient compliance with the
requirements of this section to all intents and purposes and with like effect
as if the vote in each case had been taken separately by yeas and nays on the
question of the passage of each ordinance, order, resolution and motion
included in such omnibus group, and separately recorded in the journal.
   (C)   Likewise, the yeas and nays shall be taken upon the question of the
passage of any other resolution or motion at the request of any Trustee and
shall be recorded in the journal.

   All resolutions and motions which create any liability against the village
or which provide for the expenditure or appropriation of its money, or to sell
any village or school property, and all ordinances passed by the Board of
Trustees, shall be deposited with the Clerk. Except as provided in 65 ILCS 5/4-
1-1 et seq. and 5-1-1 et seq., if the President approves of an ordinance or
resolution, the President shall sign it. Those ordinances, resolutions and
motions which he or she disapproves shall be returned to the Board of Trustees,
with his or her written objections, at the next regular meeting of the Board
occurring not less than five days after their passage. The President may
disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in any ordinance, resolution or
motion making an appropriation, and, if so, the remainder shall be effective.
However, the President may disapprove entirely of an ordinance, resolution or
motion making an appropriation. If the President fails to return any ordinance
or any specified resolution or motion with his or her written objections within
the designated time, it shall become effective despite the absence of his or
her signature.

or making any appropriation, shall be printed or published in book or pamphlet
form, published by authority of the Board of Trustees, or be published at least
once, within 30 days after passage, in one or more newspapers published in the
village, or if no newspaper is published therein, then in one or more
newspapers with a general circulation within the village. If there is an error
in printing, the publishing requirement of this section shall be satisfied if
those portions of the ordinance that were erroneously printed are republished,
correctly, within 30 days after the original publication that contained the
error. The fact that an error occurred in publication shall not affect the
effective date of the ordinance so published. If the error in printing is not
corrected within 30 days after the date of the original publication that
contained the error, as provided in the preceding sentence, the corporate
authorities may by ordinance declare the ordinance that was erroneously
published to be nevertheless valid and in effect no sooner than the tenth day
after the date of the original publication, notwithstanding the error in
publication, and shall order the original ordinance to be published once more
within 30 days after the passage of the validating ordinance.
   (B)   Except as provided in 65 ILCS 5/1-2-4, no such ordinance shall take
effect until ten days after it is so published. However, ordinances
establishing rules and regulations for the construction of buildings or any
part thereof, or for the development or operation of camps accommodating
persons in house trailers, house cars, cabins or tents, where such rules and
regulations have been previously printed in book or pamphlet form, may by their
terms provide for the adoption of such rules and regulations or portions
thereof by reference thereto without further printing, or publication, if not
less than one copy of such rules and regulations in book or pamphlet form has
been filed in the office of the Clerk for use and examination by the public at
least 30 days prior to the adoption thereof.
   (C)   All other ordinances, resolutions and motions shall take effect upon
their passage unless they otherwise provide.
   (D)   Anything in this section to the contrary notwithstanding, any
ordinance which contains a statement of its urgency in the preamble or body
thereof, other than an ordinance relating to finance, appropriations or taxes,
adopted under 65 ILCS 5/8-1-1 et seq. may take effect immediately upon its
passage provided that the Board of Trustees, by a vote of two-thirds of all the
members then holding office, so direct. The decision of the Board of Trustees
as to the urgency of any ordinance shall not be subject to judicial review
except for an abuse of discretion.
(65 ILCS 5/1-2-4) (2000 Code, § 30.45)
§ 30.45 RECORDATION.
   The Clerk shall record, in a book used exclusively for that purpose, all
ordinances passed by the Board of Trustees. Immediately following each
ordinance, the Clerk shall make a memorandum of the date of the passage and of
the publication or posting, where required, of the ordinance. This record and
memorandum, or a certified copy thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of the
contents, passage and of the publication or posting of ordinances.
(65 ILCS 5/1-2-5) (2000 Code, § 30.46)
§ 30.46 REVISION.
   The President may appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Board
of Trustees, one or more competent persons to prepare and submit to the Board
of Trustees for adoption or rejection, an ordinance to revise the village

association has been approved by the Board of Trustees as a depository for
these funds. The Treasurer’s bond shall be an amount of money that is not less

the Board of Trustees the reasons for the removal, or if the Board of Trustees

disapproves of the removal, the officer thereupon shall be restored to the
office from which he or she was removed. The vote shall be by yeas and nays,
which shall be entered upon the Board’s journal. Upon restoration, the officer

§ 31.008 INDEMNIFICATION OF VILLAGE OFFICIALS.
   (A)   To the fullest extent permitted by the Constitution of the State of
Illinois of 1970 and all other applicable laws, the President and members of
the Village Board shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the
village from and against all liabilities, expenses of defense and
investigation, judgments and amounts paid in settlement which may be imposed
upon or reasonably incurred or paid by such official in connection with or
resulting from any claim made against him or her, or any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which he or she may be involved, by reason of
being or having been elected or appointed to the Village Board as such official
of the village and as a result of conduct, within the scope of the duties of
office, whether or not he or she continues to be such official at the time of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
   (B)   The indemnity provided for in division (A) above shall not extend to
any of the following:
      (1)   Any liability or cost with respect to any matter as to which such
official is finally adjudged to be guilty of bad faith or actual malice or
willful and wanton misconduct in the performance of the duties of such
official;
      (2)   Any payment, expense or cost arising out of a settlement of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding, unless:
         (a)   Such settlement shall be approved by the court having
jurisdiction over such claim, action, suit or proceeding, with express
knowledge of the existence of the indemnification provided hereby; or
         (b)   Such settlement shall have been made upon the written opinion of
the village’s Attorney or independent legal counsel to the effect that there is
no reasonable ground for any finding of bad faith or of actual malice or
willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such official and that the
anticipated cost of such settlement will not substantially exceed the estimated
cost and expense of defending such claim, action, suit or proceeding to a final
conclusion.
      (3)   (a)   Any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in
respect of which such official has failed to deliver notice to the village as
provided in this division (B)(3). NOTICE, for the purposes of this division (B)
(3), means a written notice signed by such official and identifying, in
reasonable detail, the particular claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and the date upon and manner in which such official first learned
of the pendency of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.
         (b)   It shall be sufficient delivery of the notice if the notice
shall be mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the village,
Village Hall, attention: President; provided such mailing takes place no later
than the first of the following to occur:
            1.   Twenty days after the date upon which such official first
learned of the pendency of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation; or
            2.   Twenty days prior to the date upon which any response to the
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is required by law.
      (4)   Any proceeding brought by the village or any liability or judgment
payable to the village itself; and
      (5)   The cost of independent legal representation in any such action,
suit or proceeding if the village offers or otherwise indicates its willingness
to provide a legal defense with respect to such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation.
   (C)   In the event the village shall not have employed independent legal
counsel to have charge of the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation or such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is asserted against both the village and such official, and such
official shall have reasonably concluded that there may be defenses available
to him or her which are different from or additional to those available to the
village (in which case the village shall not have the right to direct the
defense of such action on behalf of such official), legal and other expenses
incurred by such official shall be borne by the village.
   (D)   The foregoing rights of indemnification shall apply to any criminal
action or proceeding, if the indemnified person had no reasonable cause to
believe the conduct (which must be within the scope of the duties of office)
was unlawful. The termination of any action or proceeding by judgment or
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not of itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to best
interests of the village, and with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.
   (E)   The foregoing rights of indemnification shall be in addition to any
other rights to which such official may otherwise be entitled as a matter of
law.

procedures, constant maintenance of equipment and vehicles, inspection of all
buildings open to the public and continual recertification of emergency medical
personnel are some of the proactive activities that occur within the Department
regularly, before a fire or emergency call even occurs. These actions help to

protection of life and property within its legal jurisdiction. The Chief is
responsible for planning, directing, coordinating, controlling and staffing all
activities of the Department, for continuous and efficient operations, for the

the time of the hearing the violation has been remedied or removed;

$750 for each offense. When applicable, each day during which a violation is
permitted to exist shall be considered a separate and distinct offense.

provision in this code and is not paid after the village sends, mails or
otherwise delivers notice (unless a different period is stated elsewhere in
this code) to the person responsible for such fine, charge, penalty or payment
(the “responsible person”), the village may transfer such fine, charge, penalty
or payment to a private collection agency of the village’s choosing or to an

provision and may retain his/her job.
   (C)   Relatives of village employees who are not relatives of village
elected officials may be hired or employed by the Village of Matteson only

relative's job performance and may not recommend a salary increase for a
relative.
   (D)   If two village employees are currently in the same department and if
there is a supervisory/subordinate relationship, one of the two must transfer

his/her employment within 90 days of the date in which the two became
relatives. The choice regarding which employee shall leave, shall be made by
the employees. If there is an unwillingness to make a decision, the employee
with the least seniority shall be terminated, unless the Village Board
determines that the needs of the village demand otherwise.
   (E)   For purposes of this section and policy the term "relative" is defined
as the employee's spouse, civil union spouse/partner, dependent child
(biological, foster or step), father, mother, son/daughter (including step and
in-law), sister, brother, grandparent or grandchild.
(Ord. 4385, passed 4-1-2019)
APPENDIX A: POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
I.   PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village of Matteson, Illinois to prohibit
harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal
employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All
municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person,
regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof.
II.   DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a
sexual nature when;
   (1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment,
   (2)   Submission, to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
   (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes:
   • Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes
about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats,
repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside
of their presence, of a sexual nature.
   • Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene
gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, “catcalls”, “smacking” or
“kissing” noises.
   • Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing
pornographic material or websites.
   • Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the
body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
   • Textual/Electronic: “sexting” (electronically sending messages with sexual
content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language,
harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic,
communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings,
blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter).
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine.
On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and
depends, to some extent, on individual perception, and interpretation. The
courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a
“reasonable person.”
III.   PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following;
   • Electronic/Direct Communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in
the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/
his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending
behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are
needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
   • Contact with Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct communication
is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by
the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate
supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of
human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the
chief executive officer of the municipality.
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
   • Resolution Outside Municipality. The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding riling a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense, A complaint with the EE&C must
be filed within 300 days.
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said
or done, the date, the time and the place;), including, but not limited to,
written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated
regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality.
However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and
the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of
credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component
of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome.
IV.   PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS
No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency
or office Shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due
to a municipal employee's:
   1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy,
   2.   The provision of information related to or testimony before any public
body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this
policy, or
   3.   Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions
of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected activity
pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made
in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected
from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State
Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower
protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension,
demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an
employee who does any of the following:
   1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body
an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or other
State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in violation of a
law, rule, or regulation,
   2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting
an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or
regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State employee, or
   3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not
retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in
any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that
the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee, has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil
rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to
retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or
participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over
for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC may file a
retaliation charge — due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the
alleged retaliation.
V.   CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT
Any person who violates this policy will be subject to any and all other
discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment
agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining
agreement. Each violation may constitute a separate offense.
VI.   CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the
sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual
harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is
not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness
of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe
offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who
intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of
this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements.

reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from periodic
grab samples.

and applicable surcharges.
(Ord. 4107, passed 6-20-2011)
§ 51.136 BASIC USER CHARGES.
   (A)   The basic user charge is levied on all users to recover operation,
maintenance plus replacement (O, M and R) costs and shall be based on water
usage as recorded by water meters or sewage meters for wastes having the
following normal domestic concentrations:
      (1)   A five-day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 119 mg/l; and
      (2)   A suspended solids content of 168 mg/l.
   (B)   The basic user charge shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the annual wastewater volume;
      (2)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all works categories;
      (3)   Proportion the estimated O, M and R costs to each user class by
volume; and
      (4)   Compute costs per 100 cubic feet for normal domestic strength
sewage.

part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devised for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the village.

address, room number and telephone number of the official in charge of billing,
clearly visible and easily readable provisions to the effect:
      (1)   All bills are due and payable on or before the date set forth on

      (2)   If any bill is not paid by or before that date, a shut-off notice
will be mailed stating that if the bill is not paid within ten days of the
mailing of the notice, service will be discontinued for nonpayment; and
      (3)   Any customer disputing the correctness of his or her bill shall
have a right to a hearing at which time he or she may be represented in person

orally or in writing his or her complaint and contentions to the village
official in charge of sewer billing. This official shall be authorized to order
that the customer’s service not be discontinued and shall have the authority to
make a final determination of the customer’s complaint.

herein, service will be discontinued at the time specified, but in no event
until the charges have been due and unpaid for at least 30 days.
   (C)   When it becomes necessary for the village to discontinue sewer service
to a customer for nonpayment of bills, service will be reinstated only after

the County Recorder of Deeds a notice of lien. This notice shall contain the
legal description of the premises served, and the date when such amount became
delinquent.
   (B)   Prior to filing the notice of lien, the village must send notice to
the taxpayer of record informing him or her that the charges or rates have
become delinquent and that unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the
real estate.
   (C)   The failure of the village to record such lien or to mail such notice
or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right
to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as set forth in this chapter. All liens
shall run with the land.
   (D)   An administrative fee of $75 will be assessed for the filing of all
liens.

fountain except for fire purposes and for the use of the Fire Department in
case of fire, nor shall any person use in any way or take any water for private
use (drinking at public fountains excepted) except through a meter which shall
be furnished him or her by the municipality after he or she has deposited with
the Village Clerk an amount equal to the cost of the meter, connection and plug
wrench, which money shall be returned to him or her on the return of the meter,
connection and plug wrench in good condition. He or she shall then pay the
Clerk for water used through the meter at meter rates then in effect.
   (B)   No person shall willfully break, injure, mar, deface, interfere with
or disturb any building, machinery, apparatus, attachments or appurtenances of
the municipal water works, or any public or private hydrant, or any stop cock,
service plug, water or service pipe, or any part thereof; nor shall any person
injure or deposit anything in any service box or commit any act tending to
obstruct or impair the intended use of any of the above mentioned things,
without the permission of the Board of Trustees, Water Committee or some person
duly authorized to issue such permits, except in cases herein provided.
   (C)   No person shall make any excavation in any street, alley or public
ground for the purpose of laying water pipe or connecting to any water or
service pipe already laid without written permission from the Director of
Community Development; and only such persons as are authorized to perform such
work shall do the same.
   (D)   All applications for the introduction of water into any premises, or
for the extension of any water pipe, shall be made to the Director of Community
Development by the owner or some duly authorized person on printed blanks for
that purpose to be had at the office of the Director of Community Development.
The application will state fully and truthfully all purposes for which the
water is required. Should the additional use of water be required, the person
desiring the same must make a new application before such additional use will
be allowed. The applicant must subscribe to and agree to be bound to such rules
governing the use of water as may be in force at the time or may be passed from
time to time by the Board of Trustees. If there is no available objection
existing, the Director of Community Development will issue a permit authorizing
the Village Engineer to tap the main and insert a corporation cock for such
service, and place a stop cock and service box three feet inside of the curb
line on the same side of the street where the premises to be supplied are
located. No person, unless duly authorized by the Board of Trustees, will be
permitted under any circumstances to tap the main or insert a corporation cock
therein. Special permits must be secured from the municipality authorizing a
licensed plumber to insert the service pipe from the stop cock into the
premises.
   (E)   Whenever any premises becomes vacant and remains vacant for a period

authorized agent shall make a formal request that the water be turned on, at a
cost of $75, and the Director of Community Development shall cause same to be
done.
   (F)   Service pipes will not be permitted to go from one lot to another
along streets wherein mains are laid. Water must be obtained directly from the
mains in front of the premises adjacent, provided that one service may be used
to supply all parties occupying the same building. All service must be laid at
least three and one-half feet below the surface of the ground.
   (G)   No claim shall be made against the municipality by reason of the
breakage of any main, pipe, service pipe or cock, or for any interruption of
the water supply, or by reason of the breaking of the machinery or stoppage for
necessary repairs.
   (H)   Water will not be turned on into any house or private service pipe
except on order of the Director of Community Development, nor until all the
water fees or charges against the premises for which the supply is intended
shall have been paid. Plumbers are strictly prohibited from turning water on
into any service pipe except on order or permission from the Director of
Community Development, provided this rule is not to be construed to prevent any
plumber from admitting water to test pipes.
   (I)   No hydrant, except public drinking fountains, shall be placed within
the limits of any street which has an opening for which it can be used as a
source of domestic supply.
   (J)   Persons taking water must keep their service pipe, curb boxes and all
fixtures connected therewith in good condition and protected from frost at
their own expense, and must prevent all unnecessary waste under penalty of
having the water shut off.
   (K)   Hydrants, hose attachments or valves which the consumer may adopt for
obtaining water from the service pipe shall not be located as to be accessible
to persons living or occupying neighboring premises, or to the public, and the

members of his or her family to use water from his or her hydrants, faucets or
other devices, without first being assured by the Village Clerk that the proper
rate has been paid for the use of the same.

the point where it enters the building.
   (N)   Plumbers shall, within 48 hours after the completion of any work in
connection with the water works, make a full and complete return, on the back
of the permit authorizing such work, of the number of rooms in the premises and
of the contemplated use of the water therein, a complete list of the articles
and fixtures used, and whether it is the first introduction of service pipes
into the premises, an extension or repairs, or a thorough testing of the same.
The plumber must turn off the supply from such premises at the service cock,
and the water will not be turned on until after the report of the work is made.
The work certificate shall be okayed by the Water Superintendent, and approved
as in accordance with the rules and regulations herein prescribed.
   (O)   No plumber or other person shall make any attachment to any old pipe
or water fixture from which water has been shut off and the supply discontinued
without the party desiring such work done having made application for and
obtained a permit for the same; nor shall any plumber or any person make an
attachment or addition to any pipe or water fixture attached to the water works
to conduct water into adjoining premises or into stables, baths, water closets,
wash basins or for any purpose whatever, without having made application and
obtained a written permit from the Village Clerk for each and every separate
job of such modification in the water fixtures.
   (P)   All service pipes extending from the service cock to the inner line of
the building shall be copper.
   (Q)   The interior plumbing of any premises must be capable of withstanding
a pressure of 100 pounds to the square inch, materials and installation shall
be subject to the approval and inspection of the Plumbing Inspector. The owner
of the premises shall be subject to all damages due to the breaking of water
pipes within the premises.
   (R)   No excavation or trench in any public place must be left open
overnight unless the same is well guarded with proper barriers, and lights
placed thereon not more than 50 feet apart. Before filling the trench or
excavation, the earth must be well rammed under the main level with the top
thereof. Then the trench or excavation must be filled with layers of not more
than 15 inches in depth, and each layer thoroughly rammed or puddled to prevent
settling. The street or alley shall be left in as good condition as it was
previous to making the excavation, and all rocks, boulders, dirt and rubbish
must be removed immediately after the completion of the work. Should any
excavation in any street or alley be left open and unfinished for the space of
24 hours, or should the work be improperly done, the Water Superintendent shall
have the right to finish or correct the work, and the expense thus incurred

in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for
special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.032, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.032, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow arrow indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.032, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk
that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic
controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
   (D)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(3)(a) and (b) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly
marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (D)(3)(a) and (b) below, vehicular
traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to
make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection
to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked
stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on
the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then
before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication
permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown.
      (3)   (a)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and local
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (D)(1) and (2)
above. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle
in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the
right of way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
         (b)   In municipalities with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, after
stopping as required by division (D)(1) and (2) above, the driver of a
motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to a
green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds
because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the
arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle's size or weight, shall
have the right to proceed, after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic
facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign as required by §
70.041.
            (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.032, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone
shall not enter the roadway.
   (D)   Application. In the event an official traffic control signal is
erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of
this section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a
marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the
absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (E)   Motorman; streetcars. The motorman of any streetcar shall obey the
above signals as applicable to vehicles.

proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   “Don’t Walk” or upraised palm signal. No pedestrian shall start to
cross the roadway in the direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has
partly completed his or her crossing on the “Walk” signal or upraised palm
symbol shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the “Don’t Walk”
signal or upraised palm symbol is illuminated, steady or flashing.

lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify
accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he or
she shall obey all other traffic controls, and follow normal safe driving
practices.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.

AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM
§ 70.075 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This subchapter provides for an automated traffic law enforcement
system, which detects motor vehicles which fail to abide by traffic-control
signals at intersections under penalty of a fine, and a system of
administrative adjudication by which such detected infractions shall be
resolved.
   (B)   It shall be a violation of this subchapter for anyone to operate a
vehicle in disregard of a traffic-control device or to turn right on a red
light where it is posted “No Turn on Red”.
(Ord. 4248, passed 12-15-2014)
§ 70.076 DETECTION.
   As used in the subchapter, AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM means a
device within the village with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in
conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor
vehicles entering an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal
indication in violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/
11-306. The automated traffic law enforcement system shall not be used to
enforce speed limit regulations. The recorded images produced by the automated
traffic law enforcement system, which consist of either two or more
photographs, two or more electronic images of a video recording showing the
motor vehicle, shall capture and display images of the vehicle allegedly
violating traffic-control signals, together with the license plate on such
vehicle, and shall also show the time, date and location of the violation.
(Ord. 4248, passed 12-15-2014)
§ 70.077 SIGNAGE.
   Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system
must have a sign posted which is visible to approaching traffic indicating that
the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement
system.
(Ord. 4248, passed 12-15-2014)
§ 70.078 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor
vehicle entering an intersection in spite of a steady or flashing red signal
indicating a violation of § 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-
306, this shall be deemed a non-criminal violation for which a civil penalty of
$100 shall be assessed and for which no points shall be assigned by the
Illinois Motor Vehicle Code point system for license suspension to the owner or
driver of the vehicle. The village shall issue a written notice of the
violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be
delivered by first class mail within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of
State notifies the village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of
the vehicle, and in no event later than 90 days following the violation. Each
notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall
require a review of the associated recorded image by an officer or other
employee or agent of the Village Police Department empowered under this
subchapter to determine whether a red light offense has occurred or whether one
of the defenses enumerated below in §
70.079 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the
recorded image captures a violation of one of the foregoing provisions and that
no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered
vehicle owner in the manner provided for below. The Traffic Compliance
Administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and
other correspondence mailed to the alleged violator.
   (B)   Each notice of violation, which shall constitute evidence of the facts
contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall establish
prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the
defenses established in §
70.079, shall include the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States post office approved database;
      (2)   The registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the
violation;
      (3)   The violation charged, with specific reference to that section of
the village municipal code of ordinances allegedly violated;
      (4)   The location where the violation occurred;
      (5)   The date and time of the violation;
      (6)   A copy of the recorded images;
      (7)   The amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the
civil penalty should be paid if liability for the violation is not going to be
contested;
      (8)   A statement that the recorded images are evidence of a violation of
a red light signal;
      (9)   A warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty or to
contest liability within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of violation in
writing or by attending the administrative hearing is an admission of liability
and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered
owner or lessee of the vehicle in addition to the specified penalties for
failing to appear at the hearing or pay the fine in advance of the hearing;
      (10)   The date, time and place of the administrative hearing at which
the charge may be contested on its merits, a date that shall be no less than 15
days from the mailing or other service of the first notice of violation;
      (11)   A statement that payment of the indicated fine and of any
applicable penalty for late payment shall constitute a final disposition of the
violation; and
      (12)   The signature of the party reviewing the recorded images and
confirming that a violation took place.
(Ord. 4248, passed 12-15-2014)
§ 70.079 DEFENSES.
   The following are the only defenses available for an alleged violator
contesting his or her liability for a violation, which shall be weighed by the
Hearing Officer and shall only rebut the prima facie case established by the
notice of liability insofar as one or more of the following defenses are
established by a preponderance of the evidence:
   (A)   The motor vehicle or registration plates were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control of or in the possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, which may be demonstrated through the
submission of a certified copy of a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle
or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely
manner;

a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as part
of a funeral procession;

vehicle cannot be determined;
   (D)   The operator of the vehicle received a uniform traffic citation from a
police officer at the time of the violation for the same incident as captured
by the automated traffic law enforcement system and either paid such citation
or successfully contested said citation; and
   (E)   The vehicle was leased to another and within 60 calendar days after
the citation was mailed to lessor, lessor submitted to the municipality the
correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle identified in this notice
of violation at the time of the alleged violation, together with a copy of the

   (A)   No person shall drive a vehicle on any public street in the

the traffic and the use of the way or so as to endanger the life or limb or
injure the property of any person. Except where the speed limit is otherwise
posted, if the rate of speed of any motor vehicle operated on any public street
in the municipality exceeds 25 mph, such rate of speed shall be prima facie
evidence that the person operating such motor vehicle is running at a rate of
speed greater than is reasonable and proper, having regard to the traffic and

any person.

maximum is 30 mph;
      (3)   On Main Street, the maximum is 30 mph; and
      (4)   On all other streets and ways within the municipal limits, the

   (C)   The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable
maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed
when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going
around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling on any narrow or
winding roadway or when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or
other traffic by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speed shall be
decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any legal requirements
and the duty of all persons to use due care.

that has been reported as stolen and is not towable for some other specific
reason, the owner should be, when practicable, notified by telephone or other

vehicle may be towed if the owner permitted the tow to be made when the vehicle

registered name and address of the owner of the vehicle, and notice shall be
mailed as provided herein to the address furnished, though in no case will the

a vehicle to be towed as an abandoned vehicle shall have seven days after the
date of mailing or personal delivery of the notice to request, in writing, a
pre-tow hearing. Subsequent to this seven-day period, the vehicle may be towed,
if the owner has not filed a written hearing request within the seven-day
period, and any hearing rights under the provisions of this subchapter will be
deemed waived.
   (B)   Scheduling of pre-tow hearings. The pre-tow hearing shall be scheduled
for a date within 14 days of the mailing or personal delivery of the pre-tow
notice. The municipality shall not be required to delay towing longer than the
14-day period.
   (C)   Request for pre-tow hearings. Requests for a pre-tow hearing are to be
made in person to the office indicated on the notice. Requests for hearing by
persons who reside more than 50 miles from the municipality may be made by
mail. Forms for such requests shall be made available at the Police Department.
At the time of making the request, the owner will be provided a hearing date
and time by mail or in person, as the circumstances require.
   (D)   Appointment of Hearing Officer. The municipality shall choose an
officer or employee of the municipality to serve as Hearing Officer. In no case

decision to tow the vehicle. The Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
require the presence of the enforcement officer who initiated the proposed tow
or any other municipal personnel.
   (E)   Nature of hearing. The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the
rules of evidence shall not apply. The hearing will not be determinative of, or
adjudicate, any citation relative to any vehicle. After receiving all relevant
evidence, the Hearing Officer shall make a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the evidence as to whether towing of the vehicle is authorized
by the laws of the state or the ordinances of the municipality, with a specific
statutory or ordinance section cited in the decision. The owner shall be
provided a copy of the pre-tow hearing decision.
   (F)   Decision to tow and rates to be charged. If the preponderance of the
evidence supports towing and compliance with the provisions of this subchapter,
the Hearing Officer shall direct that the vehicle be towed, with any towing and
storage costs to then be imposed upon the owner. The fees to be charged for
towing and storage services shall be no more than the maximum rates set by the
Chief of Police pursuant to the provisions of §
72.29. The owner of the vehicle having had such a hearing may avoid the towing
by immediately removing the vehicle from the improper location to a proper,
lawful location and correcting any unlawful condition of the vehicle.
   (G)   Decision not to tow. If the preponderance of the evidence fails to
support towing of the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall direct that the
vehicle shall not be towed. The municipality shall furnish a copy of the
decision to the owner, who may place it inside the vehicle in a location
plainly visible from the outside, such as the dashboard or rear window. No
vehicle about which such a decision has been rendered shall be towed by the
municipality unless the circumstances under which the decision was rendered
have changed. If at some subsequent time the municipality shall wish to tow the
vehicle from the same location, it shall follow the same procedures required
for the towing of any other similarly situated vehicle.
   (H)   Reports and documents to be retained; contesting decisions. Originals
or copies of all notices, pre-tow hearing decisions, towing reports and any
associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The municipality or the owner may
contest the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.

officer making the delivery shall be noted in the Police Department records or
reports. The notice shall be on the forms provided in §
72.31, and shall be mailed or delivered within 24 hours of the tow, as provided
in §
72.26(B). In the event that the municipality has towed an out-of-state
hazardous or unlawful vehicle, inquiry by computer, telephone or letter shall

furnishing of the most current registered name and address of the owner of the
vehicle, and notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address
furnished.
   (B)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service
operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least
12 inches by 18 inches, indicating the opportunity and procedures for a hearing
to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form for which is set
out in §
72.31(A), shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public
transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing service operator
performs services for more than one municipality, the information for
contacting the various appropriate municipal offices can be listed in one such
sign, the format for which shall be substantially similar to the form set out
in §
72.31(A).
   (C)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or
personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle,
whichever occurs first; otherwise, the right to a hearing shall be deemed
waived. Requests for hearings by persons who reside more than 50 miles from the
municipality may be made in person or by mail received by the municipality
within the 15-day period.
   (D)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to
possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove the vehicle,
the owner or other person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his
or her identity, ownership of the vehicle, or his or her right to possession,
sign a receipt for the vehicle, and pay the amount currently owed for towing
and storage fees to the towing service operator. The Chief of Police is
authorized to promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof
necessary to establish these facts.
   (E)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates. The owner shall pay
fees to the towing service operator for towing and storage on police-ordered
tows at rates that do not exceed maximum amounts to be administratively
established by the Chief of Police and which may be revised from time to time.
The basic rates for such fees shall be shown in the form and sign concerning
vehicle release requirements set forth in §
72.31(A). However, nothing in this chapter is intended to prevent a competitive
towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates
for police-ordered or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum rates for
various services, the Chief of Police shall consider such matters as the
prevalent market rates in the area for the different types of vehicles, the
types of storage and area requirements for categories such as large trucks and
commercial vehicles, and the relative difficulties and amount of work required
to perform various types of towing operations. For particularly difficult or
unusual towing jobs, such as large or serious accidents, the Chief of Police is
authorized to allow towing operators to charge rates above those established
for normal situations. All special charges must be based upon the cost of
services provided, taking into account such matters as the human-hours and
equipment time required for the job. A towing service operator must fully
itemize in writing the details of such a billing at special rates for a
particularly difficult or unusual tow, and supply a copy of the itemized bill
to the owner and to the Police Department. Any special rates charged must be
customary in the towing industry in the area for the nature and extent of the
services provided. Every towing service operator and the Police Department
shall have available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any
special rate policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to
view upon request.

ordinance or statutory provisions to the contrary, any towing service operator
authorized to perform tows on behalf of the municipality must perform its
services subject to the provisions of this subchapter. However, the towing
company shall have the right to recover the reasonable value of its services
for police-ordered tows, which are not paid by the vehicle owner, from the
municipality. However, if a tow or the charge for a tow is found by a court to

dangerous dog.
   (B)   Designation of problem pet owner. A person shall be designated as a
problem pet owner when the Hearing Officer or the court having jurisdiction, at
the request of the Police Department, has conducted an evidentiary hearing,
heard and considered evidence pertaining to past violations of this chapter by
the person, and entered an order determining that the person has committed the
violations described in division (A) above and designating the person as a

Department seeks to be declared to be a problem pet owner may be impounded if
the Chief of Police or his or her designee determines that impoundment is in
the interests of public safety or the health and welfare of the animals. Upon
such a determination by the Chief of Police or his or her designee, an animal
control officer or police officer may require that all of the animals be held
in an animal shelter or a secure veterinary hospital until a hearing is held.
If all of the animals are not impounded prior to the hearing, the owner shall
comply with any and all requirements imposed by the Chief of Police, the animal
control officer or their designee for the confinement and care of the animals
pending the hearing. Any failure to comply with such requirement is a violation
of this division (D), and each day of noncompliance will constitute a separate
violation.

the Hearing Officer or the court having jurisdiction determines that a person
should be declared a problem pet owner, all animal licenses held by that person
will be immediately revoked, and it shall be unlawful for that person to

date of the entry of that determination. Further, upon the determination by the
Hearing Officer or the court having jurisdiction that a person is a problem pet
owner, the problem pet owner must immediately surrender all animals in his or

impounded at any time by a police officer or the animal control officer. If
such animal cannot be relocated safely to an entity licensed to handle the
dangerous animal in the sole discretion of the Chief of Police, the Chief of
Police may order the humane destruction of such animal. This section shall not
apply to properly zoned and constructed zoos, federally licensed exhibits,
circuses, animal refuges or licensed scientific or research laboratories.

kennel license shall obviate the necessity of procuring individual licenses for
said dogs, provided that any such dogs permitted off the owner’s premises must

      (1)   The subgrade shall be moistened just before the concrete is placed.
The concrete shall be placed in successive batches for the entire width of the
slab, struck off, mechanically vibrated and finished to a true and even surface
with floats and trowels. The final troweling shall be done with a steel trowel,
leaving a smooth, even surface. After the water sheen has disappeared, the
surface shall be given a final finish by brushing with a whitewash brush. The
brush shall be drawn across the sidewalk at right angles to the edges of the
walk, with adjacent strokes slightly overlapping, producing a uniform, slightly
roughened surface with parallel brush marks.
      (2)   The surface shall be divided by grooves constructed at right angles
to the centerline of the sidewalk. These grooves shall extend to one-fourth the
depth of the sidewalk, shall be not less than one-eighth inch and not more than
one-fourth inch in width, and shall be edged with an edging tool having a one-
fourth inch radius. No slab shall be longer than five feet nor less than four
feet on any one side, unless otherwise ordered by the Engineer. The edges of

not more than 50 feet in the sidewalk. Where the sidewalk is constructed
adjacent to pavement or curb having expansion joints, the expansion joints in
the sidewalk shall be placed opposite the existing expansion joints as nearly
as practicable. Expansion joints shall also be placed where the sidewalk abuts
existing sidewalks, between driveway pavement and sidewalk, and between
sidewalk and curbs where the sidewalk abuts a curb.
   (F)   Curing and protection. Curing and protection shall be in accordance
with Article 625.01.
   (G)   Backfill. After the concrete has been cured, the spaces along the
edges of the sidewalk shall be backfilled to the required elevation with
approved material. The material shall then be compacted until firm, and the
surface neatly graded.
   (H)   Disposal of surplus material. Surplus or waste material resulting from
the sidewalk construction operations shall be disposed of by the contractor, at
his or her own expense.

§ 100.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards, conditions
and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so determines.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to
regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare.

100.99
§ 100.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Director of
Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the application does not
conform to the requirements of applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and
regulations, the Director of Public Works shall reject such application in
writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the Director of Public Works is
satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter
and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, the Director of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
chapter.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4, a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans, specifications
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of
the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
ten days after service of notice to the village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case
of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
100.04, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) above.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007, 220 ILCS 5/21-100 et seq., shall be deemed
granted 45 days after submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by
the village, provided the holder has complied with applicable village codes,
ordinances and regulations.
(2000 Code, § 100.05) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 100.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(2000 Code, § 100.06) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008) Penalty, see §
100.99
§ 100.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
100.21. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(2000 Code, § 100.07) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008) Penalty, see §
100.99
§ 100.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)(a) and (A)(1)(b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X,” “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
         (b)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
         “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the village by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in
no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall
obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies
meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) above. A
utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under division (A) above, or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
above. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) above,
such as evidence that the utility is a “private self-insurer” under the
Worker’s Compensation Act, 820 ILCS 305/1 et seq..
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. (All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-“ or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A.M. Best Company.)

100.99
§ 100.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(2000 Code, § 100.09) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 100.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form.
      (1)   The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in the
form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to
the village.
      (2)   Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
division (B) shall, at a minimum:
         (a)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
         (b)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection
by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
         (c)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within
the state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals.
      (1)   The village, upon 14-days’ advance written notice clearly stating
the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this
division (D), may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day
notice period.
      (2)   Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
         (a)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
         (b)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due
and unpaid;
         (c)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
         (d)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the
village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the
Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) above.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) above.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(2000 Code, § 100.10) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 100.11 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Village right to revoke permit. The village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Noncompliance with this chapter;
      (3)   Permittee’s physical presence or presence of permittee’s facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee’s failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (B)   Notice of revocation or suspension. The village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this section.
   (C)   Permittee alternatives upon receipt of notice of revocation or
suspension.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the permittee shall have the following options:
         (a)   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause
exists for the revocation or suspension;
         (b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such
removal to the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
      (2)   The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend
the time periods provided in this division (C).
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A)
above.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) above, the village or its
designee may, at the option of the village: correct the deficiencies; upon not
less than 20-days’ notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or
equipment; or after not less than 30-days’ notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the village for all costs of
removal.
(2000 Code, § 100.11) (Ord. 3042, passed 2-19-2008)
§ 100.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER’S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-
of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or
the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village’s right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

§ 100.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Director of Public Works determines that
the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the
village’s utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or
maintenance of any of the village’s utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;

engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities
shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ICC’s
rules entitled, Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines (83 Ill.
Adm. Code Part 305);
         (b)   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:

maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility’s foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations (49 C.F.R. § 192.707).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

permission is obtained from the Director of Public Works.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility, at its expense, shall
remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility,
place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement,
sidewalk, and curbs.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair

as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Director of Public Works.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided

   (A)   Electric utilities - compliance with state laws and regulations. An
electric utility shall conduct all tree trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable state laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable state laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of Public Works
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility’s expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify
noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit.
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If
the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of
traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.

Public Works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Director of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Director
of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to
appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration
of the appeal at the Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at
least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely
decide the appeal.

activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in
writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75
days after the submission of a completed application.
            3.   The permit shall be deemed approved on the later of the
ninetieth day after submission of the complete application or the tenth day
after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of
the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the

structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            3.   The village shall document the basis for a denial, including
the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
village denies an application.
            4.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure
to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the village's review period.
            5.   The applicant must notify the village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the revised application.
            6.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the

discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for
the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the
application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which
incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for
consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate
permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits.
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or

wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         (e)   The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous division. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   (a)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole
or the electric supply zone of the pole.
         (b)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         (c)   For purposes of this division, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.

including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate placements.
         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions division, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose
that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this division.

on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in Village Zoning Ordinance.
      (10)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall

comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances

      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless

provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application

replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung

      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work

lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure

utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and
maintained consistent with the provisions of § 16-108.5(i) of the Public
Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/16-108.5(i)).

meaning given to that term in § 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/
3-105). Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to relieve any person from

applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after January 1, 2021, shall comply with this chapter.
      (2)   A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the village
on the effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the
village makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small
wireless facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the
collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application
submitted two or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying
the village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village
before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option
under this division.
   (G)   Annual recurring rate.

wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      (3)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if
it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.

§ 102.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Cook County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment

from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnity or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord. 4440, passed 1-19-2021)

expense, the following insurance:

activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
      (2)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
      (3)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless
provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds

which shall prevent the President from decreasing the number of licenses to be
issued within his or her jurisdiction.

supplied by the Village Clerk, which forms need not contain all of the
information required on an original application for initial license. Said
renewal applications shall, however, include a statement under oath by the
license holder requesting a renewal that there have been no changes whatsoever
in the circumstances of the renewal applicant or in the operation of the
subject business, which would change the answers to any of the questions
originally answered in the original application on file with the village. Such
form may require such additional information as the Liquor Control Commissioner
may deem necessary.
   (C)   Whenever there has been a change in circumstances in regard to the
renewal applicant or the operation of the business currently being licensed, a
new complete application shall be filed prior to issuance of a renewal of any
existing license. In the event that any license holder desires to apply for a
different classification of liquor license, such applicant shall be required to
complete and file a new complete application as if he or she were a new
applicant.

which begins with the thirty-sixth month before the franchise expiration,
commence a proceeding which affords the public in the village appropriate
notice and participation for the purpose of identifying the future cable-
related community needs and interests and reviewing the performance of the
grantee under the franchise. If the grantee submits, during such six-month
period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such
proceeding, the village shall commence such proceeding not later than six
months after the date such notice is submitted.
   (B)   Upon completion of the proceeding under division (A) above, the
grantee may, on its own initiative or at the request of the village, submit a
proposal for renewal. The village may establish a date by which such proposal
shall be submitted.
   (C)   Upon submittal by the grantee of a proposal to the village for the
renewal of the franchise, the village shall provide prompt, public notice of
such proposal and renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that
the franchise should not be renewed, and at the request of the grantee or on
its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding, after providing
prompt, public notice of such proceeding.
   (D)   The village shall consider in any administrative proceeding whether:
      (1)   The grantee has substantially complied with material terms of the
existing franchise and with applicable law;
      (2)   The quality of the grantee’s service, including signal quality,
response to consumer complaints and billing practices, but without regard to
the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the
system, has been reasonable in the light of community needs;
      (3)   The grantee has the financial, legal and technical ability to
provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the grantee’s
proposal; and
      (4)   The grantee’s proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-
related community needs and interests, taking into account the costs of meeting
such needs and interests.
   (E)   In any proceeding under division (D) above, the grantee shall be
afforded adequate notice and the grantee and the village, or its designee,
shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right
to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the
proceedings under division (A) above), to require the production of evidence
and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made of any such proceeding.
   (F)   At the completion of a proceeding under division (D) above, the
village shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for
renewal based upon the record of such proceeding and transmit a copy of such
decision to the grantee. Such decision shall state the reasons therefor.
   (G)   Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in
compliance with the procedures set forth above, shall be based on one or more
adverse findings made with respect to the factors described at divisions (D)(1)
through (D)(4) above pursuant to the record of the proceeding under said
division (D) above. The village may not base a denial of renewal on a failure
to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise or on events
considered under division (D)(2) above unless the village has provided the
grantee with notice and the opportunity to cure or in any case in which it is
documented that the village has waived its right to object.
   (H)   The grantee may appeal any final decision or failure of the village to
act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this section. The court
shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that any action of the
village is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this section;
or in the event of a final decision of the village denying the renewal
proposal, the grantee has demonstrated that the adverse finding of the village
with respect to each of the factors described in divisions (D)(1) through (D)
(4) above on which the denial is based is not supported by a preponderance of
the evidence, based on the record of the administrative proceeding.

§ 113.008 FRANCHISE RENEWAL IN THE EVENT OF CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW.
   In the event that any or all of the above-referenced provisions of federal
law are repealed, the following relevant section(s) shall apply.
   (A)   At least 24 months prior to the expiration of the franchise, the
grantee shall inform the village in writing of its intent to seek renewal of
the franchise.
   (B)   The grantee shall submit a proposal for renewal which demonstrates:
      (1)   It has been and continues to be in substantial compliance with the
material terms, conditions and limitations of this subchapter and its
franchise;
      (2)   Its system has been installed, constructed, maintained and operated
in accordance with the accepted standards of the industry, and this subchapter
and its franchise;

provide the facilities, services and equipment set forth in its proposal; and
      (4)   It has made a good faith effort to provide services and facilities
which accommodate the demonstrated needs of the community as may be reasonably
ascertained by the village through a public process.
   (C)   After giving public notice, the village shall proceed to determine
whether the grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations under the
franchise. To determine satisfactory performance, the village shall consider
technical developments and performance of the system, programming, other
services offered, cost of services and any other particular requirements set
forth in this subchapter. The village shall also consider the grantee’s reports
made to the village and to the FCC, and the village may require the grantee to
make available specified records, documents and information for this purpose,
and may inquire specifically whether the grantee will supply services
sufficient to meet community needs and interests. Industry performance on a
national basis shall also be considered. Provision shall be made for public
comment with adequate prior notice of at least ten days.
   (D)   The village shall then prepare any amendments to this subchapter that
it believes necessary.
   (E)   If the village finds the grantee’s performance satisfactory, and finds
the grantee’s technical, legal and financial abilities acceptable, and finds
the grantee’s renewal proposal meets the future cable-related needs of the
village, a new franchise may be granted pursuant to this subchapter, as
amended, for a period to be determined.
   (F)   If the grantee is determined by the village to have performed
unsatisfactorily, new applicants may be sought and evaluated, and a franchise
award shall be made by the village according to franchising procedures adopted
by the village.

§ 113.009 POLICE POWERS.
   (A)   In accepting a franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
thereunder are subject to the police power of the village to adopt and enforce
general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public; and it
agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and ordinances enacted by the
village pursuant to such power.
   (B)   Any conflict between the provisions of a franchise and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the village’s police powers shall be
resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such exercise that is not of
general application in the jurisdiction, or applies exclusively to the grantee
or cable television systems which contains provisions inconsistent with this
subchapter, shall prevail only if upon such exercise the village finds a danger
to health, safety, property or the general welfare or if such exercise is
mandated by law.

§ 113.011 USE OF GRANTEE FACILITIES.
   The village and the grantee shall work together to agree to terms and
conditions which allow the village to install and maintain upon the poles of
the grantee, any wire or pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with
the cable television system operations of the grantee, so long as the village
maintains a similar right with the utilities operating in the village. The
village shall indemnify and hold harmless the grantee from any claim that might
arise due to or as a result of the village’s use.
(2000 Code, § 113.11) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997)
§ 113.012 INITIAL FRANCHISE COSTS.
   Costs to be borne by a grantee shall include any requirements or charges
incidental to the awarding or enforcing of its initial franchise, but shall not

   (B)   Within 15 days after the award of a renewal franchise, the grantee

financial institution or a security deposit in the amount of $10,000 with the
form to be established by the village.
   (C)   The form and content of such letter of credit or security deposit
shall be approved by the Village Attorney. These instruments shall be used to
ensure the faithful performance of the grantee of all provisions of this
subchapter, and to ensure compliance with all orders, permits and directions of
any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the village
having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under this subchapter, and to
ensure the payment by the grantee of any claims, liens and taxes due the
village which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of
the system.
   (D)   The letter of credit or security deposit shall be maintained at the
amount established in division (A) above for the entire term of the franchise,
even if amounts have to be withdrawn pursuant to this subchapter.
   (E)   If the grantee fails to pay to the village any compensation within the
time fixed herein; or fails to pay to the village any taxes due and unpaid; or
fails to repay the village any damages, costs or expenses which the village is
compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection
with the franchise, the village shall provide the grantee with written notice
informing the grantee that such amounts are due to the village. The written
notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific reasons for the
assessment. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent to receipt of the notice
in which to pay the amounts the village has stated it is owed, or within ten
days of receipt of the village notice, notify the village that there is a
dispute as to whether grantee believes such amounts are due the village. Such
notice by the grantee to the village shall specify with particularity the basis
of grantee’s belief that such monies are not due the village, and shall stay
the running of the 30-day cure period pending a Board decision. The Board shall
hear the grantee’s dispute. The grantee must be given at least ten days’ notice
of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to the right to
present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. After the hearing,
the village shall provide the grantee a copy of its action, along with
supporting documents. In the event the village upholds the finding of
outstanding monies due the village by the grantee, the village may immediately
withdraw the amount thereof, with interest from the letter of credit or
security deposit.
   (F)   The rights reserved to the village with respect to the letter of
credit are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by
the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a
right with respect to such letter of credit shall affect any other right the
village may have.
   (G)   The letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement: “It is
hereby understood and agreed that this letter of credit or security deposit may
not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the
surety until 30 days after receipt by the village, by registered mail, of a
written notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew.”
   (H)   Upon receipt of the 30-day notice, this shall be construed as a
default granting the village the right to demand payment from the bank for
either the security deposit or letter of credit.
   (I)   The village at any time during the term of this subchapter, may waive
the grantee’s requirement to maintain a letter of credit or security deposit.
The waiver of the requirement can be initiated by the village or grantee.

§ 113.015 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (A)   Within 30 days after the award of an initial or renewal franchise, the
grantee shall file with the village a performance bond in the amount of
$100,000. This bond shall be maintained throughout the construction period, and
until such time as determined by the village, unless specified in the franchise
agreement.
   (B)   If the grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or resolution
governing the franchise, or fails to well and truly observe, fulfill and
perform each term and condition of the franchise, as it relates to the
conditions relative to the construction, operation or maintenance of the
system, including the franchise agreement that is incorporated herein by
reference, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally, from the principal
and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the village as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost
of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee, plus a reasonable
allowance for attorney fees, including the village’s legal staff, and costs, up
to the full amount of the bond. This section shall be an additional remedy for
any and all violations outlined in §
113.014.
   (C)   The village may, upon completion of construction of the service area,
waive or reduce the requirement of the grantee to maintain the bond. However,
the village may require a performance bond to be posted by the grantee for any
construction subsequent to the completion of the initial service areas, in a
reasonable amount and upon such terms as determined by the village.
   (D)   The bond shall contain the following endorsement: “It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety nor the
intention not to renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt by
the village, by registered mail, a written notice of such intent to cancel and
not to renew.”
   (E)   Upon receipt of a 30-day notice, this shall be construed as default
granting the village the right to demand payment on the bond.
   (F)   The village, at any time during the term of this subchapter, may waive
grantee’s requirement to maintain a performance bond. The waiver of the
requirement can be initiated by the village or the grantee.

required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the village during the
term of the franchise. The grantee shall immediately advise the Village
Attorney of any litigation that may develop that would affect this insurance.
   (C)   Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by
the village thereunder, shall be construed to or limit the liability of the
grantee under any franchise issued hereunder or for damages.
   (D)   Such insurance policies provided for herein shall name the grantor,
its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees as additional insured,
and shall be primary to any insurance carried by the grantor, and shall contain
the following endorsement: “It is hereby understood and agreed that this
insurance policy may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to
renew be stated by the surety until 30 days after receipt by the village, by
registered mail, of written notice of such intention to cancel or not to
renew.”

of tangible or intangible property, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and
unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent, service mark
or any other right of any person, firm or corporation, which may arise out of

its subcontractors or agents or the grantee’s failure to comply with any
federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation;
      (2)   Any and all liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, claims,

Commission, whether by the grantee or otherwise; excluding therefrom, however,
claims which are solely based upon and arise solely out of information supplied
by the village to the grantee in writing and included in the offering materials
with the express written approval of the village prior to the offering.
   (C)   Assumption of risk. The grantee undertakes and assumes for its
officers, agents, contractors and subcontractors and employees all risk of
dangerous conditions, if any, on or about any village-owned or controlled
property, including public rights-of-way and easements, and the grantee hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the indemnitees against and from any
claim asserted or liability imposed upon the indemnitees for personal injury or

maintenance or condition of the cable television system or the grantee’s
failure to comply with any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or
regulation.
   (D)   Defense of indemnitees. In the event any action or proceeding shall be
brought against the indemnitees by reason of any matter for which the
indemnitees are indemnified hereunder, the grantee shall, upon notice from any

         (b)   The grantee must make cable television service available to at
least 50% of the dwelling units within the service area within one year from
the date of the award of the franchise.
      (2)   The grantee, in its application, may propose a timetable of
construction which will make cable television service available in the service
area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case the said
schedule will be made part of the franchise agreement, and will be binding upon
the grantee.
      (3)   Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically
approved by the village, will be considered a violation of this subchapter for
which the provisions of either §§
113.039 or
113.047 shall apply, as determined by the village.
      (4)   In special circumstances the village may waive 100% completion
within the two-year time frame, provided substantial completion is accomplished
within the allotted time frame, substantial completion to be not less than 95%.
Justification for less than 100% must be submitted subject to the approval of
the village.
   (B)   Line extensions.
      (1)   In areas of the franchise territory not included in the initial
service areas, the grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to
the following requirements.
         (a)   No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. The grantee is
hereby authorized to extend the cable system as necessary within the village.
To expedite the process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision,
the village will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each
project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the
design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan.
Upon notification from the village that the first home in the project has been
approved for a building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three
months to complete the construction/activation process within the applicable
project phase.
         (b)   The grantee shall extend and make cable television service
available to every dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas having at
least 20 dwelling units planned per street mile, as measured from the existing
system, and shall make every effort to extend its system simultaneously with
the installation of utility lines, provided that it can enter into such joint
trench agreements on reasonable terms and conditions.
      (2)   In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of
service, the grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber
desiring service, an estimate of the grantee’s costs required to extend service
to the subscriber. The grantee shall then extend service upon request of the
potential subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or assurance of
payment satisfactory to the grantee. In the event the area subsequently reaches
the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be refunded
to the subscriber.
      (3)   In cases of new construction or property development where
utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall
give the grantee reasonable notice of such construction or development, and of
the particular date on which open trenching will be available for the grantee’s
installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided
at the grantee’s expense. The grantee shall also provide specifications as
needed for trenching. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring
service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner;
except that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or
vaults, and laterals within ten working days of the date the trenches are
available, as designated in the notice given by the developer or property
owner, then should the trenches be closed after the ten-day period, the cost of
new trenching is to be borne by the grantee. Except for the notice from the
developer or property owner of the particular date on which trenching will be
available to the grantee, notice provided to the grantee by the village of the
opening of a trench shall also satisfy the requirement of reasonable notice if
sent to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee.
   (C)   Serving additional areas. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent
the grantee from serving areas not covered under this section upon agreement
with developers, property owners, residents or businesses.
   (D)   Line extension policy. A grantee, in its application, may propose a
line extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the village
than as required above, in which case the grantee’s policy will be incorporated
into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the grantee.
   (E)   Violation. The violation of this section shall be considered a breach
of the terms of this subchapter, for which the provisions of either §§
113.039 or
113.047 shall apply, as determined by the village.

grantee’s annual proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to Federal
Communications Commission standards and requirements.
   (B)   Additional specifications.
      (1)   Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable television

structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense
whenever the village determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
thereby.
      (2)   Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for
use in serving the village are available for use by the grantee, but it does
not make arrangements for such use, the village may require the grantee to use
such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be
enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and
reasonable.
   (D)   Relocation of facilities. If at any time during the period of the
franchise the village shall elect to alter, or change the grade of any street,
alley or other public ways, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the village,

be responsible, shall defend and hold village harmless from any and all damages
to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the property surrounding any tree,
whether such tree is trimmed or removed.

   (G)   Upon service interruption of a subscriber’s cable service, the
following shall apply.
      (1)   For service interruptions of more than four hours and up to four

maintain the technical standards and quality of service set forth in this
subchapter. Should the village find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed
to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it, by
resolution, specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the grantee shall
make such improvements. Failure to make such improvements within three months
of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties
contained in §
113.047 are applicable.
   (P)   The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which indicates the
nature of each service complaint (excluding programming complaints) received in

the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify or sell the system, the
grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous,
uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances for a period not to
exceed six months. If the village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails

subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the
circumstances, for a period not to exceed three months after the franchise
agreement has terminated.
   (B)   If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the
system, the grantee shall cooperate with the village, new franchisee or
operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such
period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during
which it operates the system, and shall be entitled to reasonable costs for its
services until it no longer operates the system.
   (C)   If the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive days
without prior approval of the village or without just cause, the village may,
at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as
the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the village or a
permanent operator is selected. If the village is required to fulfill this
obligation for the grantee, the village shall be entitled to all revenues for
any period during which it operates the system and the grantee shall reimburse
the village for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the
system received by the village that are the result of the grantee’s failure to
perform.

and similar matters. The grantee will make good faith efforts to arrange for
one or more payment locations in a central location where customers can pay
bills or conduct other business activities.
   (C)   As subscribers are connected or reconnected to the system, the grantee
shall, by appropriate means, such as a card or brochure, furnish information

name, address and local telephone number of the employee or employees or agent
to whom such inquiries or complaints are to be addressed.
   (D)   When there have been similar complaints made, or where there exists
other evidence, which, in the judgment of the village, in consultation with the
grantee, casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the
village shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully
cooperate with the village in performing such testing and shall prepare results
and a report, if requested, within 30 days after notice. Such report shall
include the following information:

special tests;
      (2)   The system component(s) tested;

be required.
   (E)   The village may request that tests be supervised, at the village’s
expense, by an independent professional engineer or equivalent of the village’s
choice. The engineer shall sign all records of special tests and forward to the
village such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and
commending actions to be taken.
   (F)   The village’s rights under this section shall be limited to requiring
tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics
based on complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the
village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence
require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable
service.

§ 113.029 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   A grantee shall pay to the village a franchise fee in the amount
designated in the franchise agreement. Unless otherwise specified in the
franchise agreement, such franchise fee shall be the maximum amount as allowed
by law or such lesser amount as may be designated by the village.
   (B)   The franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any other tax or
payment owed to the village by the grantee and shall not be construed as
payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other state, county or local
taxes.
   (C)   The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be
payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the village within 30 days of the
end of each quarter. The grantee shall also file a complete and accurate
verified statement of all gross receipts as previously defined within 30 days
after the end of the quarter.
   (D)   The village shall have the right to inspect the grantee’s income
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be
payable under this subchapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take
place within 60 months following the close of each of the grantee’s fiscal

paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the village,
which notice shall include a copy of the audit report.
   (E)   If any franchise payment or recomputed amount, cost or penalty, is not
made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be
charged daily from such date at an annual rate of 12%. The grantee shall

village by reason of the delinquent payment(s).
(2000 Code, § 113.29) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997)
§ 113.030 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.
   (A)   A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or
in part, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either
legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest
in any person without the prior written consent of the village, except that any
financing arrangement, including, but not limited to, a mortgage or pledge,
shall not be deemed a “transfer” controlled by this section. The grantee may,
however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the
grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the
grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any
release of liability of the grantee. Any proposed assignee must show legal,
technical and financial responsibility as determined by the village and must
agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The village shall have
120 days to act upon any request for approval of a sale or transfer submitted
in writing that contains or is accompanied by such information as is required
in accordance with FCC regulations and by the village. The village shall be
deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to
consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within 120 days following
receipt of written notice and receipt of all necessary information as to the
effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public, unless the
requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer.
   (B)   The grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or
proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of
control of the grantee. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to
major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner
exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred
shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of
persons of 5% of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer or
acquisition of control of the grantee that is not conducted pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this subchapter shall make the franchise subject to
cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining
whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control,
the village may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling
party, and the grantee shall assist the village in such inquiry.
   (C)   The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and to
the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to
the terms and conditions of the franchise.
   (D)   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village shall not
be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to
substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.
   (E)   In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved
without the successor(s) in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise
agreement.

times, and the village shall have the right to inspect, where reasonably
necessary for the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps, plans and
other like materials of the grantee applicable to the cable television system,
at any time during normal business hours; provided where volume and convenience
necessitate, the grantee may require inspection to take place on the grantee
premises.

no more frequently than on an annual basis if so mutually agreed upon by the
grantee and the village:
      (1)   A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by
the grantee to the village;
      (2)   Periodic preventive maintenance reports;
      (3)   Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any
supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies;
      (4)   Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to
review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or complaints periodically;
and
      (5)   Periodic construction update reports including, where appropriate,
the submission of as-built maps.

shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this
expense.

system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable
companies for both construction and operation of the interconnection link.
      (3)   The franchisee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to
interconnect or the village may rescind its request to interconnect upon
petition by the franchisee to the village if it finds that the franchisee has
negotiated in good faith and has arrived at impasse with the operator or
franchising authority of the system to be interconnected, or if the franchisee
determines that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or
unacceptable increase in subscriber rates or that interconnection is
technically unfeasible.
      (4)   The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation,
regional interconnection authority or village, county, state and federal
regulatory agency which may be hereafter established for the purpose of
regulating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable

under this subchapter or otherwise, the village reserves the right to terminate
the franchise and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder in the
event of a substantial breach of its terms and conditions. A substantial breach
by the grantee shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Violation of any material provision of the franchise or any
material rule, order, regulation or determination of the village made pursuant
to the franchise;
      (2)   Attempt to evade any material provision of the franchise or to
practice any fraud or deceit upon the village or its subscribers or customers;
      (3)   Failure to begin or complete system construction or system
extension as provided under §
113.021;
      (4)   Failure to provide the services promised in the grantee’s initial
application as incorporated herein by §
113.004;
      (5)   Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from
the village; or
      (6)   Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise.
   (B)   The foregoing shall not constitute a major breach if the violation
occurs but is without fault of the grantee or occurs as a result of
circumstances beyond its control. The grantee shall not be excused by mere
economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers
or employees.
   (C)   The village may make a written demand that the grantee comply with any
such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant to the
franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of 30 days
following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action
has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the village may
place the issue of termination of the franchise before the Village Board. The
village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least 20 days prior to
the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to request such
termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given
of the meeting and the issue(s) which the Board is to consider.
   (D)   The Village Board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear
any person interested therein and any relevant evidence, and shall determine
whether or not any violation by a grantee has occurred, after affording grantee
rights of due process to be heard and an opportunity to present all relevant
evidence and witnesses. The grantee may, at its own expense, make a transcript
of any such hearing.
   (E)   If the Village Board determines that the violation by the grantee was
the fault of the grantee and within its control, the Board may, by resolution
declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be forfeited and terminated
unless there is compliance within such period as the Board may fix, such period
to not be less than 30 days; provided, however, that no opportunity for
compliance need be granted for fraud or misrepresentation. Any such resolution
shall state with particularity the reasons for forfeiture and termination.
   (F)   The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed
upon the Board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance.
The Board may then terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the
grantee has failed to achieve compliance or it may further extend the period,
at its discretion.

§ 113.040 FORECLOSURE.
   Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of
the system, or upon the termination of any lease covering all or a substantial
part of the system, the grantee shall notify the village of such fact, and such
notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the
grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the franchise governing the
consent of the village to such change in control of the grantee shall apply.
(2000 Code, § 113.40) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997)

   The village shall have the right to cancel a franchise 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to take over and conduct the business of
the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of 120 days, or unless:
   (A)   Within 120 days after his or her election or appointment, such
receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of this
subchapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
   (B)   Such receiver or trustee, within the 120 days, shall have executed an
agreement, duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and
every provision of this subchapter and the franchise granted to the grantee.
(2000 Code, § 113.41) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997)
§ 113.042 COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of the franchise to the contrary,
the grantee shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the
state and federal government or any administrative agencies thereof; provided,
however, if any such state or federal law or regulation shall require the
grantee to perform any service, or shall permit the grantee to perform any
service, or shall prohibit the grantee from performing any service, in conflict
with the terms of the franchise or of any law or regulation of the village,
then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall notify
the village of the point of conflict believed to exist between such regulation
or law and the laws or regulations of the village or the franchise.
   (B)   If the village determines that a material provision of this subchapter
is affected by any subsequent action of the state or federal government, the
village and the grantee shall negotiate to modify any of the provisions herein
to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and
purpose of this agreement.

   (B)   Penalties and charges to tenants for service prohibited. Neither the

expressed, written consent of both the grantee and the village, any cable

prohibit a person from requiring that cable television system facilities
conform to laws and regulations and reasonable conditions necessary to protect
safety, functioning, appearance and value of premises or the convenience and
safety of persons or property.
   (E)   Risks assumed by grantee. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit a

agents or representatives for damages or from liability for damages caused by
the installation, operation, maintenance or removal of cable television
facilities.

(2000 Code, § 113.45) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997)
§ 113.046 THEFT OF SERVICES AND TAMPERING.
   (A)   No person may intentionally do any of the following:
      (1)   Obtain or attempt to obtain cable television service from a company
by trick, artifice, deception, use of an illegal device or illegal decoder or
other fraudulent means with the intent to deprive that company of any or all
lawful compensation for rendering each type of service obtained. The intent
required for a violation of this division (A)(1) may be inferred from the
presence on the property and in the actual possession of the defendant of a
device not authorized by the cable television company, the major purpose of
which is to permit reception of cable television services without payment. This
inference is rebutted if the defendant demonstrates that he or she or she
purchased that device for a legitimate use;
      (2)   Give technical assistance or instruction to any person in obtaining
or attempting to obtain any cable television service without payment of all
lawful compensation to the company providing that service. This division (A)(2)
does not apply if the defendant demonstrates that the technical assistance or
instruction was given or the installation of the connection, descrambler or
receiving device was for a legitimate use;
      (3)   Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical,
mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or
other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the
purpose of distributing cable television service to any other dwelling unit
without authority from a cable television company;
      (4)   Make or maintain a connection, whether physical, electrical,
mechanical, acoustical or by other means, with any cables, wires, components or
other devices used for the distribution of cable television services for the
purpose of obtaining cable television service without payment of all lawful
compensation to the company providing the service. The intent required for a
violation of this division (A)(4) may be inferred from proof that the cable
service to the defendant’s residence or business was connected under a service
agreement with the defendant and has been disconnected by the cable television
company and that thereafter there exists in fact a connection to the cable
system at the defendant’s residence or business;
      (5)   Make or maintain any modification or alteration to any device
installed with the authorization of a cable television company for the purpose
of intercepting or receiving any program or other service carried by that
company which that person is not authorized by that company to receive. The
intent required for a violation of this division (A)(5) may be inferred from
proof that, as a matter of standard procedure, the cable television company
places written warning labels on its converters or decoders explaining that the
tampering with the device is a violation of law and that the converter or
decoder is found to have been tampered with, altered or modified so as to allow
the reception or interception of programming carried by the cable television
company without authority to do so. The trier of fact may also infer that a
converter or decoder has been altered or modified from proof that the cable
television company, as a matter of standard procedure, seals the converters or
decoders with a label or mechanical device, that the seal was shown to the
customer upon delivery of the decoder and that the seal has been removed or
broken. The inferences under this division (A)(5) are rebutted if the cable
television company cannot demonstrate that the intact seal was shown to the
customer;
      (6)   Possess without authority any device or printed circuit board
designed to receive from a cable television system any cable television
programming or services offered for sale over that cable television system,
whether or not the programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or
otherwise made unintelligible, or perform or facilitate the performance of any
of the acts under divisions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above with the intent that
that device or printed circuit be used to receive that cable television
company’s services without payment. Intent to violate this division (A)(6) for
direct or indirect commercial advantage or private financial gain may be
inferred from proof of the existence on the property and in the actual
possession of the defendant of a device if the totality of circumstances,
including quantities or volumes, indicates possession for resale; and
      (7)   Manufacture, import into this state, distribute, publish,
advertise, sell, lease or offer for sale or lease any device, printed circuit
board or any plan or kit for a device or for a printed circuit designed to
receive the cable television programming or services offered for sale over a
cable television system from a cable television system, whether or not the
programming or services are encoded, filtered, scrambled or otherwise made
unintelligible, with the intent that the device, printed circuit, plan or kit
be used for the reception of that company’s services without payment. The
intent required for a violation of this division (A)(7) may be inferred from
proof that the defendant has sold, leased or offered for sale or lease any
device, printed circuit board, plan or kit for a device or for a printed
circuit board in violation of this division (A)(7) and during the course of the
transaction for sale or lease the defendant expressly states or implies to the
buyer that the product will enable the buyer to obtain cable television service
without charge.
   (B)   Civil liability for theft of cable television service.
      (1)   Any person who incurs injury as a result of a violation of §
113.999 may bring a civil action against the person who committed the
violation.
      (2)   If the person who incurs the loss prevails against a person who
committed the violation wilfully and for the purpose of commercial advantage or
prevails against a person who has committed more than one violation of §
113.999, the court may grant the prevailing party any or all the following:
         (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(2)(e), not more than $10,000
per violation;
         (b)   Actual damages;
         (c)   Any profits of the violators that are attributable to the
violation and that are not taken into account in determining the amount of
actual damages under division (B)(2)(b) above;
         (d)   Notwithstanding the limitations under the Illinois Compiled
Statutes, costs, disbursement and reasonable attorney fees; and
         (e)   If the court finds that the violation was committed wilfully and
for the purpose of commercial advantage, the court may increase the amount
granted under division (B)(2)(a) above not to exceed $50,000 per violation.
      (3)   If damages under division (B)(2)(c) above are requested, the party
who committed the violation shall be required to provide information on the
violator’s gross revenues, the violator’s deductible expenses and the elements
of profit attributable to factors other than the violation.
      (4)   In addition to other remedies available under this section, the
courts may grant the injured party a temporary or permanent injunction.
(2000 Code, § 113.46) (Ord. 1678, passed 7-21-1997) Penalty, see §
113.999
§ 113.047 PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Whenever the village believes that the grantee has violated one or
more terms, conditions or provisions of the franchise, and wishes to impose
monetary penalties, a written notice shall be given to the grantee informing it
of such alleged violation or liability. The written notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the grantee an
opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee shall have 30 days subsequent
to receipt of the notice in which to correct the violation before the village
may impose penalties unless the violation is of such a nature so as to require
more than 30 days and the grantee proceeds diligently within the 30 days to
correct the violation. In any case where the violation is not cured within 60
days of notice from the village, or such other time as the grantee and the
village may mutually agree to, the village may proceed to impose liquidated
damages.
   (B)   The grantee may, within ten days of receipt of notice, notify the
village that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in
fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the village shall specify with
particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the running of
the 30-day cure period pending Board decision as required below. The Board
shall hear the grantee’s dispute, the grantee must be given at least five days
notice of the hearing. At the hearing, the grantee shall be entitled to the
right to present evidence and the right to be represented by counsel. After the
hearing, the village shall provide grantee a copy of its action, along with
supporting documents. In the event the village upholds the finding of a
violation, the grantee shall have 30 days subsequent, or such other time period
as the grantee and the village mutually agree, to correct the violation.
   (C)   The rights reserved to the village under this section are in addition
to all other rights of the village whether reserved by this subchapter or
authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right
with respect to penalties shall affect any other right the village may have.

§ 113.062 MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEE.
   (A)   A village telecommunication infrastructure maintenance fee is hereby
imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of 1.0% of all
gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses
within the village for telecommunications originating or received in the
village.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this subchapter, the village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the village by telecommunications retailer.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this subchapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (C)   The village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this subchapter shall be collected, enforced and administered as
set forth in §
113.063.

§ 113.063 COLLECTION, ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF VILLAGE FEES.
   (A)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the village infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer’s service address.
   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to

the telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the
village infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself for
expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   (C)   Remittance of the municipal infrastructure maintenance fee to the
village shall be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the
Village Administrator, which shall contain such information as the Village
Administrator may reasonably require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this subchapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by
such telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the village. The charge imposed under division
(A) above by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this subchapter shall
constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this subchapter, whether
as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this subchapter, from telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the Village Administrator may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit.

220 ILCS 5/9-222 and 220 ILCS 5/9-222.1.
   (G)   (1)   The village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit
the books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this
subchapter to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly
accounted to the village for the village infrastructure maintenance fee.
      (2)   Any underpayment of the amount of the village infrastructure
maintenance fee due to the village by the telecommunications retailer shall be
paid to the village plus 5% of the total amount of the underpayment determined
in an audit.
      (3)   If the audit indicates that the underpayment was more than 3% of
the amount remitted to the village in a timely manner as provided in this
subchapter, then the telecommunication retailer shall reimburse the village for
any costs incurred by the village in conducting the audit. Any amount payable
to the village pursuant to this division (G) shall be paid to the village
within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.
   (H)   The Village Administrator, or his or her designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement
of this subchapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from
time to time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are
registered pursuant to §

standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;

standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or

exhibition of the genitals; and

scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the

or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;

ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

or other promotion of the material; and

   (D)   Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or
possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially
adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three
copies of obscene material shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to
disseminate.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age; and
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Findings. The President and Board of Trustees of the village hereby
find the following:
      (1)   Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing
development for certain non-agricultural uses including, but not limited to,
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants,
the building of roads and highways, and the creation of recreational
facilities;
      (2)   The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision
and reducing traction of road vehicles;
      (3)   Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys, washed-
out fills and embankments;
      (4)   Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to
pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs;
      (5)   Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and
      (6)   Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting in
increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety.
   (B)   Purpose. The President and Board of Trustees of the village therefore
declare that the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect
property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by
guiding, regulating and controlling the design, constructions, use and
maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the
topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth or land situated in the
village.

§ 153.03 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by development activities in the village. Measures taken
to control erosion and sedimentation should be adequate to assure that sediment
is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year frequency or
less.
   (B)   The following principles shall apply to all development activities
within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under §
153.18.
      (1)   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the
site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible,
and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.
      (2)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever
possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left
undisturbed wherever possible.
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the
shortest practical time during development.
      (4)   Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps or
filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from run-off
waters from land undergoing development.
      (5)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should
be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
      (6)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
      (7)   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased run-off
caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
Drainage ways should be designed so that their final gradients and the
resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion.
      (8)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as
practical during development.
(2000 Code, § 154.03) (Ord. 1141, passed 5-17-1982)

§ 153.38 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   The Director of Community Development or the Village Engineer
shall make inspections as hereinafter required and shall either approve that
portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work
fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sedimentation control
plan as approved. Plans for grading, stripping, excavating and filling work
bearing the stamp of approval of the Director of Community Development shall be
maintained at the site during progress of the work.
      (2)   In order to obtain inspections, the permittee shall notify the
Director of Community Development at least two full working days before the
completion of:
         (a)   Stripping and clearing;
         (b)   Rough grading;
         (c)   Final grading; and
         (d)   Final landscaping.
   (B)   If stripping, clearing, grading or landscaping are to be done in

permittee may continue work at his or her own risk, without presuming
acceptance by the village. Notification of the results of the inspection shall
be given in writing at the site.
(2000 Code, § 154.38) (Ord. 1141, passed 5-17-1982)
§ 153.39 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS.
   (A)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the Director of
Community Development, or the Village Engineer determines by inspection that
the nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing
permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage
structure, the Director of Community Development, or the Village Engineer may
require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
special precautions be taken as is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood
of such peril. Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, a
more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of plant materials for
erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer or
engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
   (B)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on
any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the Director of
Community Development, or the Village Engineer, may specify the time of
starting grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

(2000 Code, § 155.006) (Ord. 876, passed 8-4-1975; Ord. 1169, passed 2-7-1983;
Ord. 3020, passed 6-18-2007; Ord. 4086, passed 1-3-2011)
§ 154.007 DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES OR PAYMENTS OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF.
   (A)   Findings. The President and Board of Trustees hereby find the
following:
      (1)   During the past few years, the village has experienced a population
increase due principally to the development of vacant lots, annexation of
additional land and the subdivision of vacant land within the jurisdiction of
the village;
      (2)   The village has found that productive community life depends in a
great part on the availability of adequate school facilities to serve the new
development;
      (3)   The village adopted Ord. 1669 on May 19, 1997, to establish a
specific requirement for the dedication of school grounds or the payment of
fees in lieu of dedication, and that ordinance requires a periodic update to
ensure consistency with current land development and school needs;
      (4)   It is hereby found and determined that the public interest,
convenience, health, welfare and safety require the establishment of school
ground within the village generally in accordance with the following criteria
which is consistent with the minimum site recommendations of the office of the
State Superintendent of Education and Elementary School Districts No. 159 and
No. 162, and Rich Township High School District No. 227 (hereinafter “School
Districts”) operating within the jurisdiction of the village:
         (a)   Six hundred capacity elementary schools (K-5) on 11 acres of
useable land;
         (b)   Nine hundred capacity junior high schools (6-8) on 29 acres of
useable land; and
         (c)   One thousand five hundred capacity high schools (9-12) on 45
acres of useable land.
      (5)   Demographic studies of the residential portion of a proposed
subdivision or planned unit development can be readily and scientifically
conducted to determine the number of elementary and secondary school age
children and adults typically to be generated therefrom, and provide a method
whereby the required dedications of land directly attributable to the activity
of the subdivider, developer or builder and the proposed subdivision or planned
development may be calculated; and
      (6)   It is found and determined that the location of the school grounds
to serve the immediate and future needs of residents and children of each new
development is as essential to proper land development as are streets, water,
sewers and sidewalks, and to that end the village has determined that the
dedication of land for school grounds or cash contributions in lieu of actual
land dedication (where the latter is deemed impractical) or a combination of
both, shall be required of each residential builder or each developer of a
residential subdivision or a planned residential development.
   (B)   Indemnity agreement required. This section shall be applicable only to
those school districts with a valid and enforceable indemnity agreement which
will hold the village harmless for any complaints arising out of the
implementation of this section.
   (C)   Condition of approval. The provisions of this section shall be a
condition of the approval of a final plat of subdivision or approval of a final
plat of a planned residential development, or approval of a building permit on
a parcel of land within an already approved subdivision (provided the developer
of said subdivision has not already paid a fee or donated land for school
grounds). Each applicant, builder, subdivider or developer will be required to
dedicate land for school grounds to serve the immediate and future needs of the
residents of the development, or make a cash contribution in lieu of actual
land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village, in
accordance with the following criteria and formula.
      (1)   Criteria for requiring school grounds dedication.
         (a)   Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of
students to be generated by a subdivision or planned residential development
shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school
grounds. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the
ratio of: estimated children to be served in each such school classification
from the development over the maximum recommended number of students to be
served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying
such ratio to said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of
each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be
the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school grounds to
serve the estimated increase in the number of children in each such school
classification.
         (b)   School classification and size of school grounds. Classification
and size of school grounds within the village shall be determined in accordance
with the following criteria:
 
                           Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Useable
School Type/Grades         for Each Such School       Acres of Land for School
                           Classification             Grounds for Each Such
                                                      Classification
Elementary schools, grades 600 students               11 acres
K-5
Junior high schools,       900 students               29 acres
grades 6-8
High schools, grades 9-12  1,500 students             45 acres
 
         (c)   Location. Standards adopted by the affected School District
shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
      (2)   Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of school grounds.
Where the development is small and the potential dedication of school grounds
are too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for
school grounds, the village shall require the builder, subdivider or developer
to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash
contributions in lieu of school grounds shall be held in trust by the School
District for use in the acquisition of land to serve the immediate or future
needs of children from the subdivision or development or for site improvements,
which include school buildings or other infrastructure necessitated and
specifically and uniquely attributed to the development or subdivision in
question.
         (a)   Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall
be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved in
accordance with all applicable village regulations for subdivisions or planned
residential developments that otherwise would have been dedicated as school
grounds. It has been determined that the present fair market value of such
improved land in and surrounding the village is $90,000 per acre and such
figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless changed by the
President and Board of Trustees by a motion specifically referring to this
division (C)(2)(a), or unless a subdivider or a developer files a written
objection thereto. In the event of any objection, the fair market value of such
improved land shall be determined in the following manner:
            1.   At the sole cost of the developer, each of the following shall
name an appraiser who shall make an appraisal of the fair market value of such
acres of land on behalf of the village: the Village President and Board of
Trustees; the School District; and the developer;
            2.   All appraisers shall be MAI appraisers who shall issue bona
fide appraisals of the fair market value of the land in question; and
            3.   The final determination of the “fair market value” shall be
the average of the two appraisals which give the highest land value.
         (b)   Density formula.
            1.   Division (C)(2)(c) below establishes the population density
formulas which are generally indicative of current and short-range projected
trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the
amount of required dedication of acres of land or cash contribution in lieu
thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or
developer.
            2.   The School District shall submit to the President and Board of
Trustees for their approval, not less than once every five years, revised
population density formulas. Upon their approval, the calculations in division
(C)(2)(c) below shall be revised.
         (c)   Contribution in lieu of school grounds and density formula.

      (3)   Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee.
         (a)   There will be situations in subdivisions or planned residential
developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu
of land are both necessary.
         (b)   These occasions will arise when:
            1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school grounds. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the school location shall be dedicated; and
            2.   A major part of the school grounds has already been acquired
and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the
grounds. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
      (4)   Objections to density formula. In the event an applicant, builder,
subdivider or developer files a written objection to the population density
formulas listed herein, he or she shall submit his or her own demographic study
showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the
subdivision or planned residential development and in that event final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculation shall be
made by the Village Board of Trustees based upon such demographic information
submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be
submitted to the Village Board of Trustees by the school district, or others.
It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions
change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or
the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic
review and amendment if necessary.
      (5)   Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan of the
village calls for a larger amount of school grounds in a particular proposed
subdivision or planned residential development than the developer is required
to dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider’s or developer’s
contribution shall, if so determined by the Village Board of Trustees, be
reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated
by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the
date of approval of the final plat.
      (6)   Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on land dedicated for school grounds shall not differ greatly
from surrounding land.
      (7)   Improved sites. All school grounds shall be dedicated in a
condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets as
applicable to the location of the property, or acceptable provision made
therefor. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition of
improved grounds may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any
such school grounds and construction of school facilities thereon.
      (8)   Title to grounds. All school grounds shall be conveyed either by
warranty or trustee’s deed for the benefit of the School District and conveyed
directly to the School District. The subdivider or developer shall be
responsible for conveying good, merchantable title to such grounds, and shall
be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance,
including any agricultural roll back taxes which might be extended or levied
against such grounds for any tax years or periods prior to the time of
conveyance.
      (9)   Use of parcel. When, in the opinion of the School District holding
title to any parcel of land dedicated under this section, any such parcel has
become unnecessary or unsuitable or inconvenient, such parcel may be sold as
provided by applicable statutory authority, and the proceeds shall be held in

PROCEDURE FOR REVIEW OF PLATS
§ 154.020 DUTIES OF SUBDIVIDER AND PLAN COMMISSION.
   The prospective subdivider is urged to consult informally with the Plan
Commission and, where pertinent, county officials, state agencies and public
utilities, on the availability of services and public facilities in the area to
be subdivided. He or she is also encouraged to study the pertinent rules and
regulations, including the Zoning Code, Building Code and especially this
chapter. The Plan Commission is responsible for discouraging not only premature
development, but also development in unsuitable areas that are inaccessible or
hazardous or lack services. The Plan Commission is also charged with
encouraging replatting of inadequate subdivisions and coordinating the platting
of small parcels of adjacent land.
(2000 Code, § 155.015) (Ord. 876, passed 8-4-1975)
§ 154.021 STAGES OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   All subdivision plats shall be processed in three stages leading to
approval for recording, except that in instances as specified by this chapter,
certain stages may be waived or combined. The three stages are the sketch plan,
the preliminary plat, and the final plat and engineering plans.
      (1)   Sketch plan.
         (a)   The sketch plan is a sketch proposal, complying with the
provisions of §§
154.040 through
154.043, submitted informally by the developer to the Plan Commission.
         (b)   The purposes of the sketch plan and the preapplication
conference with the Plan Commission are to:
            1.   Develop cooperation and confidence;
            2.   Familiarize the developer with requirements;
            3.   Do away with major revisions of the preliminary plats;
            4.   Save the developer time and money; and
            5.   Provide assistance to small-scale subdividers.
      (2)   Preliminary plat.
         (a)   The preliminary plat is a drawing which shall be prepared
subsequent to and in accordance with the agreements reached in the sketch plan
conference. It shall be prepared in accordance with §§
154.040 through
154.043 and all other applicable provisions of this chapter and other
ordinances, and four copies shall be filed with the Director of Community
Development, together with an application form in duplicate.
         (b)   The Plan Commission shall approve or disapprove the application
for preliminary approval within 90 days from the date of the application or the
filing by the applicant of the last item of required supporting data, whichever
date is later, unless the time is extended by mutual consent. If the plat is
disapproved, then within the 90 days the Plan Commission shall furnish to the
applicant, in writing, a statement setting forth the reason for disapproval and
specifying with particularity the aspects in which the proposed plat fails to
conform to the ordinances, including the official map. If the plat is approved,
the corporate authority shall accept or reject the plat within 30 days after
its next regular stated meeting following the action of the Plan Commission.
Preliminary approval shall not qualify a plat for recording.
         (c)   If the plat is approved, the Director of Community Development
shall attach a certified copy of the order or resolution of approval to a copy
of the plat. If the proposed plat is disapproved, the order or resolution shall
state the reasons for the disapproval, specifying with particularity the
aspects in which the proposed plat fails to conform to the official map. A copy
of the order or resolution shall be filed in the office of the Director of
Community Development.
      (3)   Final plat.
         (a)   The final plat is a record of the subdivision as surveyed in the
field. It shows property lines and other dimensions important to the subdivider
in selling lots, and to the public in keeping records of street lines,
easements and utility locations.
         (b)   Application for approval of a final plat shall be made not later
than one year after approval of a preliminary plat has been granted. This
application must be supported by the drawings, specifications and bond as may
be necessary to demonstrate compliance with all requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   The final plat shall be prepared in accordance with §§
154.040 through
154.043 and all other applicable provisions of this chapter and other
ordinances, and the original and three copies shall be filed with the Village
Clerk, together with four copies of all required supporting materials and an
application form in duplicate.
         (d)   It is intended that approval by the Plan Commission and the
Board of Trustees be automatic if the final plat conforms closely to the
approved preliminary plat and approved engineering plans. Disapproval is
warranted, however, if:
            1.   There are more than minor deviations from the preliminary
plat;
            2.   More than one year has elapsed since the approval of
engineering plans; or
            3.   A new highway, pipeline or other major feature has been
constructed or has directly affected the site by virtue of the improvement
being included in the official map.
         (e)   When a person submitting a plat of subdivision or resubdivision
for final approval has supplied all drawings, maps and other documents required
by this chapter to be furnished in support thereof, and if all the material
meets all the requirements, the Village Board shall approve the proposed plat
within 60 days from the date of filing the last required document or other
paper, or within 60 days from the date of filing application for final approval
of the plat, whichever date is later. The applicant and the Board may mutually
agree to extend the 60-day period.
         (f)   If the plat is approved, the Village Clerk shall attach a
certified copy of the order or resolution of approval to a copy of the plat. If
the proposed plat is disapproved, the order or resolution shall state the
reasons for the disapproval, specifying with particularity the aspects in which
the proposed plat fails to conform to the official map. A copy of the order or
resolution shall be filed in the office of the Village Clerk.
      (4)   Engineering plans.
         (a)   Engineering plans are drawings, specifications and construction
cost estimates for all new construction of facilities in the development, and
shall comply with the provisions of §§
154.040 through
154.043.
         (b)   The engineering plans may be submitted at the same time as the
preliminary plat or at any time up to and including the date of filing the
final plat for village approval.
      (5)   Development in sections.
         (a)   The applicant may elect to have final approval of a geographic
part of the plat that received preliminary approval, and may delay application
for approval of other parts until a later day or dates beyond one year with the
approval of the Village Board, provided all facilities required to serve the
part for which final approval is sought have been provided. In such case only
the part of the plat as has received final approval shall be recorded.
         (b)   In no case, except for the final section, shall any section
filed for approval under this provision contain less than 50 residential lots.
   (B)   (1)   For the purposes of this chapter, a MINOR SUBDIVISION is defined
as any subdivision containing not more than ten lots fronting on an existing,
improved, public, minor street, not involving any new street or road or the
extension of municipal facilities, not adversely affecting the development of
the remainder of the parcel or adjoining property, and not conflicting with any
provision or portion of the official plan, zoning code or this chapter.
      (2)   Final plats for minor subdivisions may be submitted without going
through the preliminary plat stage.
(2000 Code, § 155.016) (Ord. 876, passed 8-4-1975; Ord. 1147, passed 6-7-1982)

§ 161.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the Board of Trustees to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the village and to ensure mortgagees, landlords, and
owners take responsibility to prevent and avoid nuisances in the village. The
purpose of this chapter is to identity foreclosing or foreclosed mortgages,
vacant property, and rental property in the village, to ensure that such
properties meet and maintain minimum building and housing code standards and
exterior maintenance standards. The Board of Trustees has determined that
requiring that all foreclosing mortgages, vacant properties, rental properties
be registered with the village and inspected serves these legitimate
governmental interests.

for the cost of temporarily securing the property, or of any abatement directed
