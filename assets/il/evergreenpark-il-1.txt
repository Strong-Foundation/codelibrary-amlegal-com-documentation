and rabies license tags. The examination for identification shall be done
within twenty-four (24) hours after the intake of each dog. The animal control
warden shall make every reasonable attempt to contact the owner as soon as
possible. The animal control warden shall give notice of not less than seven
(7) business days to the owner prior to disposal of the animal. Such notice
shall be mailed to the last known address of the owner. Testimony of the animal
control warden, or his or her authorized agent, who mails such notice shall be
evidence of the receipt of such notice by the owner. A mailed notice shall
remain the primary means of owner contact; however, the animal control warden
shall also attempt to contact the owner by any other contact information, such
as by telephone or email address, provided by the microchip or other method of
identification found on the dog. If the dog has been microchipped and the
primary contact listed by the chip manufacturer cannot be located or refuses to
reclaim the dog, an attempt shall be made to contact any secondary contacts
listed by the chip manufacturer prior to adoption, transfer, or euthanization.
Prior to transferring the dog to another humane shelter, pet store, rescue
group, or euthanization, the dog shall be scanned again for the presence of a
microchip and examined for other means of identification. If a second scan
provides the same identifying information as the initial intake scan and the
owner has not been located or refuses to reclaim the dog, the animal control
facility may proceed with the adoption, transfer, or euthanization.
   (d)   In case the owner of any impounded dog desires to make redemption
thereof, he or she may do so by doing the following:
      (1)   Presenting proof of current rabies inoculation, microchipping,
registration and licensure, if applicable;
      (2)   Paying for the rabies inoculation, microchipping, registration, and
licensure, if applicable; and
      (3)   Paying the pound for the board of the dog for the period it was
impounded.
   (e)   When not redeemed by the owner a dog must be scanned for a microchip.
If a microchip is present, the registered owner or chip purchaser, if the
purchaser was a nonprofit organization, animal shelter, animal control
facility, pet store, breeder, or veterinary office, must be notified. After
contact has been made or attempted, dogs deemed adoptable by the animal control
facility shall be offered for adoption, or made available to a licensed animal
shelter or rescue group. The animal may be humanely dispatched pursuant to the
Humane Euthanasia in Animal Shelters Act. An animal control facility or animal
shelter shall not adopt or release any dog to anyone other than the owner or a
foster home unless the animal has been rendered incapable of reproduction and
microchipped. Nothing herein shall prevent humane societies or animal shelters
from engaging in activities set forth by their charters; provided, they are not
inconsistent with provisions hereof. No animal shelter or animal control
facility shall release dogs to an individual representing a rescue group,
unless the group has been licensed by the Department of Agriculture or is a
representative of a not-for-profit out-of-state organization, animal shelter,
or animal control facility.

found to be a "dangerous dog" upon three (3) separate occasions, shall be

connection shall be provided with a village-approved checkvalve. Also adjacent
to and at the outlet side of the checkvalve, a village-approved pressure relief
valve set to relieve at five (5) psi above the maximum water pressure at the
point of installation shall be provided if the refrigeration units contain more
than twenty (20) pounds of refrigerants.
      (4)   Protection against backflow and backsiphonage:
         a.   A potable water system shall be protected against backflow and
backsiphonage by providing and maintaining at each outlet an air gap, as
specified below, between the potable water outlet and the flood-level rim of
the fixture it supplies or between the outlet and any other source of
contamination or an approved device or means to prevent backflow.
         b.   Minimum required air gap:
            1.   The minimum required air gap shall be measured vertically from
the lowest end of a potable water outlet to the flood rim or line of the
fixture or receptacle into which it discharged.
            2.   The minimum required air gap shall be twice the effective
opening of a potable water outlet, unless the outlet is a distance less than
three (3) times the effective opening away from a wall or similar vertical
surface; in which case, the minimum required air gap shall be three (3) times
the effective opening of the outlet. In no case shall the minimum required air
gap be less than one (1) inch.
      (5)   Before any device for the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage
is installed, it shall have first been certified by the Foundation for Cross-
Connection Control Research of the University of Southern California and the
National Sanitation Foundation. Devices, other than reduced pressure principle
backflow preventers, installed in a residential potable water supply
distribution system for the protection against backflow shall be maintained in
good working condition by the person responsible for the maintenance of the
system. Reduced pressure zone backflow preventers installed in a nonresidential
building potable water supply distribution system shall be tested and
maintained by a state-certified backflow preventer maintenance/tester in
accordance with section 653.802(d) of subtitle F, title 35, of the Illinois
Administrative Code, as adopted by the State of Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency, including any subsequent amendments thereto. The
commissioner routinely shall inspect such devices; and if they are found to be
defective or inoperative, the commissioner shall notify the owner of his
obligation to have the device repaired within seventy-two (72) hours of oral or
written notice. If the building owner does not perform the necessary repairs
within seventy-two (72) hours, the commissioner shall require the replacement
thereof and shall engage the services of a plumber to perform the required
work, which cost shall be invoiced to the building owner, plus a cost of ten
(10) percent for processing costs to be paid to the village. In the case of an
emergency repair, the commissioner may require the replacement of the device
and arrange with a plumber for the device to be removed. The cost of this work
will be invoiced to the building owner at actual cost.
      (6)   Installation of devices:
         a.   A reduced pressure principle type backflow preventer may be
installed subject to full static pressure.
         b.   Backflow and backsiphonage preventing devices containing
backflows to separate fixtures shall be accessibly located, preferably in the
same room with the fixture they serve. Installation in utility or service
spaces, provided they are readily accessible, is also permitted.
      (7)   Below-rim supply:
         a.   Where a potable water outlet terminates below the rim of a tank
or vat, and the tank or vat has an overflow of diameter not less than two (2)
inches, the overflow pipe shall be provided with an air gap as close to the
tank as possible.
         b.   The potable water outlet to the tank or vat shall terminate a
distance not less than one and one-half (11/2) times the height to which water
can rise in the tank above the top of the overflow. This level shall be
established at the maximum flow rate of the supply to the tank or vat and with
all outlets, except the air gap overflow outlet, closed. The distance from the
outlet to the high water level shall be measured from the critical point of the
potable water supply outlet.
      (8)   Village-approved devices to protect against backflow and
backsiphonage shall be installed at all fixtures and equipment where backflow
and backsiphonage may occur and where a minimum air gap cannot be provided
between the water outlet to the fixture or equipment and its flood-level rim.
Where a potable water connection is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump or
other equipment with a hazard of backflow or backsiphonage where the water
connection is subject to back pressure and an air gap cannot be installed, the
commissioner will require adequate protection which will include the use of an
approved reduced pressure principal backflow preventer.
      (9)   When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system, and
the possibility exists that a positive pressure of less than twenty (20) psi
may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low-
pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or
negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to
other outlets.
      (10)   Prior to the installation of any backflow preventer, a drawing
showing the location of the device, the method of installation and the size of
the plumbing system shall be approved by the commissioner. In addition, a copy
of the manufacturer's specifications for the device and its installation shall
be given to the commissioner. After installation, any change in the drawing
previously submitted shall be made by the person installing the device;
provided, however, that no change from the original method of installation on
the drawing may be made without prior approval of the commissioner.

(Ord. No. 5-2014 § 1, 3-3-14)
ARTICLE X. POST CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER RUNOFF
Sec. 5-407. General Provisions.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   Land development projects alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
      (2)   This storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants; and
      (3)   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can
be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff from
development sites.
Therefore, the Village of Evergreen Park establishes this set of water quality
and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm
water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public
interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this Article is to establish minimum storm
water management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. This Article seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels.
      (2)   Minimize pollution caused by storm water runoff from development
that would otherwise degrade local water quality.
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
      (4)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
   (c)   Applicability. This Article shall apply to all sites, as defined
herein provided that the following may be exempted by the Village:
      (1)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures.
      (2)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the Village.
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
provided that such development is not part of a larger common development plan.
      (4)   Developments that have been granted a waiver under Section
5-410.
Decisions on permitting shall be made by the Building Commissioner and on-site
storm water requirements shall be made by the Village Engineer. This
determination shall be dependent upon the amount of impervious area created by
the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the Village.
   (d)   Compatibility with Other Permit and Article Requirements. This Article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule
or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this
Article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of
this Article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other
Article, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions
are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or
the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

   Unless judged by the Village to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all
sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible, establish
storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water
discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for
storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent
practical.
   (b)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the Illinois Urban
Manual.
   (c)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a storm
water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under
the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement applies
to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (d)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the Village
to determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements.
   (e)   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the MWRDGC
shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices where applicable.
(Ord. No. 7-2014 § 1, 3-3-14)
Sec. 5-412. Basic Storm Water Management Design Criteria.
   (a)   Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture storm
water runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to wet
bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent to or near existing wetlands
or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the Village and all
flows from the development shall be routed through the basin.
   (b)   Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain
developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the
Village. Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout
the property's drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and
to reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
   (c)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with storm water management include
open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation, wetlands and water quality
mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions of the property
exclusively for storm water management.
(Ord. No. 7-2014 § 1, 3-3-14)
Sec. 5-413. Post Construction Management.
   (a)   The requirements of Section IV (D)(2)(b) of NPDES permit No. ILR10

delivery shall be deemed to occur when the transferee, or the transferee's
representative or agent, receives or becomes entitled to receive possession of
the instrument of transfer.
   (c)   The primary incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are
on the seller, grantor, assignor or other transferor; provided, however, that
if the transferor is exempt from the tax by operation of federal or state law,
then the incidence of the tax and obligation to pay the tax shall be upon the
transferee.
   (d)   The tax imposed by this article shall be due whether the transfer of a
controlling interest in a real estate entity is effected by one transaction or
by a series of related transactions. For purposes of this subsection, it shall
be presumed unless proved otherwise that transactions are related if they occur
within the same 24-month period.
   (e)   Nothing in this article shall be construed to impose a tax upon any
transaction or privilege which, under the constitutions of the United States or

attributable to the transfer of such real property or such beneficial interest.

village during the 60-day period before the change takes effect. After the
effective date of the change, it shall be unlawful for any person to pay the
tax imposed by this article.
      (2)   Any person lawfully in possession of unused tax stamps of a
superseded issue or design may, not later than 90 days after the effective date
of the change, surrender the stamps to the village clerk together with a sworn

interest in the real property (including any lien) acquired by a person in
connection with the person providing financing to the transferee taxpayer (or
the taxpayer's nominee or designee) for the acquisition of the real property.
The absence of tax stamps in the proper amount on the deed, assignment or other
instrument of transfer pursuant to which the transferee taxpayer acquired title
to, or beneficial interest in, the real property shall constitute constructive
notice of the village's lien to the person providing financing.
   (c)   The village may not commence an action to foreclose upon the lien more
than seven years after the transfer giving rise to the tax liability.
Sec. 11-72. Maintaining books and records.

paid in the event of purchase of another single-family residential unit within
the village for use as the transferor's primary residence. The purchase must
occur not earlier than 3 months prior to nor more than 12 months after the sale
of the property for which the transfer tax rebate is applied for.
The amount of the rebate is the lesser of either the amount of the transfer tax
paid to the Village on the replacement property or the amount of the transfer
tax paid to the Village on the original property. In the event of new
construction of the replacement property, an amount equal to .5% of the total
construction cost as approved by the Mayor may be rebated, provided that the
total amount of rebate does not exceed the amount of transfer tax paid to the
Village on the original property.

business regulation certificates or permits shall be paid in advance at the
time application therefor is made to the village clerk in the amounts
prescribed in the schedule set forth in division 2 of this article. When an
applicant has not engaged in the business or activity until after the
expiration of part of the current business regulation certificate year, the
business regulation certificate fee shall be prorated by quarters and the fee
paid for each quarter or fraction thereof during which the business or activity
has been or will be conducted. Except as otherwise provided, all business
regulation certificate and permit fees shall become a part of the corporate
fund. In no event shall any rebate or refund be made of any business regulation
certificate or permit fee, or part thereof, by reason of death or departure of

of the time of expiration of the business regulation certificate held by the
certificate holder (if an annual) three (3) weeks prior to the date of such
expiration. Provided, a failure to make such notification, or the failure of
the certificate holder to receive it, shall not excuse the certificate holder
from the obligation to obtain a new business regulation certificate or a
renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in action based upon operation
without a business regulation certificate.
(Code 1965, § 18-8; Ord. No. 3-1989, § 1, 2-6-89)
Sec. 11-107. Change of location.
The location of any regulated business or occupation, or the location of any

(Code 1965, § 18-10)
Sec. 11-108. Certificate required for each location or separate business.
No business regulation certificate for the operation of a business or
establishment in the village shall be construed to permit the operation of a
regulated business or establishment in more than one (1) location in the
village; a separate business regulation certificate shall be required for each
location of a regulated establishment. For the purpose of this article, the
existence of a single location shall be evidenced by the fact that all
buildings containing the principal or accessory uses shall be connected or
shall be located on the same lot or parcel, shall be operated and managed by
the same person or owner, and shall be an establishment with the same
classification. Where two (2) or more separate businesses, separately owned or
operated, share floor/land space in the same building or on the same parcel of
ground, each shall be deemed a separate business and shall be required to
obtain a separate business certificate based on the square foot area of each
separate use.
Sec. 11-109. Display.
It shall be the duty of every person conducting a regulated business in the
village to keep his business regulation certificate posted in a prominent place
on the premises used for such business at all times.
Sec. 11-110. Business vehicle sticker.
Whenever the number of vehicles used is the basis, in whole or in part, for a
business regulation certificate fee, the village clerk shall furnish the
certificate holder with a tag or sticker for each vehicle covered by the
business regulation certificate, and such tag or sticker shall be posted or
affixed in a conspicuous place on each such vehicle.
Sec. 11-111. Suspension; revocation.
   (a)   Suspension of certificate. When the conduct or operation of any
business or establishment, whether or not regulated, shall constitute a
nuisance in fact and a clear and present danger to the public health, safety or
general welfare, the mayor shall be authorized to summarily order the cessation
of business, the closing of the premises, and the suspension of any business
regulation certificate or permit for a period not to exceed ten (10) days.
   (b)   Hearing. The mayor is authorized to call a hearing for the purpose of
determining whether or not the business regulation certificate or permit should
be suspended or revoked. The mayor is authorized to designate a hearing officer
to preside over any proceeding relating to the suspension, revocation or
refusal to renew a business regulation certificate.
   (c)   Notice of hearing. Notice of the hearing for revocation of a business
regulation certificate or permit shall be given in writing setting forth
specifically the grounds of the complaint and the time and place of hearing.
Such notice shall be sent by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the
certificate holder or permittee at his last known address at least five (5)
days prior to the date set for the hearing.
   (d)   Hearing procedures. At the hearing the village attorney shall present
the complaint and shall represent the village. The certificate holder or
permittee shall be permitted counsel and shall have the right to submit
evidence and cross examine witnesses. The mayor, or his designee, shall preside
and shall render the decision. The decision of the mayor, or his designee, is
subject to judicial review by common law certiorari.
   (e)   Causes for revocation. Business regulation certificates and permits
issued under the ordinances of the village, unless otherwise provided, may be
revoked by the mayor after notice and hearing as provided in subsections (c)
and (d) of this section for any of the following causes:
      (1)   Any fraud, misrepresentation or false statement contained in the
application for the certificate or permit.
      (2)   Any violation by the certificate holder or permittee of ordinance
provisions relating to the certificate or permit, the subject matter of the
certificate or permit, or the premises occupied.
      (3)   Conviction of the certificate holder or permittee of any felony or
of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude in the conduct of the business or
occupation.
      (4)   Failure of the certificate holder or permittee to pay any fine or
penalty owing to the village.
      (5)   Refusal to permit an inspection or sampling, or any interference
with a duly authorized village officer or employee while in the performance of
his duties in making such inspections, as provided in section
11-7.
      (6)   Violation of any ordinance or state law in the licensed premises.
      (7)   Any conduct of the business contrary to the public health, safety
or welfare.
Such revocation, if ordered, shall not preclude prosecution and imposition of
any other penalties provided for the violation of other applicable ordinances
of the village.

debt shall be granted a business regulation certificate and permit, nor shall
the same be renewed, until the fine or debt is satisfied.

DIVISION 2. FEE SCHEDULE
Sec. 11-131. Purpose and jurisdiction.
   (a)   Because each commercial establishment located in the village is a
basic part of and affects the physical and economic well-being of the village
necessitating special services from the village in the form of fire, health,
sanitation, building and police inspections and services, such commercial
establishments shall in all respects be in full compliance with the provisions
of this article. This article is designed to provide for the means whereby the
village may render the necessary inspections and services to commercial
establishments and commercial areas in order to promote, protect and safeguard
the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the village and to
enable the effecting of an accurate record of commercial establishments located
and carrying on commercial activities or commerce within the village.
   (b)   The commercial establishments so regulated may or may not have their
principal place of business located within the village.
   (c)   The business regulation fees provided for herein are not intended to
license any business or profession nor are they to be construed as an
endorsement of the competency or skill of any individual, company, corporation
or other entity. Only governmental activities and other approved eleemosynary
activities will be issued a certificate without charge, except as may be
required herein.
   (d)   Business regulation fees based upon square foot area are predicated
upon the premises that there is a finite amount of square footage in all of the
commercial zoning districts within the village. These commercial districts
require substantial services over and above the services provided for single-
family homes and other residential districts. The business activities conducted
within the finite square foot area of the commercial districts of the village
require these extra services regardless of the activity being conducted within
each commercial space. All measurements are expressed in square feet and shall
be to the nearest integral square foot; if a fraction is one-half square foot
or more, the integral square foot next above shall be taken. Therefore, the fee
is based equitably upon the square foot area of each place of business as a
minimum fee as identified in section
11-133.
   (e)   The basis for the fee schedule may be based on additional factors
other than the square foot area of the business establishment. Other fees
charged are set out specifically for those activities as identified in section
11-134.
(Code 1965, §§ 18-31, 18-32(a)(6))
Sec. 11-132. Responsibility of owner, lessor, occupant.
   (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the owner, lessor and occupant of
any premises to ensure that the required business regulation certificate and
business regulation fees have been paid for any and all persons occupying or
operating out of those premises. It shall be the responsibility of the owner,
lessor, or occupant of any premises to require that any automatic vending
machine on the premises display the proper village sticker showing that all
fees have been paid.
   (b)   If a person is found not to have been issued the required business
regulation certificate or not to have paid the business regulation fees, the
premises where that person or its machines are situated may be closed by the
mayor in accordance with the provisions of section
11-111. Those premises may be closed whether or not the person violating the
provisions is the major owner or tenant of the premises, the intent of this
section being that the owner, lessor, and occupant of the premises shall be
responsible for all parties occupying the same to see that the proper business
regulation certificate and business regulation fees are obtained and paid.
(Code 1965, § 18-35)
Sec. 11-133. Regulatory fees.
   (a)   Schedule. A minimum regulatory fee schedule shall be based on square
feet of floor/ land area as herein defined. Commercial establishments using
surface area of land for storage, display and/or sales and service shall be
based on square feet of area. Special enumerated fees shall be in addition to
this minimum. See section
11-134.

filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing.
Sec. 11-382. Installment Contracts.

local tax administrator that the payment is 30 days delinquent, the taxpayer

delinquency within the 14-day period or fails to demonstrate good faith in
restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator, the

owing.

after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the applicable
period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for the
applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (b)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any 4-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the Village,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be 6 years after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
   (c)   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
Sec. 11-384. Voluntary Disclosure.
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month or part thereof, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than 4 years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this Section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
Sec. 11-385. Publication of Tax Ordinances.
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
Clerk's office.
Sec. 11-386. Local Tax Administrator.
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      (i)   timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
      (ii)   correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
      (iii)   correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
Sec. 11-387. Application.
This Article shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the Village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this Article, this Article shall be
controlling.

Sec. 12-306. Truancy.
   (a)   Purpose.
      (1)   School attendance, as mandated by Illinois School Code, is
essential for both a complete education and for the social development of the
child. Often, truancy is a manifestation of an underlying situation or problem
a student may be experiencing such as addiction, depression or social issues,
which may be addressed through proper diagnosis and counseling. Truancy has an
effect on society as a whole, which may be realized through parents missed work
time, truant children engaging in more severe or criminal activity or the
downgraded education of our population.
      (2)   The intent of this section is to address the issue of chronic
truancy regarding those students enrolled in schools located within the
corporate limits of the village and, if appropriate, mandate available services
as may be necessary to resolve the underlying issues of chronic truancy. The
goal of the village, in conjunction with the schools, is to provide assistance
to these students and have them resume their education.
   (b)   Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this
section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except when
the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
      Chronic Truancy means any chronic truant minor who has been absent on
more than one (1) occasion during a school year without cause or acceptable
excuse.
      Chronic Truant Minormeans a truant minor, to whom supportive services,
including prevention, diagnostic, intervention and remedial services,
alternative programs and other school and community resources, has been
provided and has failed to result in the cessation of habitual or ongoing
truant behavior, or has been offered and refused.
      Minor means a child who is seventeen (17) years of age or younger.
      Schoolmeans either a public or private educational institution fully
accredited or certified by the Illinois Department of Education.
      Truant Minormeans a minor in any school accredited or certified by the
Illinois Department of Education, located within the village, who is absent
without cause or an acceptable excuse from such attendance for a school day or
portion thereof.
   (c)   Prohibition of Chronic Truancy.  
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for a minor enrolled in any school located
within the village and subject to the compulsory attendance requirements of the

      (2)   A chronic truant minor shall be identified to the Evergreen Park
Police Department by the minor's school, along with any and all information
detailing absences from school.
      (3)   Prior to a minor being cited under this section for chronic
truancy, the school must have provided supportive services, including
prevention, diagnostic, intervention and remedial services, alternative
programs and other school and community resources that have failed to result in

the student and refused.
   (d)   Parental responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any parent,
guardian, or person having custody or control of a minor enrolled in any school
located in the village to cause, permit or encourage a minor to become a
chronic truant minor or engage in chronic truancy.
   (e)   Excused absences. If a parent, guardian or person having legal custody
and control over a minor presents in writing to school officials within twenty-
four (24) hours after an occurrence or such other deadline as established by
the school, any of the following reasons for an absence, there is a rebuttable
presumption that it is a legitimate and acceptable excuse:
      (1)   Illness (if illness persists more than five (5) days, a doctor's
report will be required detailing the nature of the illness and the projected
return date of the student);
      (2)   Observance of a religious holiday;
      (3)   Death in the family;
      (4)   Family emergency;
      (5)   Any situation beyond the control of the minor as determined by the
student’s school officials; or
      (6)   Such other circumstances which cause reasonable concern to the
parent for the safety or health of the minor.
   (f)   Violation notice. Citations issued for violation of this section may
be processed through the administrative adjudication process as provided in
Chapter 12, Article X of the Evergreen Park Municipal Code.

ARTICLE X. ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION OF NON-VEHICULAR REGULATIONS VIOLATIONS
Sec. 12-370. Purpose.
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method of
enforcing the Village of Evergreen Park's ("Village") regulations through
administrative adjudication of charges of non-vehicular violations of the
Village Code. All provisions of the Village Code may be enforced through the
administrative adjudication system, provided the system shall have no authority
to impose a penalty of incarceration or adjudicate an offense under the
Illinois Motor Vehicle code which is a traffic regulation governing moving
vehicles, or to impose a fine in excess of $50,000.00. The Village reserves its
right to employ all other means and methods available under the law to enforce
its Village Code, including direct application to the Courts.
Section 1-2.1-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-2) allows home
rule municipalities to provide by ordinance for a system of administrative
adjudication of municipal code violations to the extent permitted by the
Illinois Constitution. The Village is a home rule municipality. The Illinois
Constitution provides that a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform
any function pertaining to its government and affairs (Illinois Constitution,
Art. VII, Sec. 6(a) (1970)). The Illinois Constitution also provides that a
home rule unit may exercise and perform concurrently with the State any power
or function of a home rule unit to the extent that the General Assembly by law
does not specifically limit the concurrent exercise or specifically declare the
State's exercise to be exclusive (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(i)
(1970)). The Illinois Constitution further provides that the powers and
functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally.
(Ord. No. 6-2007 § 1, 2-5-07)
Sec. 12-371. Administrative Composition.
The system of administrative adjudication of non-vehicular regulations
violations shall be composed of a Code Hearing Unit which shall be comprised of
a Hearing Officer, and may include any one or more of the following: an
Administrator, Computer Operator/System Coordinator and Hearing Room Personnel
(Deputy), with the power, authority and limitations as are hereinafter set
forth:
   (a)   Powers of the Hearing Officer. A Hearing Officer shall have all of the
powers granted to hearing officers under State law, set forth at 65 ILCS 5/1-
2.1-4, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by this reference,
including the power to:
      (1)   Preside over all administrative hearings as the adjudicator.
      (2)   Administer oaths. It shall be the duty of each respondent and

must comply. The Hearing Officer’s findings may be made orally.
      (8)   Impose penalties consistent with applicable Village Code provisions
and assess costs upon finding a party liable for the charged violation.

the fine or penalty to $750.00 the Hearing Officer shall have the authority to
impose fines and penalties up to $50,000.00.
      (9)   Order the removal of persons whose conduct is disruptive to the
hearing process.
      (10)   In no event shall a hearing officer have the authority to:
         A.   Impose a penalty of incarceration.
         B.   Impose a fine in excess of $50,000.00.
         C.   The maximum mandatory fine under subsection (b), shall be
exclusive of costs of enforcement or costs imposed to secure compliance with
the municipality's ordinances and shall not be applicable to cases to enforce
the collection of any tax imposed and collected by the municipality.
      (11)   Request that the village prosecutor, village attorney, or other
attorney representing the village attend to formally prosecute particular
citations. In such a case, the Hearing Officer shall establish the order of
proof. However, the citation shall remain prima facie evidence of the offense
as provided in this Article.
   (b)   Powers of the Administrator. The Administrator shall be empowered and

the Violation Notice within the administrative adjudication system as otherwise
provided for by this Article.
   (e)   Service of Violation Notices. Service of Violation Notices shall be
made in a manner reasonably calculated to give the defendant actual notice, by:
      (1)   Handing a copy of the Violation Notice to the person charged; or

with a judgment ordering the correction of a Village Code violation or imposing
any fine or other sanction as a result of the Village Code violation, a
statement that any expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the judgment,
including but not limited to, attorneys' fees, court costs and costs related to
property demolition or foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing the
municipality and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
      (5)   A notice of judgment entered by default shall be forwarded to any
person who fails to appear and shall contain the same information as a
determination of liability stating that the judgment may be set aside by the
Hearing Officer if, within 21 days of issuance of the judgment, a petition is
received stating what the Hearing Officer determines is good cause for failure
to appear. The Hearing Officer, upon making a determination of good cause shall
provide the petitioner with notice of a new hearing date or denial of the
petition. The default judgment shall state that it shall constitutes a final
determination of liability if such petition is not received, if the petition is
denied, or if after setting of a new hearing date the person fails to appear.
   (g)   Final Determination - The determination of liability shall constitute
a final determination for purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law as set forth in 735 ILCS 5/

shall retain independent counsel to prepare and file the administrative record
and appear on behalf of the Code Hearing Unit.

under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final
determination of a Village Code violation unless stayed by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of the Housing Officer may be
enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

which a person has failed to comply with a Hearing Officer's judgment ordering
the correction of a Village Code violation or imposing any fine or other
sanction as a result of a Village Code violation, any expenses incurred by the
Village to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to, attorneys'
fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or foreclosure,
after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the Hearing
Officer, shall be a debt due ad owing the Village and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law.

or safe under the conditions found to exist upon such streets. It is hereby
declared that the prima facie speed limit shall be twenty (20) miles per hour

property shall be afforded process as specified in Section 13-282. Nothing in
this section shall be interpreted to create a duty on behalf of the village to

threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public due to its location or
condition.

Sec. 13-408. Posting a Bond.
   If a bond in the amount of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) is posted with the
Village, the impounded vehicle will be released to the owner of record, upon
the payment by the owner of record of the towing and storage costs. If a
penalty is imposed for a violation of this Article, the bond will be forfeited
to the Village; provided, in the event that a violation of this Article is not
proven, the bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond
money posted pursuant to this Article will be held by the Village until the
hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until a
reviewing court issues a final decision.

Sec. 13-409. Preliminary Hearing on Impoundment.
   Where the owner of a vehicle seized under the provisions of this Article
requests a preliminary hearing within twelve (12) hours after the seizure of
the motor vehicle, the Watch Commander or any supervising officer must conduct
a preliminary hearing within twenty-four (24) hours after the request for the
preliminary hearing is received by the Village; provided that if the date for
the hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the preliminary
hearing will be held on the next business day following the Saturday, Sunday or
legal holiday. No preliminary hearing shall be required or granted to an owner
whose vehicle was not seized or impounded pursuant to this Article. For
purposes of this Section, the following shall apply:
   (a)   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the preliminary hearing.
   (b)   The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay testimony will be allowed, and will be admissible.
   (c)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Watch Commander or
supervising officer determines that there was probable cause to believe that
the vehicle was being used in violation of Section
13-406, and further determines that the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle
was proper under Section
13-407, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle unless the
owner of the vehicle posts a cash bond with the Village in the amount of Six
Hundred Dollars ($600.00). Posting of the bond shall not relieve the owner from
paying any applicable towing and storage costs associated with the seizure and
impoundment of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the Watch Commander or supervising officer determines that there
was no probable cause to believe a violation of Section
13-406 occurred or otherwise determines that the vehicle should not have been
seized or impounded pursuant to Section
13-407, the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record of the
vehicle without the posting of the bond and without the costs associated with
the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle. A determination that the vehicle
should not have been seized or impounded pursuant to Section
13-407 has no bearing nor will relieve an owner of responsibility for violating
Section
13-406 of this Article.

Sec. 13-410. Final Hearing.
   (a)   Notice of Hearing.  Any owner issued a citation for a violation of
Section
13-406 of this Article shall have the right to request a hearing to challenge
the citation and/or subsequent impoundment. Notice shall be given, to the owner
of record, of the ability to request a hearing. Such notice shall be mailed by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record, as shown on
the records of the Illinois Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail need
not be given when the owner of the vehicle has been personally served with
notice, in written form, of his ability to apply for a hearing under subsection
(b). If the owner of the vehicle requests a hearing pursuant to subsection (b),
the Village, within forty-five (45) days, shall notify the owner of record of
the date, time and location of a hearing. Notice of the date, time and location
of the hearing shall be sent via regular mail.
   (b)   Requesting a Hearing.  Any person cited under this Article may apply
for a hearing when they believe that they or the person driving the vehicle was
not in violation of this Article at the time the citation was issued and/or
they otherwise believe that the impoundment of the vehicle was improper under
the circumstances. The application for a hearing shall be made no later than
seven (7) days after notice has been given either personally or by certified
mail, whichever is applicable in the given circumstance. The application to
request a hearing shall be provided by the Village at the time notice is given.
The bond will be forfeited in the event a hearing is not requested as provided
for in this ordinance.
   (c)   Hearing.  For purposes of this Section, the following shall apply to
the owners hearing:
      (1)   Unless continued by order of the hearing officer, the hearing shall
be held within sixty (60) days after the motor vehicle was seized.
      (2)   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the final hearing.
      (3)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in
violation of Section
13-406, and otherwise determines that the seizure and impoundment of the
vehicle was proper pursuant to Section
13-407, the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the
vehicle until the owner of the vehicle pays to the Village a penalty in the
amount of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), plus the towing and storage costs. In
the event the vehicle was not impounded, an order shall be entered wherein the
owner of record shall be liable to the Village in the amount of Six Hundred
Dollars ($600.00). The penalty and costs shall be a debt due and owing to the
Village.
       (4)   If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing
officer shall enter an order of default in favor of the Village, which order
shall require the payment to the Village of an administrative penalty of Six
Hundred Dollars ($600.00).
      (5)   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not used as
hereinabove provided in violation of Section
13-406, the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record of the
vehicle without any penalty or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously
been posted, the cash bond shall be returned.
      (6)   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was used in
violation of Section
13-406, but determines that the vehicle was not properly subject to seizure or
impoundment under Section
13-407, the hearing officer shall enter a judgment against the owner in the
amount of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) and release the seized vehicle without
towing and storage costs and/or order the reimbursement of towing and storage
costs if the vehicle was previously released. The penalty shall be a debt due
and owing to the Village.
      (7)   The ticket issued shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
offense stated was committed.

Sec. 13-411. Unclaimed Vehicles.
   (a)   Any motor vehicle that is not claimed within thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the time in which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the action of the Village under this Article, or the time at which a
final judgment is rendered in favor of the Village by a Court, or the time at
which a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record
who is in default, may be disposed of as an abandoned or unclaimed vehicle, as
otherwise provided by law.
   (b)   If the penalty and towing and storage costs are not paid within eighty
(80) days after a penalty is imposed pursuant to this Article, the vehicle
shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be disposed of in the manner provided
by law for the disposition of abandoned or unclaimed vehicles, unless a
petition for judicial review is filed with a court of proper jurisdiction.
Where a petition for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination is
filed and pending in a court of proper jurisdiction, the vehicle shall not be
deemed to be abandoned and shall not be sold. If the petition for judicial
review is resolved in favor of the Village, the vehicle shall be deemed
abandoned and may be disposed of by the Village if the penalty and towing and
storage costs are not paid within thirty (30) days after the date of the
Court's order.

shall be liable to the Village for a penalty of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00)
in addition to any fees for the towing and storage of the motor vehicle.
   (b)   Fees for towing and storage are established by the towing company, and

ARTICLE XIII. AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM
Sec. 13-500. Definitions.
    As used in this article, words or terms shall have the following meaning
unless the context or usage clearly indicates another meaning was intended:
   Administrator means the Village's Traffic Compliance Administrator and/or
his/her designee.
   Automated traffic law enforcement system means a device within the Village
of Evergreen Park with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction
with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering
an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation
of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code ("Code"), 625 ILCS 5/11-306, or
similar violation of the Evergreen Park Municipal Code. The automated traffic
law enforcement system shall not be used to enforce speed regulations.
   Automatic traffic law violation means a "disregarding a traffic control
device" violation or a "no turn on red" violation, as those terms are defined
in this section.
   Certified report means a report to the Illinois Secretary of State
concerning five or more unsatisfied automated traffic law violations.
   Code means Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/1-100, et seq.
   Disregarding a traffic control device means a failure to stop and remain
stopped before an intersection that is controlled by a red signal as provided
for in Section 11-306 of the Code. Disregarding a traffic control device, for
purposes of the automated traffic law enforcement system, shall not include:
(1) those instances when a motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not
enter the intersection, as defined by Section 1-132 of the Code, during the
cycle of the red signal unless one or more pedestrians or bicyclists are
present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or
crosswalk where the driver is required to stop, as specified in Section 11-306
(c) of the Code, or similar violation of the Evergreen Park Municipal Code; or
(2) those instances where a motorcyclist enters an intersection against a red
signal indication when the red signal fails to change to green within a
reasonable period of time because of a signal malfunction or because the signal
has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle due to the motorcycle's size
or weight.
   No turn on red means failure to stop and remain stopped, and not proceeding
to turn right at, an intersection controlled by both a sign indicating "No turn
on red," or other similar language, and a red signal as provided for in Section
11-306 of the Code.
   Recorded images means images produced by the automated traffic law
enforcement system, which consist of either: two or more photographs; two or
more microphotographs; two or more electronic images; or a video recording
showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the
recording, clearly identifying the registration plate number of the motor
vehicle.
   Village means the Village of Evergreen Park, Cook County, Illinois.
(Ord. No. 23-2007 § 1, 4-2-07; Am. Ord. No. 6-2016 § 1, 3-7-16)
Sec. 13-501. System Established.
   There is established within the village an automated traffic law enforcement
system program.
   (a)   The village shall have the discretion to locate individual automated
traffic law enforcement systems at such intersections as may be deemed
appropriate.
   (b)   An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement
system shall be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating
that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law
enforcement system.
   (c)    The village shall provide notice to drivers on its website of the
location of all intersections equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system. Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system shall have a yellow change interval that conforms to the
Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (IMUTCD) published by the
Illinois Department of Transportation.
   (d)   The village shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety
impact of each automated traffic law enforcement system at an in intersection
following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based
upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a
period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to
provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical
analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry
practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data
required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be
conducted within a reasonable time period following the installation of the
automated traffic law enforcement system. If the statistical analysis for the
36 month period following installation of the system indicates that there has
been an increase in the rate of accidents at the approach to the intersection
monitored, additional studies shall be undertaken to determine the cause and
severity of the accidents, and the village may take any action that it
determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the
accidents at the intersection.
(Ord. No. 6-2016 § 1, 3-7-16)
Sec. 13-502. Office of Traffic Compliance Administrator.
   There is hereby established the office of Traffic Compliance Administrator,
which shall be filled by appointment of the Mayor with the advice and consent
of the Trustees. The Administrator, or his or her designee, shall be authorized
to adopt, distribute and process violation notices and other notices required
by this article and the Code, collect money paid as fines and penalties for
automated traffic law violations, and administer the administrative
adjudication system for automated traffic law violations. The Administrator is
also authorized to draft and issue any certified reports to the Illinois
Secretary of State as required by this article and the Code. The Administrator
shall make the recorded images of a violation accessible to an alleged violator
by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through
the Internet.
(Ord. No. 6-2016 § 1, 3-7-16)
Sec. 13-503. Violations.
   It shall be unlawful to "disregard a traffic control device" or violate a
"no turn on red" as those terms are defined in this article.
(Ord. No. 23-2007 § 1, 4-2-07; Am. Ord. No. 6-2016 § 1, 3-7-16)   
Sec. 13-504. Violation notice.
   (a)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor
vehicle violating Section
13-503 of this article, the Administrator shall issue a written violation
notice to the registered owner of the vehicle, which shall be mailed within 30
days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the village of the identity
of the registered owner of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90 days
following the violation. If any notice to an addressee is returned as
undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database of the owner of the cited
vehicle. The second notice shall be made via first class mail postage prepaid.
Service shall be complete on the date the notice is placed in the United States
mail.
   (b)   No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written
lease agreement shall be liable for an automated traffic law enforcement system
violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided
that upon the request of the Administrator received within 120 days after the
violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the
name and address of the lessee. The driver's license number of a lessee may be
subsequently individually requested by the Administrator if needed for
enforcement purposes. Upon the provision of information by the lessor, the
Administrator shall issue the violation notice to the lessee of the vehicle in
the same manner as it would issue a violation notice to a registered owner, and
the lessee may be held liable for the violation, and all other provisions
applicable to owners in this article shall apply to the lessee.
   (c)   Before a violation notice is issued, a determination must be made by a
technician employed or contracted by the village that, based on the inspection
of recorded images generated by the system, the motor vehicle was being
operated in violation of Section
13-503 of this article. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a
violation, a violation notice shall be issued and served upon the registered
vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. If the technician determines
that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in
order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not
be issued. The Administrator, or his/her designee shall retain a copy of all
violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
registered owner of the motor vehicle. Such documents shall be kept in the
ordinary course of business. Each violation notice and the recorded images
shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is
admissible in any proceeding relative to the violation, and shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation.
   (d)   The violation notice shall include the following information:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database;
      (2)   The make (only if discernable) and registration number of the motor
vehicle involved in the violation;
      (3)   The violation charged;
      (4)   The location where the violation occurred;
      (5)   The date and time of the violation;
      (6)   A copy of the recorded images;
      (7)   The amount of the civil fine imposed, and the date on which the
civil fine should be paid;
      (8)   A statement that recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of
a violation;
      (9)   A statement that a failure to pay the civil fine, or to contest
liability in a timely fashion, is an admission of liability and may result in
the suspension of driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle, as
well as the imposition of additional penalty of $100 for failure to pay the
original fine in a timely manner;
      (10)   A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the
fine or challenging the charge at the administrative hearing;
      (11)   A statement that the payment of any fine, and the payment of any
applicable penalty for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of
the violation;
      (12)   A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested; and
      (13)   A website address, accessible through the Internet, where the
person may view the recorded images of the violation.

18-2017, § 1, 11-6-17)
Sec. 13-505. Hearing.
   (a)   The registered owner or lessee of a motor vehicle being operated in
violation of Section
13-503 of this article may request a hearing in persona to challenge the
evidence or contest the citation by mail. The violation notice shall be prima
facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of applicable
defenses. Formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing. Hearings
shall be recorded, and the hearing officer shall be empowered to administer
oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of relevant book and papers. Persons appearing at the
hearing may be represented by counsel at their own expense. A registered owner
or lessee that fails to appear at a hearing which he/she has requested will be
found in default and a final determination will be entered.
   (b)   The following defenses are the only defenses that may be considered by
the Hearing Officer for a violation of Section
13-503 of this article:
      (1)   The operator of the vehicle was issued a Uniform Traffic Control
Citation by a police officer for the same incident;
      (2)   The motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the
possession of the owner at the time of the violation. Provided, however, to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen
before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a
report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed
with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner;
      (3)   The vehicle was leased to another, and within 60 days after the
citation was mailed to the lessor, lessor submitted to the village, together
with a copy of the lease agreement, the lessee's driver's license number, and
any additional information as may be required;
      (4)   The vehicle was an authorized emergency vehicle;
      (5)   The operator of the vehicle passed through the intersection when
the light was red in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or
as part of a funeral procession; or,
      (6)   The respondent was not the registered vehicle owner or lessee of
the cited vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)   Individuals who have been served with a Notice of Violation may
contest the validity of the violation, using the same available defenses as
stated above, without personally appearing at the administrative hearing. To do
so, the individual must complete, in full, the "Request for Hearing - Non-
Appearance" portion of the Notice of Violation. Additionally, the individual
shall submit a notarized statement of the facts that he is relying upon to
establish any one of the defenses referenced in Section 13-503 of this article.
The individual may also submit documentary evidence to be considered by the
Hearing Officer. By signing the "Request for Hearing - Non-Appearance" portion
of the Notice of Violation, the individual acknowledges that he is waiving the
right to appear personally before the Hearing Officer.
Any individual wishing to avail himself of this section must submit the
"Request for Hearing - Non-Appearance," and any other documentation to be
considered by the Hearing Officer, to the village, by the respond-by date
listed on the Notice of Violation. The Administrator shall forward all timely-
submitted materials to the Hearing Officer for review and determination. The
Hearing Officer shall make an adjudication based upon the facts set forth in
the notarized statement of facts filed, any additional documentary evidence,
and the facts contained in the Notice of Violation. Notice of the determination
of the Hearing Officer shall be served via first class mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the registered owner at the address listed on the Illinois
Secretary of State database. Service of the notice shall be complete on the
date the notice is placed in the United States mail. Any individual may seek
review of the Hearing Officer's determination through the mechanisms provided
in this article.
   (d)   No additional fee shall be charged to an alleged violator for
exercising the right to an administrative hearing.

Sec. 13-506. Final determination of liability.
   A final determination of an automated traffic law violation liability shall
occur under the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon the failure to pay the fine or penalty after the Hearing
Officer's determination of liability and the exhaustion of or failure to
exhaust administrative review; or
      (2)   Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged
violation in the time and manner specified, the Hearing Officer's determination
shall become final upon the denial of a timely petition to set aside a
determination, or upon the expiration of the period for filing the petition
without a filing having been made.

liability and the conclusion of judicial review. The notice shall include the
following information:
      (1)   A statement that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing
the Village of Evergreen Park; and
      (2)   A warning that a failure to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
the Village of Evergreen Park may result in the filing of a petition in the
Circuit Court of Cook County to have unpaid fine or penalty rendered as a
judgment or may result in the suspension of the person's driver's license for
failure to pay fines or penalties for five or more automated traffic law
violations.

   (a)   A petition to set aside determination of an automated traffic law
violation must be filed with or mailed to the Administrator within ten days of
the date of mailing of the final determination of liability notice. The grounds
for the petition are limited to:
      (1)   The person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the
date of the violation occurred;
      (2)   The person has paid the fine or penalty for the violation in
question; or
      (3)   Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of
liability, the Administrator, or his designee, shall review the petition to
determine if sufficient cause has been shown to set aside the determination. If
cause has been shown, the Administrator shall forward to the petitioner a new
hearing date on which the petitioner must appear to present his case on the
underlying violation. The Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his
decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within 14 days of his
decision.

notice's date will result in the Administrator notifying the Illinois Secretary
of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings
under Section 6-306.5 of the Code; and
      (2)   A statement that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of the
original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped
envelope to the Administrator along with a request for the copy.
   (b)   The notice shall be sent via first class mail, postage prepaid, to the
address recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State or, if any notice to that
address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a
United States Post Office approved database.

connection with the parade.
      (2)   As a condition of the permit, the permit holder shall keep all
information current. Any change in required information shall be reported to
the chief of police immediately.
      (3)   The application for a parade permit shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable processing fee of $50.
      (4)   The application shall be in a form and format as prescribed by the
chief of police in rules and regulations. The chief of police is authorized to
disregard any application filed not in compliance with such rules and
regulations and the application shall be returned to the applicant.
   (f)   The chief of police shall investigate the facts set out in the
application, in consultation with the police department, which shall be sent
copies of the application immediately upon receipt. Where the chief of police
determines that additional information on the factors set forth in subsection
(g)(1) - (4) is required, copies of the application and a request for such
information also shall be sent to any appropriate village department or other
governmental agency, including any sister agency. Where the chief of police
determines that any such entities may need to make advance preparations for the
parade, or may have information useful to planning for village services
supporting the event, a copy of the permit or an alternative form of notice
shall be sent to the appropriate village department, and any governmental
agency, including any sister agency, which may be affected by the parade.
Every February 1st the chief of police shall send to the mayor and board of
trustees a list of all parade permits granted which have not previously been
reported.
   (g)   After such investigation, the chief of police shall issue a permit
when the chief of police finds that:
      (1)   The parade will not substantially or unnecessarily interfere with
traffic in the area contiguous to the activity, or that, if the parade will
substantially interfere with such traffic, that there are available at the time
of the proposed parade sufficient village resources to mitigate the disruption;
      (2)   There are available at the time of the parade a sufficient number
of on-duty police officers, or other village employees authorized to regulate
traffic, to police and protect lawful participants in the parade and non-
participants from traffic-related hazards in light of the other demands for
police protection at the time of the proposed parade;
      (3)   The concentration of persons, animals, vehicles or things at the
assembly and disbanding areas and along the parade route will not prevent
proper fire and police protection or ambulance service;
      (4)   The parade will not interfere with the use of the requested area by
another party to whom a valid permit has been issued for the same area or
route, or does not conflict with another application, or with a traditional
parade;
      (5)   The parade will not be conducted for any purpose or in any manner
made unlawful elsewhere in this code or by any other local, state or federal
law; and
      (6)   The application contains sufficient information about the person or
organization applying for the permit, the parade organizer, and the proposed
date, time, location, route and number of participants.
   (h)   Subject to subsection (i), all applications for any parade permit
shall be processed on a first-in-time basis; provided that if there is a
conflict between two or more applications filed, the conflict shall be resolved
as follows:
      (1)   During the first five (5) business days of each calendar year, the
chief of police shall accept all applications for a parade permit filed without
giving priority to applications filed first in time; provided however that for
purposes of calculating the number of days required to take action or provide
notice pursuant to subsection (j), all applications filed within the first five
(5) business days of the calendar year shall be deemed as filed on the fifth
business day of the year.
      (2)   Where there is a conflict between two or more applications filed
during the first five (5) business days, or with an application for a
traditional parade, the chief of police shall first evaluate whether the
conflict could be resolved by assigning the applicants consecutive times on the
same day and route, giving consideration to the criteria set forth in
subsection (g)(1) - (4). If the chief of police finds that consecutive times
are appropriate, the chief of police shall notify each applicant that the
permit shall be granted for the specified alternative time. For those
applicants who are not assigned their requested time period, such notice shall
be treated as a denial and offer of alternative under subsection (k) for
purposes of the five (5)-business day time period in which to file an
acceptance or appeal.
Where consecutive times are not deemed appropriate and the conflict is with an
application for a traditional parade, the traditional parade shall receive the
permit in compliance with subsection (i).
      (3)   With respect to any remaining conflicts among permit applications,
the chief of police shall notify the applicants that the conflict shall be
resolved by lottery, and of the date, time and place of the lottery. Within
seven (7) days after the lottery, the applicants not chosen may submit
alternative preferences to the chief of police. Any requests for alternative
preferences submitted by applicants under this subsection shall be treated as a
new application, for purposes of all time limitations under this section, and
any conflicts arising among the alternative preferences shall be resolved in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.
      (4)   Applications for a parade permit received during the first five (5)
business days of the calendar year shall be given priority over applications
received thereafter.
   (i)   For purposes of protecting the expectations and enjoyment of the
public, a traditional parade shall be given a preference to continue on the
traditional date and route of the parade. An application for a permit for a
traditional parade shall be filed between the 1st and 15th day of December in
the year prior to which the parade is to be held. Any application for a permit
for a traditional parade filed after such time shall lose the traditional
parade preference and shall be considered as an application for a non-
traditional parade permit and subject to subsection (h).
In addition to any other information required, the chief of police may request
an applicant for a traditional parade permit to provide information or
documentation that the parade for which the permit is requested meets the
criteria for a traditional parade.
Where the prior organizer of a traditional parade has been consistent and is
ascertainable, that person or organization shall be given the preference.
Where there is a dispute regarding which person or organization shall receive
the traditional parade preference for a certain date or route, the traditional
parade which has been in existence longer shall receive the permit.
Where two (2) or more applications are filed purporting to represent the prior
organizer of a traditional parade, or where there have been different
organizers over the past five (5) years, the chief of police may request those
involved to submit documentation to resolve such conflict. Where the chief of
police finds no clear resolution of the conflict, the chief of police shall
conduct a lottery to select the permittee, and shall notify each applicant in
writing by mail, fax or e-mail of the existence of the conflict and of the
date, time and place of the lottery.
Any applicant who disagrees with the chief of police's actions hereunder may
appeal, in the manner as set forth in subsection (l).
   (j)   (1)   The chief of police shall take action upon the application for a
parade permit, and provide notice thereof, for applications filed in January
within ten (10) business days after filing of an application, for all other
applications within seven (7) business days after the filing thereof or, if any
lottery is held, within seven (7) business days of the lottery, except that
where the purpose of such event is a spontaneous response to a current event,
or where other good and compelling cause is shown, the chief of police shall
act within two (2) business days.
      (2)   Notice shall be made in writing by mail, fax, or e-mail directed to
the applicant, stating the facts and conclusions which are the basis for any
denial of the permit and, if the action taken is setting a lottery date or
offering a consecutive time, then describing the conflict among application
requests. If the chief of police denies an application for failure to provide
sufficient information about the proposed route or the estimated number of
participants, he shall specify what additional information must be provided in
a new or amended application.
      (3)   In the event that the chief of police fails to take action within
the time prescribed in subsection (j)(1) after the date upon which the
application was filed, the application shall be deemed approved and the permit
deemed granted as to the time, date, location and route as set forth in the
application.
   (k)   When the chief of police denies an application for a parade permit,
the chief of police shall authorize the conduct of a parade on a date, at a
time, at a location, or over a route different from that named by the
applicant. This alternate permit shall, to the extent practicable, authorize an
event that will have comparable public visibility and a similar route, location
and date to that of the proposed parade. An applicant desiring to accept an
alternate parade permit shall, within five (5) business days after notice of
the action by the chief of police, file a written notice of acceptance with the
chief of police. Where the denial and alternate are based on a conflict between
applications for a parade permit, however, the procedures set forth in
subsection (h) shall apply.
The chief of police is empowered to limit the parade to the sidewalk or to one
or more traffic lanes of the street if it is determined that such limited area
is capable of accommodating the number of parade participants or parade units
anticipated, based upon the information submitted by the applicant and the
experience of previous comparable events, and such limitation shall not be
considered a denial.
   (l)   (1)   Any applicant who believes that his application for a permit is
wrongfully denied may file an appeal with the mayor within five (5) business
days of the date of notice of the chief of police's decision. If no appeal is
filed within five (5) business days of the date of notice of the chief of
police's decision, that decision shall be deemed final.
Upon the filing of such appeal, the mayor shall cause a hearing to be held
within five (5) business days and based upon the evidence contained in the
record of such hearing, either affirm or reverse the decision of the chief of
police.
Any final decision of the mayor shall be subject to judicial review in
accordance with applicable law.
In the event that the mayor fails to act within two (2) business days of the
conclusion of a hearing held under this section, the application for a permit
shall be deemed approved and the permit deemed granted as to the date, time,
location and route as set forth in the application.
      (2)   If there is not sufficient time to file the appeal in accordance
with the procedure set forth in this subsection, the decision by the chief of
police shall be deemed a final decision subject to judicial review in
accordance with applicable law.
   (m)   (1)   At least one (1) week prior to the scheduled parade, the parade
organizer shall submit to the chief of police a line of march, which shall list
all parade units in numerical order, with a description and an estimate of the
size or length of each unit. For any new parade, and for any parade for which
in the prior year the estimate of the number or size of units was substantially
inaccurate, the parade coordinator also shall be required to submit
documentation demonstrating the planned participation of the parade units. At
least one (1) week prior to the scheduled parade, the parade organizer shall
furnish to the chief of police documents demonstrating compliance with the
insurance requirement set forth in this section, if required.
      (2)   Where animals will participate or be involved in the parade, the
parade coordinator must provide: a veterinarian's certificate of good health
for each animal to be used; the name of the attending local veterinarian who
shall provide care for any sick or injured animals; a copy of the handler's
federal exhibitor's license for any animal identified in the Illinois Dangerous
Animal Act; and access to an animal ambulance.
In order to protect the health and safety of the public, village employees are
authorized to inspect animals prior to their use in the parade and to prohibit
the use of any animal found to be diseased or unhealthy, or which poses a
danger to public health and safety.
      (3)   The chief of police may establish in rules and regulations
provisions for the orderly conduct of the parade, including requiring the
parade units to proceed at a reasonable pace.
   (n)   (1)   The parade shall last no longer than two (2) hours and fifteen
(15) minutes, except that where a traditional parade consistently has lasted
longer and the chief of police determines that there is no traffic safety or
undue congestion problem in continuing to allow the longer time period, the
permit may provide for additional hours. The parade permit time may be reduced
by the chief of police after receipt of the parade lineup, where the number and
size of the planned parade units are not sufficient to fill the permit time
while proceeding at a reasonable pace, or may be reduced by the police
department on location, for the same reason, where the actual size and number
of parade units at the lineup are insufficient to require a two (2) hour and
fifteen (15) minute street closing. Once the last unit has started on the
parade route, the department of public works will begin cleaning the street,
and the police department will reopen the street to traffic as street cleaning
is completed. Once the last parade unit has completed the parade route, all
parade participants must disperse from the street so that it may be safely
cleaned and reopened to traffic.
      (2)   Where the parade permit was limited to the sidewalk or one lane of
traffic based on the estimated number of parade participants and parade units,
and in the event that the number of participants in attendance exceeds
anticipated levels, members of the police department are authorized to make
reasonable accommodation to increase the portion of the public way made
available in order to preserve public health and safety.
Alternatively, where the number or size of parade participants or parade units
participating are substantially less than expected, members of the police
department are authorized to limit the available portion of the public way,
where one (1) lane of traffic or the sidewalk is capable of accommodating the
number of participants and parade units present.
   (o)   The chief of police, in consultation with other village departments
and agencies, is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to implement
this section.
   (p)   It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly interfere with any
person or organization lawfully conducting a parade.
   (q)   Any requirement for an application fee or obtaining insurance provided
for in this section shall be waived by the chief of police if the application
is for an activity protected by the 1st Amendment to the United States
Constitution and the requirement would be so financially burdensome that it
would preclude the applicant from applying for a parade permit for the proposed
activity. An application for a waiver of the application fee or insurance
requirement shall be made on a form prescribed by and contain reasonable proof
acceptable to, the chief of police.
   (r)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section, or any of
the provisions of the regulations promulgated hereunder, shall be fined not
less than $200 nor more than $1,000, or may be subject to incarceration for up
to ten (10) days, or both. In addition to any other penalty or fine provided,
any person who sells or transfers a permit granted under this section shall be
barred from applying for another such permit for a period of three (3) years.

based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
Village denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies
identified by the Village and resubmit the revised application once within
thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying
an additional application fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised
application within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the
application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised
application within thirty (30) days of denial shall require the applicant to
submit a new application with applicable fees, and result in recommencement of
the Village’s review period.
         c.   The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention
to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application. Any review of a revised application

(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-227 Effect of Permit.
   (a)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Article on rights-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Duration. 
      (1)   No permit issued under this Article shall be valid for a period
longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
      (2)   For permits to collocate wireless facilities, the collocation must
be complete within 180 days after the issuance of the permit, unless the
Village and the wireless provider agree to extend the period or a delay is
cause by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of
the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time
to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the Village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
      (3)   Permits to collocate small wireless facilities which meet the
timeliness requirements of the preceding paragraph shall be for a period of not
less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village
codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this Article.
   (c)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Article prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with
such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other facilities in the
area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other facilities,
use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress
by adjacent property owners.
   (d)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-228 Revised Permit Drawings.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this Article, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with Section
21-243. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-229 Collocation of Wireless Facilities.
   The following requirements and conditions, as outlined in this section
21-229, shall apply only to collocation of small wireless facilities, as
defined by this Article:
   (a)   Permitted Use. Collocation of small wireless facilities on municipal
utility poles is a permitted use in the right-of-way as long as such facilities
meet the requirements of this Article.
   (b)   Public Safety Space Reservation. The Village may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village’s
electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably
determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
   (c)   Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in a safe condition
and in good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of
this Article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
   (d)   Make-Ready Requirements.
      (1)   The Village may require make-ready work on an existing utility pole
to ensure structural integrity, compliance with an approved Village plan, or to
comply with any ordinance, law or regulation. The Village will not require more
make-ready work than required to meet applicable codes or industry standards.
Make-ready work may include work needed to accommodate additional public safety
communications needs that are identified in a documented and approved plan for
the deployment of public safety equipment as specified and included in an
existing or preliminary Village or public service agency plan. Fees for make-
ready work, including any municipal utility pole attachment, shall not exceed
actual costs or the amount charged to communications service providers for
similar work and shall not include any consultants’ fees or expenses for
municipal utility poles that do not support aerial facilities used to provide
communications services or electric service. Make-ready work, including any
pole replacement, shall be completed within sixty (60) days of written
acceptance of the good-faith estimate by the village at the wireless provider’s
sole cost and expense.
      (2)   For municipal utility poles that support aerial facilities used to
provide communications services or electric services, a wireless provider shall
comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. 224 and its
implementing regulations. Wireless providers shall follow a substantially
similar process for such make-ready work except to the extent that the timing
requirements are otherwise addressed by this Article. The good-faith estimate
of the person owning or controlling the Village’s utility pole for any make-
ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation
shall include municipal utility pole replacement, if necessary. Make-ready work
for utility poles that support aerial facilities used to provide communications
services or electric services may include reasonable consultants’ fees and
expenses
   (e)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies.
      (1)   The wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities
shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for
public safety communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless
facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable
interference with a public safety agency’s communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
      (2)   If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the
wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based
on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the
Code of Federal Regulations. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
   (f)   Electric Distribution or Transmission Systems. The wireless provider
shall not collocate small wireless facilities on municipal utility poles that
are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the
communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the
pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility
may be located in the communications space on the municipal utility pole and on
the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider
complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. For
purposes of this section, the terms “communications space”, “communication
worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the meanings given to
those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
   (g)   Public Safety. The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable

reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in any Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a
comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers
of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic
district.
   (i)   Alternate Placements. Except as provided in this Article, a wireless
provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which
the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure
on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure
does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by
the applicant. If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
   (j)   Height Limitations.
      (1)   The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more
than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on
which the small wireless facility is collocated.
      (2)   New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on
which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
Village, provided the Village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
   (k)   Height Exceptions or Variances. If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility has proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set
forth in Section
21-243.
   (l)   Contractual Design Requirements. The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.

(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-231 Indemnification.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility or
wireless provider shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing
or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Article or by a franchise, license,
or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility’s or wireless
provider’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Article by the
Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-232 Security.
   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Article;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Article; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Article including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Article to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Article or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form.  The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this Subsection (c) for any single phase.
   (d)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Article that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (e)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
Subsection (c) of this Section.
   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in Subsection (c) of this Section.
   (g)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this Article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

      (1)   No Future Disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle Passes, Culverts, or Drainage Facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   90 Degree Crossing Required. Crossing facilities shall cross at or
as near to a ninety (90) degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead Power or Communication Facility. An overhead power or

facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The Village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (g)   Utility Facilities Installed Above Ground.  Above ground utility
facilities may be installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (h)   Utility Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
      (1)   Utility facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or
roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means
of accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include,
but are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable
supports and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the
bridge or roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are
volatile, flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under
significant pressure or potential, present high degrees of risk and such
installations are not permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         a.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         b.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         c.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         d.   The proposed method of attachment;
         e.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the

to the risk involved.
   (i)   Not Applicable to Wireless Providers. The requirement under
Subsections (g) and (h) of this Section are only applicable to utilities, and
shall not apply to small wireless facility applicants. Wireless provider
applying to collocate small wireless facilities in the Village’s rights-of-way
must comply with he requirements of Section
21-229.
   (j)   Appearance Standards.
      (1)   The Village may require that utilities or wireless providers
install screening or otherwise camouflage facilities in particular locations in
order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not

(Ord. No. 23-2018 § 1, 8-20-18)
Sec. 21-238. Construction Methods and Materials.
   (a)   Standards and Requirements for Particular Types of Construction
Methods.
      (1)   Boring or Jacking.
         a.   Pits and Shoring.  Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the Director
of Public Works from the edge of the pavement. Pits for boring or jacking shall
be excavated no more than forty-eight (48) hours in advance of boring or
jacking operations and backfilled within forty-eight (48) hours after boring or
jacking operations are completed. While pits are open, they shall be clearly
marked and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be designed, erected,
supported, braced, and maintained so that it will safely support all vertical
and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it during the boring or jacking
operation.
         b.   Wet Boring or Jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         c.   Borings with Diameters Greater Than 6 Inches. Borings over six

practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Director of Public Works.
         b   Open Trench and Excavated Material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         c.   Drip Line of Trees. The utility or wireless provider shall not
trench within the drip line of any tree designated by the Village to be
preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         a.   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation of
facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT’s “Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction.” When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         b.   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility or wireless provider shall be responsible to
remove and restore any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of
the facility. If so ordered by the Director of Public Works, the utility or
wireless provider, at its expense, shall remove any pavement and backfill
material to the top of the installed facility, place and properly compact new
backfill material, and restore new pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to
the proper grades, as determined by the Director of Public Works.
      (4)   Pavement Cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this paragraph 4) is
permitted under Section
21-243, the following requirements shall apply:
         a.   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Director of Public Works.
         b.   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the Village.
         c.   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         d.   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or resurfaced in the last
three (3) years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to
be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before
the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         a.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
Village.
         b.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or Village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if: (1)
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and (2)
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         f.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

notify the utility or wireless provider, if known, after cutting or removing a
facility.
   (d)   Wireless Provider Options upon Removal of a Municipal Utility Pole.
The Village may eliminate above-ground utility poles as long as such decision
is made on a nondiscriminatory basis. In the event the Village chooses to
eliminate a utility pole upon which a small wireless facility is collocated,
the Village will either: (1) install and maintain a reasonable alternative
utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of the small
wireless facility, or (2) offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless
provider at a reasonable cost; or (3) allow the wireless provider to install
its own utility pole so it can maintain service from that location.
   (e)   Abandonment of Facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the Village, the utility or wireless provider shall notify the
Village within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the Village
may direct the utility or wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the
facility if the Director of Public Works determines that such removal will be
in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event
that the Village does not direct the utility or wireless provider that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
Village, the abandoning utility or wireless provider shall be deemed to consent
to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another
utility, wireless provider or person.
   (f)    Small Wireless Facilities- Deemed Abandoned. A small wireless
facility that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months

right-of-way, the utility or wireless provider shall take immediate steps to
provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on
the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If
a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility or wireless provider shall, as soon as
possible, notify the Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized
agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken
for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the
necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with
the free movement of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this Article
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (c)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility or
wireless provider (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line)
create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (d)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance.  As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility or
wireless provider requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this Article but
which carry out the purposes of this Article.
   (e)   Right to Appeal. Any utility or wireless provider aggrieved by any

   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Article shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of Section
1-9 of the Code. There may be times when the Village will incur delay or other
costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot
perform its duties under its permit and this Article. Unless the utility or
wireless provider shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility or wireless provider shall bear
the Village’s costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a
permit related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon
a utility or wireless provider that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   (c)   The commissioner shall not issue a permit for any allowable discharge
under this section without a prior permit having been issued by the MSD for
such discharge. When a permit has been issued by the MSD, the commissioner may
waive the fee and adopt the MSD permit.
(Code 1965, § 22-23(c), (d))
Sec. 24-236. Discretionary authority of commissioner.
   (a)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in section
24-235 or which are in violation of the standards for pretreatment provided in

to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
(Code 1965, § 22-23(f))
Sec. 24-238. Maintenance of preliminary treatment facilities.
Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense.
(Code 1965, § 22-23(g))
Sec. 24-239. Control manhole.
Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole; and, when
required by the commissioner, the owner of any property serviced by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole,
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building
sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such
manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the commissioner. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(Code 1965, § 22-23(h))
Sec. 24-240. Laboratory measurements, analyses.
   (a)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying

waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this article and any special
conditions for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
   (b)   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the village; but no less than once per
year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and
local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such a
manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village. At such times as
deemed necessary, the village reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an outside service.
   (c)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of
a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined from
periodic grab samples.
(Code 1965, § 22-23(i), (j))
Sec. 24-241. Special agreements.
   No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial
concern, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with this article, by the industrial concern, provided such payments
are in accordance with MSD, federal and state guidelines for user charge

appropriate use of individual parcels of land in the Village; and
      3.    Encourage compatibility between different land uses; and
      4.   Provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses that
adversely affect the character and value of permitted development; and
      5.   Protect the scale and character of the existing residential,
business, commercial, cemetery, industrial and office development areas of the

of the Zoning Board of Appeals; and may expressly set forth any limitations or
conditions recommended or imposed on any relief granted or recommended or work
or uses authorized.
   In any case where this Code provides that the failure of the Zoning Board of
Appeals to act shall be deemed a recommendation for grant or denial of an
application, such failure shall be considered to be a decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals rendered on the day following the expiration of such fixed
period, notwithstanding the absence of required findings and conclusions.
   I.   Conflicts. No member of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall participate
in the hearing or disposition of any matter in which that member has a property

Sec. 25-32. Enforcement Officer.
The Building Commissioner shall be charged with and responsible for the
enforcement and interpretation of the provisions of this Code.
Sec. 25-33. Site Plan Approval.
   A.   Authority. Pursuant to the provisions of this Code, the Building
Commissioner, as a matter of original jurisdiction and in accordance with the
procedures and standards set out in this Section, may grant site plan approval
to uses and developments requiring such approval.
   B.   Purpose. The site plan approval process recognizes that even those uses
and developments that have been determined to be generally suitable for
location in a particular district are capable of adversely affecting the
purposes for which this Code was enacted unless careful consideration is given
to critical design elements. It is the purpose of this Section to provide a
vehicle for the review of the developer's attention to such elements.
   C.   Site Plan Approval Required. Site plan approval by the Building
Commissioner in accordance with this Section shall be required in connection
with the following development:
      1.   Any residential or commercial development or redevelopment, other
than for one single family detached dwelling unit, or any addition, expansion,
or accessory building in conjunction therewith.
      2.   Any residential or commercial development or redevelopment involving
an existing structure, other than one which does not change the outside walls
of the structure and other than for one single family detached dwelling unit.
      3.   Any residential or commercial development or redevelopment involving
the creation or expansion of a parking lot or loading zone.
   D.   Procedure.  
      1.   Preapplication Conference.
         (a)   Request. In any case where site plan approval is required, the
applicant may by letter request a preapplication conference, prior to filing
his application, with the Building Commissioner.
         (b)   Required Information. Such request shall include a brief and
general description of the nature, location, and extent of the proposed project
and a list of any professional consultants advising the prospective applicant
with respect to the proposed project.
         (c)   Procedure. Upon receipt of such request, the Building
Commissioner shall promptly schedule such conference and notify the applicant
and appropriate staff members of the time and place of such conference and of
the names and attend. The Building Commissioner or his designee shall conduct
such conference, and its purpose shall be to broadly acquaint all other parties
with the proposals, views, and concerns of all other parties at a time when
positions are still flexible and adjustment is still possible.
      2.   Building Commissioner Approvals.
         (a)   Action by Building Commissioner. Within 21 days after receipt by
the Building Commissioner of a properly completed application, including all
information and changes requested, the Building Commissioner shall cause such
application and the attached site plan to be reviewed, in terms of the
standards established by this Section. He then shall either: (i) approve the
site plan as submitted; or (ii) on the basis of written findings in accordance
with this Section, approve it subject to specific modifications; or (iii) on
the basis of such findings, deny approval of the site plan.
Immediately upon concluding review, the Building Commissioner shall return one
copy of the site plan to the applicant marked to show either approval, approval
subject to modifications which modifications shall be clearly and permanently
marked on such plans, or denial of approval. The Building Commissioner shall
maintain a similarly marked set of such plans for any further processing that
may be required. The failure of the Building Commissioner to act within such 21
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to
be a decision approving the site plan as submitted.
         (b)   Effect of Building Commissioner's Action. The action of the
Building Commissioner in approving a site plan or in approving a site plan
subject to modifications that are acceptable to the applicant shall constitute
a final administrative action and shall not be subject to further review or
appeal. The action of the Building Commissioner in denying an application for
Site Plan Approval or in approving a site plan subject to modifications that
are not acceptable to the applicant (which action the applicant may treat as a
denial) shall not be considered final action by the Village but shall only be
authorization for the applicant to seek approval of the site plan from the
Zoning Board of Appeals by way of the appeal procedure set forth below.
         (c)   Appeals. Within 45 days after a denial of Site Plan approval by
the Building Commissioner, the applicant may seek approval of the site plan by
filing an application for appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      3.   Zoning Board of Appeals Approvals.
         (a)   Action by Building Commissioner in Appeal Cases. Upon receipt of
a properly completed application for an appeal of a denial of site plan
approval by the Building Commissioner, he shall forthwith transmit to the
Zoning Board of Appeals the application for appeal, the original application
for site plan approval, all papers constituting the record upon which the
Building Commissioner's denial was based, and a copy of the Building
Commissioner's decision denying the application for Site Plan approval.
         (b)   Public Hearing. A public hearing and formal notice is not
required by the Zoning Board of Appeals although its actions must be taken at a
public meeting.
         (c)   Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 35 days after the
conclusion of the public meeting, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall approve the
site plan as submitted, or shall make modifications acceptable to the applicant
and approve such modified site plan, or shall disapprove it in the manner
hereinafter specified. The failure of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within
such 35 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying site plan approval.
   E.   Standards for Site Plan Disapproval.
      1.   Standards. Neither the Building Commissioner nor the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall disapprove a site plan submitted pursuant to this Section except
on the basis of specific written findings directed to one or more of the
following standards:
         (a)   The application is incomplete in specified particulars or
contains or reveals violations of this Code or other applicable regulations
that the applicant, after written request, has failed or refused to supply or
correct.
         (b)   The application is submitted in connection with another
application, the approval of which is a condition precedent to the necessity
for site plan review, and the applicant has failed to secure approval of that
application.
         (c)   The site plan fails to adequately meet specified standards
required by this Code with respect to the proposed use or development,
including special use standards where applicable.
         (d)   The proposed site plan interferes with easements or rights-of-
way.
         (e)   The proposed site plan unreasonably destroys, damages,
detrimentally modifies, or interferes with the enjoyment of significant
natural, topographical, or physical features of the site.
         (f)   The proposed site plan is unreasonably injurious or detrimental
to the use and enjoyment of surrounding property.
         (g)   The proposed site plan creates undue traffic congestion or
hazard; in the public streets, or the circulation elements of the proposed site
plan unreasonably create hazards to safety on or off site or disjointed,
inefficient pedestrian or vehicular circulation paths on or off site.
         (h)   The screening of the site does not provide adequate shielding
from or for nearby uses.
         (i)   The proposed structures or landscaping are unreasonably lacking
amenity in relation to, or are incompatible with, nearby structures and uses.
         (j)   In the case of site plans submitted in connection with an
application for a special permit, the proposed site plan makes inadequate
provision for the creation or preservation of open space or for its continued
maintenance.
         (k)   The proposed site plan creates unreasonable drainage or erosion
problems or fails to fully and satisfactorily integrate the site into the
overall existing and planned drainage system serving the Village.
         (l)   The proposed site plan places unwarranted or unreasonable
burdens on specified utility systems serving the site or area or fails to fully
and satisfactorily integrate the site's utilities into the overall existing and
planned utility systems serving the Village.
         (m)   The proposed site plan otherwise adversely affects the public
health, safety, or general welfare.
      2.   Alternative Approaches. In citing any of the foregoing standards,
other than those of Subparagraphs 1(a) and 1(b), as the basis for disapproving
a site plan, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall suggest alternate site plan
approaches that could be developed to avoid the specified deficiency or shall
state the reasons why such deficiency cannot be avoided consistent with the
applicant's objectives.
   F.   Effect of Site Plan Approval. Approval of a site plan shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing
of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village.
   A copy of every approved site plan shall be filed with the Building
Commissioner and the development of the site shall be in substantial conformity
with such approved and filed plan.
   G.   Limitations on Site Plan Approval. Subject to an extension of time
granted by the Building Commissioner, no site plan approval shall be valid for
a period longer than one year unless a Building Permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion or unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is issued
and a use commenced within that period.
   H.   Adjustments to Site Plan During Development. During the development of
the site, the Building Commissioner may authorize minor adjustments to a site
plan originally approved by him or the Zoning Board of Appeals when such
adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or engineering
considerations first discovered during actual development.
Sec. 25-34. Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
   A.   Authority. The Building Commissioner shall have authority to issue
Certificates of Zoning Compliance; provided, however, that no such certificate
shall be issued except in accordance with the provisions of this Section and
the provisions of the Building Code and Fire Code.
   B.   Purpose. For the purposes of this Code, the Certificate of Zoning
Compliance provides a procedure for the inspection of completed premises to
ensure their compliance with this Code and approved plans prior to commencement
of the use or occupancy of such premises. The certificate may also evidence
compliance with other provisions of the Evergreen Park Municipal Code as set
forth in those provisions. It is intended that the Certificate of Zoning
Compliance shall be issued in conjunction with a Certificate of Occupancy
pursuant to the Evergreen Park Building Code when such a Certificate of
Occupancy is required thereby.
   C.   Certificate Required. Unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall
have first been obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of this
Code:
      1.   No structure, or addition thereto, constructed, reconstructed,
remodeled, altered, or moved after the effective date of this Code shall be
occupied or used for any purpose; and
      2.   No land vacant as of the effective date of this Code shall be used
or occupied for any purpose; and
      3.   Except for changes involving only substitution of occupants in
existing dwelling units, no use or occupancy of any land or structure shall be
changed to any other use or occupancy when such change involves construction,
remodeling, alteration, or moving, and
      4.   No home occupation shall be established or maintained.
   D.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for Certificates of Zoning Compliance
shall be filed with the Building Commissioner on forms supplied by the Village
and shall be accompanied by an application fee of $100.00. In any case where
the structure or use involved has been constructed or established pursuant to
any approval granted pursuant to this Code, the application shall be
accompanied by "as built" plans depicting the structure or use as built and
bearing the certificate of a surveyor, engineer, architect, land planner, or
owner-designer, as may be appropriate, certifying that the structure or use as
built conforms in all respects to the approval granted.
      2.   Action on Application. Within 10 days after the receipt of a
completed application, the Building Commissioner shall cause the subject
structure or premises to be inspected and shall take one of the following
actions based on such inspection:
         (a)   If all work has been completed and the structure and use thereof
are in full and complete compliance with all applicable provisions of this
Code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans
as approved, and any conditions attached to any approval issued pursuant to
this Code, the Building Commissioner shall issue a Certificate of Zoning
Compliance.
         (b)   If, however, all work is not complete or is in any manner not in
full compliance with all applicable requirements, the Building Commissioner
shall deny the application and shall inform the applicant in writing of the
specific deficiencies on which such denial is based, citing the particular
provisions of the codes and ordinances of the Village, the particular items in
the applicant's plans or the applicable special approval conditions with
respect to which compliance is lacking.
      3.   Contents of Certificate. In addition to the matters required to be
contained in a Certificate of Zoning Compliance pursuant to other applicable
provisions of the Evergreen Park Municipal Code, each Certificate of Zoning
Compliance issued pursuant to this Section shall state the specific use of the
subject property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if
any, pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set forth any conditions imposed
in connection with any approval granted pursuant to this Code.
      4.   Filing of Certificates. Every Certificate of Zoning Compliance
issued pursuant to this Section shall be kept on file in the Office of the
Building Commissioner.
   E.   Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Paragraph D2 of this Section, when construction, reconstruction,
or alteration of a structure does not require the vacating of the structure, or
when parts of the structure are finished and ready for occupancy before the
completion of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration and
are certified upon inspection to be safe for use or occupancy and to be in full
compliance with all applicable provisions of this Code, other relevant codes
and ordinances of the Village, the applicant's plans as approved and any
conditions attached to any approvals issued pursuant to this Code with respect
to such structure or its premises, a Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance
may be issued for a period not to exceed six months from its date, which
Temporary Certificate shall bear on its face, in bold type, a statement of its
temporary nature; provided, however, that no such Temporary Certificate shall
be issued pursuant to this Code unless said structure also qualifies for a
Temporary Certificate of Zoning Compliance issued pursuant to the Evergreen
Park Building Code.
   F.   Certificate of Zoning Compliance for Existing Uses. The Building
Commissioner may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance certifying the lawful
existence and use of any existing structure or use in the same manner, and
subject to the same standards and limitations, as authorized by this Section
with respect to new structures and uses. Such Certificate of Zoning Compliance
shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it with respect to any
structure or use as of the date of its issue and remain effective for that
purpose for so long as neither the use or structure nor the applicable
provisions of this Code are changed.
   G.   Certificate of Zoning Compliance for Legal Nonconformities. The
Building Commissioner may issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance certifying
the lawful existence and use of any nonconforming use, structure or lot in the
same manner, and subject to the same standards and limitations, as authorized
by this Section with respect to new structures and uses.
   H.   Void Certificates. Any Certificate of Zoning Compliance issued in
violation of the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently,
or innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights
whatsoever.
 Sec. 25-35. Administrative Deviations in Residential Districts.
The Building Commissioner, with the consent of the Mayor, shall have the
authority to grant an administrative deviation, without any public hearing or
without any public notice, as follows:
   A.   Decrease side yard setback requirements and rear yard setback
requirements by not more than 1 foot on each side yard and the rear yard for
any accessory structure.
   B.    Decrease side yard setback requirements by not more than 1 foot on
each side yard for the principal structure.

   F.   Decrease lot coverage requirements to not more than 45% of the lot
area.
   G.   Payment of $750 administrative processing fee.

      1.   Fee Established; Lien. Every application filed pursuant to this Code
shall be subject to a minimum application fee as established from time to time
by the Board of Trustees to recover the actual costs, as hereinafter defined,

actual costs exceed the minimum application fee, the balance shall be due
within 10 days after billing by the Village. The owner of the property subject
of the application and, if different, the applicant shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment of said fee. By signing the application, the
owner shall be deemed to have agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the
filing and foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to ensure collection
of any such fee, plus the costs of collection, which has not been paid within
30 days following the mailing of a written demand for such payment to the owner
at the address shown on the application. Any lien filed pursuant to this
Subsection may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or
mechanics liens.
       2.   Recoverable Costs. For purposes of establishing the application
fee, the actual costs incurred by the Village in processing an application
shall be deemed to consist of the following items of direct and indirect
expense:
         (a)   Legal Publication and posted sign (direct cost);

      3.   Condition of all Applications, Approvals, and Permits; Time Periods.
No application filed pursuant to this Code shall be considered complete unless
and until all fees and deposits due pursuant to this Subsection have been paid.
Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this Code, whether
or not expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned upon payment
of fees as required by this Subsection.
When this Code provides that the passage of time without decision or action
shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval, all time periods
shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment, but shall otherwise continue
to run.
The failure to fully pay any such fee or deposit when due shall be grounds for
refusing to process an application and for denying or revoking any permit or
approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development to which the
unpaid fee or deposit relates.
      4.   Waiver. The Board of Trustees may waive any or all of an application
fee. No application fee shall apply to the Village or any elected official

the Zoning Board of Appeals may deem necessary or appropriate to a full and
proper consideration and disposition of the particular application.
   F.   Waiver of Application Requirements. The Building Commissioner and the
Zoning Board of Appeals have the right to waive any documentation required by
them or required in this code.
   G.   Withdrawal of Application. An applicant may withdraw an application at
any time prior to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto.
Such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the applicant's right to refile
such application, but any such refiling shall be treated as an entirely new
filing and shall be subject to the procedures and fees of this Code in the same
manner as any other new application. No refund of any fees shall be made by
reason of a withdrawn application.
Sec. 25-41. Public Hearings.
   A.    Setting Hearing. When the provisions of this Code require a public

a matter referred back to the Zoning Board of Appeals by the Board of Trustees
is required.
   C.   Conduct of Hearings.
      1.   Rights of All Persons. Any person may appear and testify at a public
hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney, and may

ZONING DISTRICTS
Sec. 25-50. Establishment of Districts, Zoning Map.
To carry out the purposes of this Code, the Village is hereby divided into the
following zoning districts:
   "A" Single Family Residential District.
   "B" Multi-Family Residential District.
   "C" Commercial District.
   "I" Cemetery District.
   "O" Open Space Recreation District.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Code
are as shown on the map entitled "Zoning Map of the Village of Evergreen Park"
which is incorporated herein by reference. All notations, references, and other
information shown on the Zoning Map, and all amendments thereto, shall be as
much a part of this Code as if specifically set forth and literally described
herein.
Sec. 25-51. District Boundaries.
In the event that any uncertainty exists with respect to the intended
boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following
rules shall apply:
   A.   The district boundaries are the centerlines of highways, streets,
alleys, waterways, railroads, and other rights-of-way unless otherwise
indicated. When the designation of a boundary line on the Zoning Map coincides
with the location of any such right-of-way, the centerline of such right-of-way
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   B.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line, such lot line
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
   C.   When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary shall be
determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.

   B.   Purpose. Special uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that require a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the
desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses
that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a
weighing, in each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact
and effect.
   C.   Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for special use permits shall be filed
with the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      2.   Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      3.   Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 60 days after the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit to
the Board of Trustees its recommendation either granting the application for a
special use permit; granting the application subject to conditions, or denying
the application. The failure of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within such
60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
a recommendation for the denial of the proposed special use permit.
      4.   Action by Board of Trustees. Within 45 days after the receipt of the
recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the application or, by
ordinance duly passed, shall grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within
such 45 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed a decision denying the special use permit.
   D.   Standards for Special Use Permits.
      1.   General Standards. No special use permit shall be granted pursuant
to this Section unless the applicant shall establish that:
         (a)   Code and Plan Purposes. The proposed use and development will be
in harmony with the general and specific purposes for which this Code was
enacted and for which the regulations of the district in question were
established.
         (b)   No Undue Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will
not have a substantial or undue adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general welfare.
         (c)   No Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so as not to
dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with the use and development of
neighboring property in accordance with the applicable district regulations.
         (d)   Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and development
will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as
streets, public utilities, drainage structures, police and fire protection,
refuse disposal, parks, libraries, and schools, or the applicant will provide
adequately for such services.
         (e)   No Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will not
cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant amounts of traffic through
residential streets.
         (f)   No-Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of any natural,
scenic, or historic feature of significant importance.
         (g)   Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and development
complies with all standards imposed on that use and any district where it is a
permitted use.
      2.   Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall consider:
         (a)   Public Benefit. Whether and to what extent, the proposed use and
development at the particular location requested is necessary or desirable to
provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public
convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare of the neighborhood
or community.
         (b)   Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent, such public
goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and development at some
other site or in some other area that may be more appropriate than the proposed
site.
         (c)   Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent, all
steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the proposed
use and development on the immediate vicinity through building design, site
design, landscaping, and screening.
   E.   Conditions on Special Use Permits. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and
other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon the
premises benefited by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate
to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in
the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services;
provided, however, that such conditions shall not be used as a device to grant
a permit for a special use that is intended to be temporary in nature. Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special
use. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this
Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
   F.   Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions; Fee. Whenever any special use
permit granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, file an affidavit with the Building Commissioner so stating. Such
affidavit shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, to be fixed in each case
by the Building Commissioner, to recover the Village's actual direct cost of an
inspection to verify that such conditions and limitations have been met.
   G.   Effect of Issuance of a Special Use Permit. The grant of a special use
permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by
the codes and ordinances of the Village.
   H.   Limitations on Special Use Permits. Subject to an extension of time
granted by the Building Commissioner no special use permit shall be valid for a
period longer than one year unless a Building Permit is issued and construction
is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued and a use commenced
within that period.
   A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use
for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and cease
to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued
for a period of six consecutive months or more.
   Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance granting a special use
permit, a special use permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the
benefit of, the use and property in question rather than the owner or operator
of such use or property
   I.   Amendments to Special Use Permits. A special use permit may be amended,
varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards
and limitations provided in this Section for its original approval.

Sec. 25-61. Planned Developments.
   A.   Purpose. Planned developments are included in this Code as a distinct
category of special use. As such, they are authorized in every zoning district.
In particular, however, the planned development technique is intended to allow
the relaxation of otherwise applicable substantive requirements based upon
procedural protections providing for detailed review of individual proposals
for significant developments. This special regulatory technique is included in
this Code in recognition of the fact that traditional use, bulk, space, and
yard regulations which may be useful in protecting the character of
substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriate pre-
regulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or
areas that lend themselves to an individual, planned approach. Through the
flexibility of the planned development technique, the Village seeks to achieve
the following specific objectives:
      1.   Creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible
through strict application of other Village land use regulations.
      2.   Efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets while lowering development and housing costs.
      3.   Promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities resulting in better design and development, including
aesthetic amenities.
      4.   Combination and coordination of architectural styles, building
forms, and building relationships.
      5.   Preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such
as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features, and the prevention of
soil erosion.
      6.   Provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space.
      7.   An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result
from the application of conventional subdivision and zoning regulations.
      8.   Encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety
and general welfare.
   B.    Procedure.
      1.   Application. Applications for a planned development shall be filed
with the Zoning Board of Appeals and shall contain a Final Plan detailing:
         (a)   categories of uses to be permitted; and
         (b)   general location of residential and nonresidential land uses;
and
         (c)   overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of
nonresidential uses; and
         (d)   the general architectural style of the proposed development; and
         (e)   general location and extent of public and private open space
including recreational amenities; and
         (f)   general location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation
systems; and
         (g)   staging of development; and
         (h)   nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements,
or contributions to be provided by the applicant.
      2.   Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      3.   Subdivision. When a subdivision of land is proposed in connection
with a planned development, review of the final plat of the proposed
subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously with review of the Final Plan.
      4.   Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 60 days after the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit to
the Board of Trustees its recommendation either granting the application for
planned development; granting the application subject to conditions, or denying
the application. The failure of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within such
60 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
a recommendation for the denial of the proposed planned development.
      5.   Action by Board of Trustees. Within 45 days after the receipt of the
recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the application or, by
ordinance duly passed, shall approve the planned development, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within
such 45 days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed a decision denying the planned development.
   C.   Standards for Planned Developments. No planned development shall be
granted pursuant to this section unless the application shall establish that:
      1.   Special Use Permit Standards. The proposed development will meet
each of the standards made applicable to special uses pursuant to Section 25-60
of this Code.
      2   Unified Ownership Required. The entire property proposed for planned
development treatment shall be in single ownership or under such unified
control as to ensure that the entire property will be developed as a unified
whole. All owners of the property shall be included as joint applicants on all
applications and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any
owner as to any tract shall be deemed a violation as to all owners and all
tracts.
      3.   Minimum Area. The district regulations of this Code establishing
standards for particular types of planned developments specify the minimum area
required for some planned developments. In addition to meeting that specific
standard, or where no specific standard is set, the applicant shall have the
burden of establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and
shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole capable of meeting the
objectives for which planned developments may be established pursuant to this
Section.
      4.   Covenants and Restrictions to be Enforceable by Village. All
covenants, deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions to be
recorded in connection with the planned development shall provide that they may
not be modified, removed, or released without the express consent of the Board
of Trustees and that they may be enforced by the Village as well as by future
landowners within the proposed development.
      5.   Public Open Space and Contributions. Whenever the development will
create a need for land for public purposes of the Village within the proposed
planned development, the Board of Trustees may require that such area be
designated and to the extent such need is specifically and uniquely
attributable to the proposed development, dedicated to the Village for such
use. In addition, the Board of Trustees may require evidence that all
requirements of Village ordinances pertaining to the dedication of land or the
contribution of cash in connection with subdivisions or developments of land
have been met as respects the proposed planned development, whether or not such
proposed development would be otherwise subject to such ordinances.
      6.   Common Open Space.
         (a)   Amount, Location, and Use. The failure of a planned development
to provide common open space shall be considered to be an indication that it
has not satisfied the objectives for which such developments may be approved
pursuant to this Code. When common open space is provided in a planned
development, the amount and location of such open space shall be consistent
with its intended function as set forth in the application and planned
development plans. No such open space shall be used for the construction of any
structure or improvement except such structures and improvements as may be
approved in the Final Plan as appropriate to the intended leisure and
recreational uses for which such open space is intended.
         (b)   Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded covenants
or dedication of development rights, shall be provided to prevent the
subsequent use of common open space for any use, structure, improvement, or
development other than that shown on the approved Final Plan. The restrictions
must be permanent and not for a given period of years and must run with the
land.
         (c)   Ownership and Maintenance. The Final Plan shall include such
provisions for the ownership and maintenance of such open space and
improvements as are reasonably necessary to ensure their continuity, care,
conservation, maintenance, and operation in accordance with predetermined
standards and to ensure that remedial measures will be available to the Village
if such open space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or are not
maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the planned
development or the Village.
         (d)   Property Owners' Association. When the requirements of the
preceding Subparagraph are to be satisfied by the ownership or maintenance of
such open space or improvements by a property owners' association, such
association shall meet each of the following standards:
            (1)   the by-laws and rules of the association and all
declarations, covenants, and restrictions to be recorded must be approved as
part of the Final Plan prior to becoming effective. Each such document shall
provide that it shall not be amended in any manner that would result in it
being a violation of the requirements of this subparagraph; and
            (2)   the association must be established and all covenants and
restrictions must be recorded prior to the sale of any property within the area
of the planned development designated to have the exclusive use of the proposed
open space or improvements; and
            (3)   the association must be responsible for casualty and
liability insurance, taxes, and the maintenance of the open space and
improvements to be deeded to it; and
            (4)   membership in the association must be mandatory for each
property owner and any successive owner having a right to the use or enjoyment
of such open space or improvements; and
            (5)   every property owner having a right to the use or enjoyment
of such open space or improvements must pay its pro rata share of the cost of
the association by means of an assessment to be levied by the association that
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on the property in accordance with
statutes of the State of Illinois; and
            (6)   the association must have the right to adjust the assessment
to meet changed needs. The membership vote required to authorize such
adjustment shall not be fixed at more than two-thirds of the members voting on
the issue; and
            (7)   the Village must be given the right to enforce the covenants;
and
            (8)   the Village must be given the right, after 10 days' written
notice to the association, to perform any maintenance or repair work that the
association has neglected to perform, to assess the membership for such work
and to have a lien against the property for any member failing to pay such
assessment. For this purpose alone, the Village shall have all the rights and
powers of the association and its governing body under the agreements and
declarations creating the association.
      7.   Landscaping and Perimeter Treatment. Any area of a planned
development not used for structures or circulation elements shall be landscaped
or otherwise improved. The perimeter of the planned development shall be
treated so as to ensure compatibility with surrounding uses by means such as
provision of compatible uses and structures, setbacks, screening, or natural or
man-made buffers. Every planned development having 20 or more acres shall
provide a perimeter landscaped open space along each of its boundaries; each
such open space shall have a minimum depth equal to the minimum front yard
required in the district in which it is located or which it abuts, whichever is
greater.
      8.   Private Streets. Private streets are prohibited unless expressly
approved by the Board of Trustees. If so approved, they shall meet all
construction standards applicable to public streets. No such streets shall be
approved except upon the condition that they shall be owned and maintained by a
property owners' association.
      9.   Sidewalks. A sidewalk shall be provided along at least one side of
every street in or abutting a planned development; provided, however, that such
sidewalk may be constructed in a street right-of-way or as a specific element
of the design of the planned development.
      10.   Utilities. All utility lines shall be installed underground.
   D.   Conditions on Planned Developments. The Zoning Board of Appeals may
recommend and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and
other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon the
premises benefited by a planned development as may be necessary or appropriate
to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in
the vicinity of the subject property or upon public facilities and services;
provided, however, that such conditions shall not be used as a device to
approve a planned development that is intended to be temporary in nature. Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the planned
development. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation
of this Code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the planned
development approval.
   E.   Affidavit of Compliance with Conditions; Fee. Whenever any planned
development granted pursuant to this Section is made subject to conditions or
limitations to be met by the applicant, the applicant shall, upon meeting such
conditions, file an affidavit with the Building Commissioner so stating. Such
affidavit shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, to be fixed in each case
by the Building Commissioner, to recover the Village's actual direct cost of an
inspection to verify that such conditions and limitations have been met.
   F.   Effect of Approval of a Planned Development. The approval of a planned
development shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by
the codes and ordinances of the Village.
   G.   Limitations on Planned Development Permits. Subject to an extension of
time granted by the Building Commissioner no permit for a planned development
shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a Building Permit is
issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion or unless a Certificate of Occupancy is issued
and a use commenced within that period.
   A planned development permit shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any
reason, be discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or more.
   Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance approving a planned
development, a planned development permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be
for the benefit of, the use and property in question rather than the owner or
operator of such use or property
   H.   Amendments to Planned Development Permits. A planned development permit
may be amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject
to the standards and limitations provided in this Section for its original
approval.
ARTICLE VII
COMMUNITY RESIDENCES
Sec. 25-70. Responsibility.
The primary responsibility for enforcement of all regulations in this Code
pertaining to community residences, certifications and the issuance of
administrative permits, shall be in the zoning and development committee of the
board of trustees. The primary responsibility for the issuance of a building
permit, construction and compliance with all building regulations including

eligible for licensing or certification. Applicants to operate community
residences for which the state does not require licensing or certification
shall obtain a special use permit prior to obtaining an occupancy certificate.
The zoning and development committee of the board of trustees shall issue such
permits or certifications administratively. The board may revoke a certificate
of occupancy for a community residence if its license or certification, or the
operator's license or certification to operate community residences, is
revoked. A certificate of occupancy is not transferable to another operator or
to another location.
Sec. 25-72. Community Residence Permits.

   D.   Bench Seating. In stadia, auditoria, houses of worship, and other
places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or
other similar seating facilities, each 22 inches of seating facility shall be
counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off-
street parking facilities under this Code.
   E.   Population Calculations. When parking spaces are required on the basis
of the number of employees, customers, students, or similar measure, the
maximum number for which the structure is designed shall govern, except that
when the structure has no design capacity the maximum number present at any one
time shall govern.
Sec. 25-82. Parking Design and Maintenance.
All parking facilities shall meet the following requirements of design,
construction and maintenance:
   A.   Access to Street. No curb cut across public property shall exceed 30
feet without the written approval of the Building Commissioner. All parking
lots shall be so located and designed as to provide access to adjacent streets
with the least interference with through traffic movements. No access shall be
provided through a zoning district other than the district in which the parking
lot is located. No access shall be provided through a zoning lot other than the
zoning lot served by such access except across a permanent recorded access
easement.
   B.   Turn-Around Area. All parking lots and garages, other than a parking
lot to a single family or 2 family dwelling, shall be provided with a turn-
around area or other means to permit cars to exit the parking lot or garage
without backing onto any street or sidewalk.
   C.   Surfacing. All new and existing parking areas shall be improved with
paved brick, asphalt or concrete surface over a proper base. All construction
shall meet the minimum standards for structural materials derived from The
Illinois Department of Transportation Design Manual, current edition.
Individual stalls shall be clearly identified by painted markings 4" to 6" in
width.
   D.   Drainage. All parking areas shall provide adequate drainage of water to
the storm sewer system. Storm water run-off shall be detained on site in
accordance with applicable Village standards and ordinances of the Metropolitan
Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.
   E.   Screening and landscaping. All parking areas shall be screened on each
side abutting any property situated in a residential district or improved with
a residence by a wall, fence or densely planted hedge not less than 5 feet nor
more than 6 feet in height. Where a public alley exists between the parking
area and the residential district, and is used for ingress and egress to the
parking area, screening and landscaping shall be used only where in the opinion
of the building commissioner it is safe to do so.
   F.   Lighting. Fixed lighting shall be provided for all parking lots and
garages accommodating more than 10 vehicles. Any lighting used to illuminate
any parking area shall be directed away from adjoining properties. In no case
shall lighting exceed 3 foot candles measured at any lot line.

other than the temporary storage of motor vehicles related to the premises on
the zoning lot. The storage of merchandise and the sale or commercial repair of
vehicles are prohibited.

   All parking stalls shall access directly upon a aisle or driveway of such
design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access. All two-way
parking aisles must be at least 26 feet in width. Dead end parking aisles of
less than 26 feet in width and parking stalls where vehicles must back onto a
public street for access are prohibited. No driveway across public property at
the right-of-way line of a street shall exceed a width of 30 feet. No loading
area shall be counted as a parking stall. Storm water retention or detention is
prohibited in a parking lot if the water level for a 100-year rainfall
intensity will exceed 6 inches in any part thereof.
   M.   Handicapped Parking. Handicapped parking shall be provided in
conformance with the following table:
Total Parking Stalls in Lot Required Minimum Handicapped Stalls
1 to 25                     1
26 to 50                    2

The minimum width of handicapped stalls shall comply with State and Federal
law. Handicapped stalls shall be located closest to the nearest accessibility
entrance on an accessible route. Handicapped stalls may share a common access
aisle in order to meet minimum width requirements. Parking signs shall be
installed and maintained to identify handicapped parking stalls.
   N.   Change In Use. Whenever the use of any property, or any structure, or
part thereof, is changed to another use which requires a greater minimum number
of off-street parking spaces, such change in use is prohibited unless
additional off-street parking is provided to conform to the minimum
requirements.
   O.   Location. Required parking spaces shall be located on the same zoning
lot as the use which they serve or within 300 feet of such use provided such
off-lot parking spaces are located in the same or a less restrictive zoning
district and are located on property which is under the same ownership as the
use served or under a lease with a term of not less than 20 years. In the event
that such spaces cease to be under such control or cease to be used, then the
use on the zoning lot shall be terminated or reduced in conformity with the
number of required parking spaces available.
ARTICLE IX NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 25-90. General Provisions.
   A.   Purposes. This Article regulates and limits the continued existence of
uses, structures and lots established prior to the effective date of this Code
that do not conform to the regulations of this Code applicable in the zoning
districts in which such uses, structures and lots are located.
The zoning districts established by this Code are designed to guide the future
use of land within the Village by encouraging the development or maintenance of
areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to
promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The
continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the
purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual
elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
   B.   General Scope and Scheme of Regulation. Separate restrictions are
established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of structures
designed for a permitted use, nonconforming uses of structures not designed for
a permitted use, nonconforming structures, nonconforming lots of record. The
degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is
generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the
amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type.
   While the regulations of this Article related to nonconformities allow such
nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time, the
regulations restrict further investments that would make the nonconformity more
permanent, and the eventual elimination of the nonconformity is intended.
   C.   Exception for Repairs Pursuant to Public Order. Nothing in this Article
shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition
of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged
with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe
and orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such restoration is
not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this Article
prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed
structures.
   D.   Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No use or structure that
is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after
such principle use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it shall
thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located.
   E.   Burden of Owner to Establish Legality of Nonconformity. The burden of
establishing that any nonconformity is lawfully existing under the provisions
of this Article XII shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such
nonconformity and not upon the Village.
Sec. 25-91. Nonconforming Uses of Land and Nonconforming Uses in Structures
Designed for a Permitted Use.
   A.   Authority to Continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use not involving the use of a
structure, or involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming
use of land, or located in a structure designed for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations contained in Subsections B through
H of this Section and in Subsections D and E of Section 25-90 of this Code.
For purposes of this Section, any structure that is used in connection with a
nonconforming use of land and that has an assessed value of less than $5,000 on
the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto creating such
nonconformity shall be considered to be a structure accessory to a
nonconforming use of land.
   B.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls,
nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any
structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed
for a permitted use but devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use;
provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any
violation of Subsections C through I of this Section.
   C.   Structural Alteration. No structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless
the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new parking,
loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any
existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such
structure. For the purposes of this Subsection, the vertical or horizontal
extension of a structure shall be considered to increase the degree of an
existing nonconformity related to a required yard or setback.
   D.   Enlargement of Structure. No structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any
manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the use of such
structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in
which it is located. No such enlargement shall create any new parking, loading,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. For the
purposes of this Subsection, the vertical or horizontal extension of a
structure shall be considered to increase the degree of an existing
nonconformity related to a required yard or setback.
   E.   Extension of Use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is
accessory to a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in a structure
designed for a permitted use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being
limited to:
      1.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any
structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on
the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto that causes such use to
become nonconforming, and
      2.   An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a
building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not
occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code or any
amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming, and
      3.   An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal
hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or any amendment hereto
that causes such use to become nonconforming.
   F.    Moving. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land
or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part, for any
distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless
such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being so moved.
   G.   Change in Use. A nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or
involving only a structure that is accessory to the nonconforming use of land
or a nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in the
district in which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than a
use permitted in the zoning district in which the use or structure is located.
When such a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not
thereafter be changed back to any nonpermitted use. For purposes of this
Subsection G, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a permitted use shall have
commenced and continued for a period of five days. Any change of use in
violation of this Subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
lawfully existing nonconforming use.
   H.   Damage or Destruction. Any structure that is accessory to a
nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed, by
any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the cost of replacement of
such structure new shall not be restored unless the use of such structure shall
thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located and unless such restoration is accomplished without creating any new
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increasing the degree
of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to
such damage or destruction.
When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof to the extent of 50 percent or less of the cost of
replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such structure may
be made; provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall be made that
would create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increase the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity
existing prior to such damage or destruction, nor shall any repairs or
restoration except in conformity with the applicable zoning district
regulations be made unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is obtained and
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial
damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within
the control of the owner be repaired or restored except in accordance with
Subsections B, C, and D of this Section.
   I.   Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment. When a nonconforming use
of land not involving a structure or involving only a structure that is
accessory to the nonconforming use of land or when a nonconforming use of a
part or all of a structure that was designed for a use that is permitted in the
zoning district in which such structure is located is discontinued or abandoned
for a period of 12 consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume or
not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or
resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall comply
with the use regulations of the zoning district in which such land or structure
is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this Subsection.
Sec. 25-92. Nonconforming Uses in Structures Not Designed for a Permitted Use.
   A.   Authority to Continue. Except as provided in Subsection I of this
Section, any lawfully existing nonconforming use located in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which it is
located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
regulations contained in Subsections B through H of this Section and in
Subsections D and E of Section 25-90 of this Code.
   B.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls,
nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any
structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed
or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such structure is
located; provided, however, that this Subsection shall not be deemed to
authorize any violation of Subsections C through I of this Section.
   C.   Structural Alteration. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be structurally altered
unless the entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration
shall create a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increase the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity of such structure. For the purposes of this Subsection, the
vertical or horizontal extension of a structure shall be considered to increase
the degree of an existing nonconformity related to a required yard or setback.
   D.   Enlargement of Structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged or added to in
any manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the entire
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the regulations
of the district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new
parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of
any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such
structure. For the purposes of this Subsection, the vertical or horizontal
extension of a structure shall be considered to increase the degree of an
existing nonconformity related to a required yard or setback.
   E.   Extension of Use.
      1.   Prohibited Extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in
intensity by:
         (a)   An extension of such use to any structure or land area other
than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Code
or any amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming; or
         (b)   An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal hours of operation on the effective date of this Code or any amendment
to it that causes such use to become nonconforming.
      2.   Permitted Extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not
designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located may be extended throughout any part of such structure
lawfully existing on the effective date of this Code or any amendment to it
that causes such use to become nonconforming, provided, however, that such
extension shall not be allowed unless off-street parking and loading spaces
required for such extension can be, and are, provided in accordance with the
requirements and restrictions of this Code. No such extension shall be deemed
to affect the duty to terminate such use pursuant to Subsection I of this
Section.
   F.   Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use
and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
   G.   Change in Use. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or
intended for a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located
shall not be changed to any use other than a nonconforming use of a more
restricted classification or a use permitted in the zoning district in which
the structure is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted nonconforming use or to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be
changed back to a less restricted nonconforming use. For purposes of this
Subsection G, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a more restricted
nonconforming use or a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a
period of five days. Any change of use in violation of this Subsection shall be
deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing nonconforming use.
   H.   Damage or Destruction. Any structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended for any use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located that is damaged or destroyed, by
any means, to the extent of more than 50 percent of the cost of replacement of
such structure new shall not be restored unless such structure and the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located and unless such restoration is accomplished without
creating a new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increasing the degree of any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity of such structure existing prior to such damage or destruction.
When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof to the extent of 50 percent or less of the cost of
replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such structure may
be made; provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall be made that
would create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increase the degree of any parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity
of such structure existing prior to such damage or destruction nor shall any
repairs or restoration except in conformity with the applicable zoning district
regulations be made unless a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is obtained and
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial
damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within
the control of the owner be repaired or restored except in accordance with
Subsections B, C, and D of this Section.
   I.   Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment. When a nonconforming use
of a part or all of a structure that was not designed or intended for any use
permitted in the zoning district in which such structure is located is
discontinued or abandoned for a period of 12 consecutive months, regardless of
any intent to resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter
be re-established or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure
shall comply with the use regulations of the district in which such structure
is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this Subsection.
Sec. 25-93. Nonconforming Structures.
   A.   Authority to Continue. Any nonconforming structure that is devoted to a
use that is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions
in this Section and Section 25-90.
   B.   Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, and Enlargement. Any nonconforming
structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged; provided, however,
that no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or enlargement shall either
create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing
nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. For the purposes of this
Subsection, the vertical or horizontal extension of a structure shall be
considered to increase the degree of an existing nonconformity related to a
required yard or setback.
   C.   Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part,
for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot
unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being moved.
   D.   Damage or Destruction. Any nonconforming structure that is damaged or
destroyed, by any means not within the control of the owner thereof, to any
extent, may be repaired or restored; provided, however, that no repair or
restoration shall be made that would create any new nonconformity not existing
prior to such damage or destruction nor shall any repair or restoration except
in conformity with the applicable district regulations be made unless a
Certificate of Zoning Compliance is obtained and restoration is actually begun
within one year after the date of such damage or destruction and is diligently
pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within
the control of the owner be repaired or restored except in accordance with
Subsection B of this Section.
Sec. 25-94. Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
   A.    Authority to Utilize for Dwellings. In any district in which dwellings
are a permitted use, notwithstanding the regulations imposed by any other
provisions of this Code, a dwelling of the type permitted in the district in
which the lot is located and that complies with the restrictions of Subsection
B of this Section may be erected on a legal nonconforming lot of record that
has a total lot area equal to at least 70 percent of the total lot area
required in the district in which such lot is located.
   B.   Regulations for Single Family Use of Nonconforming Lots. A legal
nonconforming lot of record authorized to be used pursuant to Subsection A of
this Section may be used for a dwelling of the type permitted in the district
in which the lot is located and permitted accessory structures, but for no
other structure. Construction of such dwelling and accessory structures shall
comply with all the regulations applicable to dwellings and accessory
structures in the zoning district in which the lot in question is located,
except that the following lot area requirements shall apply in place of the lot
area requirements otherwise applicable:
      1.   Total lot area shall equal at least 70 percent of the district
requirement for the type of dwelling, and
      2.   Lot area per unit shall equal or exceed the district requirement,
except that one detached single family dwelling may be constructed with only 70
percent of the required lot area per unit.
    C.   Other Uses of Nonconforming Lots. In any zoning district in which
dwellings are not permitted, a legal nonconforming lot of record may be used
for any use permitted in the district in which it is located, if, but only if,
the development of such lot meets all requirements of the district in which it
is located, including floor area ratio and yard requirements, except lot area,
width, and depth requirements.
Sec. 25-95. Nursing and Personal Care Facility.
Any nursing and personal care facility which lawfully existed on the date of
the passage of this ordinance shall be a legal non-conforming use subject to
the provisions of Article IX, Nonconformities. In order to be lawfully
existing, the nursing and personal care facility must have a current valid
license from the State of Illinois issued under the Nursing Home Care Act.
Because of the effect that such facilities have shown upon neighboring
residential areas, the continuation of any legal non-conforming use is subject
to the following limitations:
   A.   There shall be no increase in the number of beds for which the facility
is permitted by the Illinois Department of Public Health.
   B.   There shall be no increase in the number of beds in any category (such
as skilled beds, intermediate beds, etc.) for which the facility is permitted
by the Illinois Department of Public Health.
   C.   No new patients shall be admitted under the categories of Aggressive/
Anti-Social and Drug Addiction. Any existing patients in such categories may
remain, but upon their removal from the facility, no new patient may replace
the same if admitted under the above categories.
   D.   On-site parking requirements shall be not less than one parking place
for each three beds for which the facility is permitted by the Illinois
Department of Public Health plus one parking space for each member of the staff
as determined by taking the most recent total staff (including full-time and
part-time) as reported by the Illinois Department of Public Aid and divided by
three. To the extent that a facility does not meet this on-site parking
requirement, no new patients shall be admitted, even if replacing existing
patients who are removed from the facility.
