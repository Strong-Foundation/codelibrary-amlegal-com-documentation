roll of members shall be called, and if a quorum be present the presiding
officer shall cause the journal of the last preceding meeting or meetings to be
read unless such reading be dispensed with by vote of the City Council.
   Rule 2. The Mayor shall preserve order and decorum. He may speak to points
of order in preference to any member and shall decide points of order subject
to an appeal of the City Council members by any two members, on which appeal no
member shall speak more than once unless by leave of the City Council.
   Rule 3. Every question shall be distinctly stated by the Mayor before it is
open for debate. Every motion shall be reduced to writing if the Mayor or any
member shall so demand.
   Rule 4. The presiding officer may call on any member to perform the duties
of chairman; no such substitution, however, shall extend beyond the adjournment
of the particular meeting.
   Rule 5. Every member previous to speaking to any question shall audibly
address the presiding officer as “Mr. Mayor”. Such member shall not, however,
speak further until he is recognized and named; provided, however, that any
member shall be given the floor on request of any two members of the City
Council.
   Rule 6. All ordinances shall be presented in written form prior to vote
thereon.
   Rule 7. Every member present when a vote is taken shall vote unless excused
by the City Council or unless he shall be directly interested in the matter
pending in which case such member shall not vote.
   Rule 8. All committees to whom any matter may be referred shall report in
writing if requested by any member. Minority reports may be submitted signed by
the dissenting member or members.
   Rule 9. On the acceptance of a final report from a special committee, such
committee shall stand discharged without vote unless it be otherwise ordered.
All reports made by committees or officers of the city, all resolutions
adopted, all ordinances as presented and passed, all communications, petitions
and the like received, and generally all papers presented to be acted on shall
be filed and carefully preserved by the Clerk.
   Rule 10. All petitions or communications shall be addressed to the City
Council and shall be in writing and filed by the Clerk.
   Rule 11. When a member wishes to present a communication, petition, order,
resolution or other original matter, he shall briefly state its nature before
presenting the same.
   Rule 12. No person, except during the open portion of the meeting and except
a member of the City Council, shall be permitted to address the City Council
without the consent of the City Council.
   Rule 13. The presiding officer shall decide all questions of order subject
to an appeal of the City Council by any two members, and in all cases not
covered by these rules, or where they are not applicable, the Board shall be
governed by Parliamentary Law as laid down in “Robert’s Rules of Order”.
   Rule 14. When a question is before the City Council no motions shall be in
order but to adjourn, lay on the table, previous question, postpone
indefinitely, postpone to a certain time, to commit, and amend. These motions
shall be privileged and have precedence in the order named.
   Rule 15. Any Alderman may object to the consideration or vote upon any main
motion regarding new business on the date said motion is first presented. If
there is any objection, said motion shall be deferred to the agenda of the next
meeting.
   Rule 16. When the meeting is open to the public, all persons wishing to
speak or pose any questions must identify themselves as to name and address. No
person shall be recognized by the chairman more than once at each meeting. Each
person recognized shall have the floor for three minutes.
   Rule 17. The journal of proceeding of the meetings shall be comprised of,
and limited to, the following:
   (a)   The date and place held;
   (b)   The names of the members and the city officials present;
   (c)   The nature and disposition of all motions;
   (d)   Copies of all ordinances and resolutions adopted and passed;
   (e)   Brief summaries of all reports submitted.
   Rule 18. Rules Governing Debate. Until a matter has been brought before the
City Council in the form of a motion proposing a specific action, it cannot be
debated. The motion must be made by an Alderman who has obtained the floor,
while no motion is pending, after which it must be seconded by another
Alderman. The term “debate” applies to the discussion in a deliberative
assembly on the merits of a pending motion. After the maker of the motion has
been given the opportunity to speak first if he wishes, other Aldermen of the
City Council may address the Chair to claim the floor for the purpose of
debate. No Alderman may speak more than twice to the same motion on the same
day. An Alderman may speak no longer than five minutes for each time he has the
floor to debate a motion. Rights in regard to debate are not transferable. No
Alderman may yield any unexpired portion of his time to another Alderman, or
reserve any portion of his time for a later time; that is, if an Alderman
yields the floor before speaking his full five minutes, he is presumed to have
waived his right to the remaining time. If a speaker yields to another Alderman
for an answer to a question, the time consumed by the answer to the question is
charged to the speaker. An Alderman who has spoken twice on the particular
motion on the same day has exhausted his right to debate that motion for that
day.
   Confining Remarks to the Merits of the Pending Question. In debate an
Alderman’s remarks must be germane to the motion before the City Council; that
is, his statements must have bearing on whether the pending motion should be
adopted.
   Refraining from Attacking an Alderman’s Motives. When a motion is pending, a
member can condemn the nature or likely consequences of the proposed measure in
strong terms, but he must avoid personalities, and under no circumstances can
he attack or question the motives of another Alderman.
   The measure, not the man, is the subject of debate. If an Alderman disagrees
with a statement by another in regard to an event which both witnessed, he
shall not state in debate that the other’s statement “is false”. But he might
say, “I believe there is strong evidence that the member is mistaken.” The
moment the Chair hears such words as “fraud”, “liar” or “lie” used about an
Alderman in debate or personal attacks on an Alderman, he must act immediately
and decisively to correct the matter and prevent its repetition. Speakers must
address their remarks to the Chair, maintain a courteous tone, and especially
in reference to any divergence of opinion should avoid injecting a personal
note into debate. To this end, the Alderman must never attack or make any
allusion to the motives of members.
   Rule 19. Rules for the Agenda of City Council Meetings. When a member of the
City Council wishes to present a communication, petition, order, resolution,
motion, ordinance or other original matter before the City Council for action
to be taken at the City Council meeting, he shall be required to present a
brief written statement of the nature of this item to the City Clerk’s office
at least two days prior to the City Council meeting.
   The City Clerk’s office shall accept the written statements submitted two
days prior to the City Council meeting and shall publish an agenda of items to
be acted on at the City Council meeting. This agenda shall be made available
for all members of the City Council the day before the City Council meeting.
§ 2.07 COMMITTEES.
   (a)   All standing and special committees of the City Council shall consist
of three or more Aldermen, and shall be appointed and confirmed by a majority
vote of the City Council. The City Council shall designate the chairman
thereof.
   (b)   The Mayor shall be ex-officio a member of all committees. The standing
committees to be appointed annually shall be:

      4.   Building

discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within any right-of-
way. Utilities or wireless providers that are not required by law to enter into
such an agreement may request that the City enter into such an agreement. In

collocated upon new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
      (6)   Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small
wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant shall
enter into a Master Pole Attachment Agreement provided by the City for the
initial collocation on a municipal utility pole. For subsequent approved
permits to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the
City and the applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of the Master Pole
Attachment Agreement.
      (7)   The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         b.   A local, State or federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
   (w)   Additional City Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the City that it intends to commence
work governed by this Section for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the City not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed,
used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
(i) 10 days after service of notice to the City by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
(ii) 25 days after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the
case of work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this Section.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the City, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Subsection (w)(1) the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the City an application for a
permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of Subsection (n).
   (x)   Additional City Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the City, unless otherwise acted upon by the City, provided the
holder has complied with applicable City codes, ordinances, and regulations.
   (y)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Section on any right-of-way, and does not
create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the
rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (z)   Duration of Utility Permits. No permit issued under this Section shall
be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is
actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.
   (aa)   Duration of Small Wireless Facility Permits. Wireless providers must
complete collocation of small wireless facilities within 180 days after the
issuance of a permit therefor, unless the City and the wireless provider agree
to extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal
utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the
site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and
the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after
issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the City
grants an extension in writing to the applicant. Permits for small wireless
facilities which are constructed within the foregoing timeframes shall be for a
period of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for
equivalent durations unless the City makes a finding that the small wireless
facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with applicable
City codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this
Section.
   (bb)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Section prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the City with
such City representatives in attendance as the City deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including without limitation, presence or absence of other facilities in the
area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other facilities,
use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress
by adjacent property owners.
   (cc)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
City does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the City and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
   (dd)   Revised Permit Drawings. In the event that the actual locations of
any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in
the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application,
the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City
within 90 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings
or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation
from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this Section, it shall
be treated as a request for variance. If the City denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-
of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit
revised drawings or plans therefor.
   (ee)   Collocation of Small Wireless Facilities. The following requirements
and conditions shall only Apply to collocation of small wireless facilities, as
defined by this Section:
      (1)   Permitted Use. Small wireless facilities are permitted uses in the
City’s rights-of-way as long as such facilities meet the requirements of this
Section or have obtained a variance from the City for any non-compliance with
this Section.
      (2)   Public Safety Space Reservation. The City may reserve space on
municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City’s electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      (3)   Installation and Maintenance. The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in a safe condition
and in good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of
this Section. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      (4)   Make-Ready Requirements for Utility Poles with no Aerial
Facilities. The City may require make-ready work on an existing utility pole to
ensure structural integrity, compliance with an approved City plan, or to
comply with any ordinance, law or regulation. The City will not require more
make-ready work than required to meet applicable codes or industry standards,
Make-ready work may include work needed to accommodate additional public safety
communications needs that are identified in a documented and approved plan for
the deployment of public safety equipment as specified and included in an
existing or preliminary City or public service agency plan. Fees for make-ready
work, including any municipal utility pole attachment, shall not exceed actual
costs or the amount charged to communications service providers for similar
work and shall not include any consultants’ fees or expenses for municipal
utility poles that do not support aerial facilities used to provide
communications services or electric service. Make-ready work, including any
pole replacement, shall be completed within 60 days of written acceptance of
the good-faith estimate by the City at the wireless provider’s sole cost and
expense.
      (5)   Make-Ready Requirements for Utility Poles which Support Aerial
Facilities. For municipal utility poles that support aerial facilities used to
provide communications services or electric services, a wireless provider shall
comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and its
implementing regulations. Wireless providers shall follow a substantially
similar process for such make-ready work except to the extent that the timing
requirements are otherwise addressed by this Section. The good-faith estimate
of the person owning or controlling City’s utility pole for any make-ready work
necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation shall include
municipal utility pole replacement, if necessary. Make-ready work for utility
poles that support aerial facilities used to provide communications services or
electric services may include reasonable consultants’ fees and expenses.
      (6)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies. The
wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 C.F.R. §§
22.970 through 22.973 and 47 C.F.R. §§ 90.672 through 90.675. The City may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal
Regulations. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall
constitute a public nuisance.
      (7)   Electric Distribution or Transmission Systems. The wireless
provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on municipal utility
poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within
the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of
the pole. However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the municipal utility
pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this section, the terms “communications space”, “communication
worker safety zone”, and “electric supply zone” have the meanings given to
those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (8)   Compliance with Public Safety Codes. The wireless provider shall
comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that
concern public safety.
      (9)   Compliance with Written Design Standards. The wireless provider
shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for
decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic
requirements that are set forth in any City ordinance, written policy adopted
by the City, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to
other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a
historic district.
      (10)   Alternate Placements. Except as provided in this Section, a
wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities
on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation which
the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure
on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure
does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by
the applicant. If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
      (11)   Height Limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless
facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless
support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. New or
replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
         b.   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
      (12)   Height Exceptions or Variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility has proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in Subsection (nnnn)-(rrrr) of this Section.
      (13)   Contractual Design Requirements. The wireless provider shall
comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   (ff)   Required Insurance Coverages and Limits for Utilities. Unless
otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility
occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall
secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the
utility as named insured and naming the City, and its elected and appointed
officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the
policies listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X,” “C,” and “U” coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         (i)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         (ii)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         (iii)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one minion dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (gg)   Required Insurance Coverages and Limits for Wireless Providers.
Wireless providers shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Worker’s compensation insurance, required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the right-of-way to afford minimum protection limits in the
amounts described in Subsection (ff)(1)(i)-(iii) above.
   The wireless provider shall include the City as an additional insured on a
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the City in a commercial general liability policy prior to the
collocation of any small wireless facility.
   (hh)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (ii)   Copies Required. The utility or wireless provider shall provide
copies of any of the policies required by this Section to the City within ten
(10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
   (jj)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the City,
by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no
event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility or
wireless provider shall obtain and furnish to the City evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (kk)   Self-Insurance. A utility or wireless provider may self-insure all or
a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by
Subsections (ff) and (gg) of this Section. A utility or wireless provider that
self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply
with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Subsections
(ff) and (gg), or the requirements of Subsections (hh), (ii) and (jj) of this
Section. A utility or wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
Subsections (ff) and (gg) of this Section, such as evidence that the utility or
wireless provider is a “private self insurer” under the Workers Compensation
Act, 820 ILCS 305/1.
   (ll)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility’s or Wireless
Provider’s Liability. The legal liability of the utility or wireless provider
to the City and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the
insurance policies or self-insurance required by this Section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
   (mm)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this Section
shall be affected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
   (nn)   Indemnification. By occupying or constructing facilities in the right
of-way, a utility or wireless provider shall be deemed to agree to defend,
indemnify and hold the City and its elected and appointed officials and
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any
and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses,
including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out
of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent,
careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the
utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-
way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such
acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Section or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility’s
or wireless provider’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Section by
the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
   (oo)   Security/Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this Section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Section;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this Section; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages; claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Section including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Section to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this Section or any other applicable law.
   (pp)   Security Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the
City in the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant
to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the City and within the State of
Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (qq)   Security Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-
of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works,
and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates
are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration.
Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be
performed in phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase
consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of
locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
Director of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each
phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for
phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this Subsection for any single phase.
   (rr)   Security Withdrawals. The City, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the City for such
amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if
the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Section that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (ss)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund,
the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
Subsection (qq) of this Section.
   (tt)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the City,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the City, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in Subsection (qq) of this Section.
   (uu)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Section or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (vv)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the City with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether
reserved by this Section or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
   (ww)   Permit Suspension and Revocation. The City may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this Section for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this Section;
      (3)   Permittee’s physical presence or presence of permittee’s facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee’s failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (xx)   Notice of Revocation or Suspension. The City shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
Section stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this Section.
   (yy)   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or
Suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the City, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the City with evidence that no cause exists for
the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the City, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the City within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the City providing written proof of such removal to the
City within ten (10) days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
   The City may, in its discretion for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this Subsection.
   (zz)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of
revocation or suspension, the City may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within Subsection (ww)
of this Section.
   (aaa)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee
fails to comply with the provisions of Subsection (yy) of this Section, the
City or its designee may, at the option of the City: (1) correct the
deficiencies; (2) upon not less than 20-days’ notice to the permittee, remove
the subject facilities or equipment; or (3) after not less than 30-days’ notice
to the permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the City. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the City
for all costs of removal.
   (bbb)   Change of Ownership or Owner’s Identity or Legal Status. A utility
or wireless provider shall notify the City no less than 30 days prior to the
transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way or change in identity
of the utility or wireless provider. The new owner of the utility, wireless
provider or facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by
the former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this Section, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (ccc)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the City’s right-of-
way.
   (ddd)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding
must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
   (eee)   General Construction Standards and Principles. All construction in
the right-of-way shall be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws,
rules and regulations, and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and

the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility or
wireless provider (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line)
create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that

costs, including third party claims, because the utility or wireless provider
will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this Section. Unless
the utility or wireless provider shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility or wireless
provider shall bear the City’s costs of damages and its costs of installing,
maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the
subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review

         C.   unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works;
         D.   unusual volume of flow or concentrations of wastes constituting
“slugs” as defined herein.
      12.   Water or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdictions over
discharge to the receiving waters.
   (e)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in paragraph (d) or which are in violation of
the Standards for pretreatment provided in Chapter 1, EPA Rules and
Regulations, Subchapter D, Water Programs Part 128 - Pretreatment Standards,
Federal Register Volume 38, No. 215, Thursday, November 8, 1973 and any
amendments thereto, and which in the judgment of the city or MWRD may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the city or MWRD may:
      1.   reject the wastes;
      2.   require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      3.   require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
      4.   require payment to cover the added costs of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges, under the provisions
of paragraph (k).
   If the City and MWRD permit the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the city, and subject to the requirements of all
applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the city or MWRD they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the city and MWRD and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   (g)   Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective
operation by the owner at his expense.
   (h)   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the city or MWRD, the owner of any property serviced by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole
together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building
sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such
manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be
constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city and MWRD. The manhole
shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him
so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (i)   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests, and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this ordinance and any special
conditions for discharge established by the city or MWRD.
   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the city or MWRD but no less than once per year
the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and
local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the city and MWRD at such times and in
such manner as prescribed by the city. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the city or MWRD. At such
times as deemed necessary, the city or MWRD reserve the right to take
measurements and samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (j)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four (24) hour composite of all
outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should
be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH’s are determined
from periodic grab samples.)
   (k)   No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city, MWRD and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the city for transmission, and MWRD for treatment, subject
to payment, therefore, in accordance with Section 7.09 hereof, by the
industrial concern, provided such payments are in accordance with federal and
state guidelines for User Charge System.
§ 7.07 PROTECTION OF SEWAGE WORKS FROM DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break,
damage, destroy or tamper with any structure, appurtenance, or equipment which
is a part of the sewage works. Any person violating this provision shall be
subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct.
§ 7.08 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)   The City, or authorized employees of other governmental bodies may
enter upon private property for the purpose of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, and testing provided that permission to enter has been
given by the property owner or occupant. The City, or authorized employees of
other governmental bodies may enter upon private property upon which there is
an easement for the purposes of constructing, maintaining, inspecting, and
repairing the public sewer.
   (b)   Where no consent has been given to enter or inspect upon private
property, no entry or inspection shall be made without the procurement of a
warrant from the Circuit Court of Cook County. That Court may consider any of
the following factors, along with such other matters as it deems pertinent, in
its decision as to whether a warrant shall issue:
      1.   Eyewitness account of violations.
      2.   Citizen complaints.
      3.   Tenant complaints.
      4.   Plain view violations.
      5.   Violations apparent from City records.
      6.   Age and nature of property.
      7.   Similar properties in the area.
      8.   Documented violations of similar properties.
      9.   Previous violations.
      10.   Tests.
      11.   Passage of time.
   (c)   Cause for issuance of a warrant shall be deemed to exist in light of
reasonable legislative and administrative standards which show that there is
reason to believe that a condition of non-conformity exists with respect to a
particular property in violation of any provisions of this chapter.
§ 7.09 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The wastewater service charge shall consist of a basic user charge for
operation and maintenance of the system (including replacement, capital
improvement, and equipment replacement) plus a debt service charge. The debt
service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt service by the
number of billable customers and dividing by 12 for a monthly charge. The basic
user charge shall be computed so that there shall be sufficient annual revenue
for the operation and maintenance of the system (including replacement, capital
improvement, and equipment replacement). The wastewater service charge shall be
revised periodically by the City Council to reflect cost changes.
   (b)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges shall be the
water consumptions taken from metered readings.
      1.   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the City water system, all
or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall
install and maintain, at his expense, water change, volume or reading device of
a type approved by the City for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
      2.   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the City if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered
water consumption records.
      3.   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the City.
       4.   If the user can prove through metering devices, installed at his
expense and approved by the City, that a portion of the water he uses is not
entering the sanitary sewer system, the City may make adjustments for future
billing.
   (c)   A debt service charge of $0 per month is hereby established.
   (d)   Residential, Commercial and Industrial Users. A basic user charge of
$4.70 per month plus $1.85 per thousand gallons is hereby effective for all
billings after September 1, 2025. A basic user charge of $2.20 per thousand
gallons is hereby effective for all billings after September 1, 2026, is hereby
established.
(Ord. 18-8, passed 6-14-2018; Ord. 25-13, passed 8-14-2025)
§ 7.10 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Bills. The wastewater service charge shall be payable by the owner of
the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service who shall be
jointly and severally liable. Service is furnished to the premises by the city
only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of
the services are jointly and severally liable therefor to the city which
condition may be required in writing prior to connection or initiation of
service.
   All sewer bills are due and payable 20 days after being sent out. Bills
shall be sent out in conjunction with water bills for the same billing periods
as water bills.
   (b)   Delinquent bills. Whenever any such charges shall remain delinquent
for a period of more than 30 days, the City Clerk shall cause a notice of
delinquency to be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested to the party
responsible for payment of the sewer bill at the address shown for said party
on the records of the city, with a copy of said notice being sent to or posted
upon the premises being served with water. Said notice shall state in substance
that if the delinquent sewer bill is not paid within 10 days from the date of
the notice, the water and sewer services to the supplied premises will be
turned off. Upon the expirations of the aforesaid 10 day period and in the
event that the delinquent sewer bill has not been paid, water and sewer service
to the supplied premises of the delinquent consumer shall be turned off and
said water and sewer services shall not be resumed until all sewer bills
including delinquencies have been paid. In addition thereto, a charge of $25
shall be made by the city for turning on and restoring the water services to
the premises. However, whenever the water service temporarily turned off at the
request of any consumer and the meter is not removed and there is no
delinquency in payment of water and sewer charges, the consumer shall pay the
regular minimum rate per billing period, but shall not be required to pay the
aforesaid charge of $25 for turning on the water when requested.
   No person owing water and sewer charges and removing to other premises where
there are water and sewer connections or where connections shall afterwards be
made, shall be supplied with water until such charges in arrears are paid in
full.
   (c)   Lien. Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid, the city may
file with the County Recorder of Deeds a lien.
   (d)   Revenues. All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the
wastewater collection system shall be credited to the sewerage account of the
sewerage fund.
   (e)   Accounts. The city shall establish a system of accounts and shall keep
books and records in which complete entries shall be made of all transactions
relative to the sewerage system, which shall be audited as all city records.
   In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report
or other report shall also reflect the revenues and operating expenses of the
wastewater collection system, including a replacement cost, to indicate that
sewer service charges under the waste cost recovery system do in fact meet
these regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the
report shall also include the following:
      1.   Billing data to show total number of gallons billed.
      2.   Debt service for the next succeeding fiscal year.
      3.   Number of users connected to the system.
      4.   Number of non-metered users.
   (f)   Notice of rates. Each user shall be notified, at least annually of the
rate and the wastewater service charge.
   (g)   Access to records. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency or
authorized representative shall have access to any books, documents, papers and
records of the city which are applicable to the city system of user charges for
the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions thereof
to insure compliance with the terms of the Special and General conditions to
any State Grant.
§ 7.11 MAINTENANCE OBLIGATIONS.
   The proper maintenance and operation of a building service sewer, house
connection or sanitary sewer line to the point of the public right of way shall
be the responsibility of the owner of the premises served by the same except
where the problem is caused by the owner (or occupant) of the premises. The
owner shall be responsible for all costs of maintenance and repair of that
portion because his premises have the exclusive use thereof. Before the city

blockage and repair needed is under the public right of way, and has not been
caused by the property owner (or occupant) the city shall repair the same. The
city shall assume all costs of maintenance and repair of the main sewer lines
and manholes. The owner of any premises whose discharge causes a blockage or
necessitates a repair to the main sewer line shall be responsible for all such
costs.
   Maintenance means keeping the sanitary sewer connection, sewer lines or
other sewer facilities or structures in satisfactory working condition and good
state of repair (including but not limited to preventing any obstruction or
extraneous materials of flows from entering the facilities, protecting the
facilities from any damage and keeping same free from defects or malfunctions),
and making necessary provisions and taking necessary precautions to assure that
the sewer facilities are at all times capable of satisfactorily performing the
services and adequately discharging the functions and producing the final
results and purposes said facilities are intended to perform, discharge or
produce.
§ 7.12 FEES FOR SANITARY SEWER CONNECTION PERMIT.
   The Building Commissioner, or in his absence, the Director of the Department
of Public Works, is hereby authorized to establish and maintain a list of fees
to be paid by any person installing a new connection or repairing a connection
to the sanitary sewer system, which fees shall be paid before any permit is
issued for a sanitary sewer system connection. The sanitary sewer connection
fee shall include charges for observation by City personnel, engineering fees,
and any other expenses incurred by the City caused by the requested connection.
§ 7.13 PUBLIC WORKS OFFICIALS.
   The Director and Assistant Director of the Public Works Department shall

prohibited from residing in a long-term care facility within the City.
   (b)   No licensee or owner of a long-term care facility may admit or allow
any person registered as a sex offender (regardless of the address where
registered) on the Sex Offender Registry maintained by the Illinois State
Police to reside in or to remain overnight in such long-term care facility.
Each long-term care facility must conduct a record search of each person to be
admitted as a resident thereof, before the person is admitted, in order to
determine whether the person is a registered sexual predator or sexual
offender. The long-term care facility must search the Sex Offender Registry
maintained by the Illinois State Police. Each long-term care facility must have
in its possession evidence demonstrating that a search of the Sex Offender
Registry has been made before allowing a person to be admitted as a resident
thereof. The long-term care facility must notify the City within 72 hours each
time that it refuses to admit a prospective resident who was identified as a
sexual predator or sexual offender on the Sex Offender Registry.
   (c)   When a long-term care facility determines upon information or belief
that a person residing therein is a sexual predator or sexual offender who is
required to be registered, but who has failed to register, under the Sex
Offender Registration Act, the long-term care facility shall notify the Hickory
Hills Police Department of its suspicion so that the Police Department can
perform a search of its data base in order to determine if that person is in
fact required to be registered under the Sex Offender Registration Act.
§ 17.06 STATE LAW.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a facility in violation

of the “Minimum Standards, Rules and Regulations for Classification and
Licensure of Long Term Care Facilities”, as promulgated by the Illinois
Department of Public Health, pursuant to the Nursing Home Care Act, 210 ILCS
45/1.
   (c)   In the event that a license issued by the State of Illinois for a
facility is revoked, suspended, or not in effect, then such fact shall be
grounds for the Mayor to take similar action with respect to any City license.
§ 17.07 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of this Chapter, any
rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, the Nursing Home Care Act, 210 ILCS
45/1 et seq., or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, shall be
subject to a fine of not less than $300.00 nor more than $1,000.00 per
violation. Each day that such violation exists shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense.
   (b)   The Mayor may also suspend, for a period not to exceed 30 days, or
seek revocation of a license issued under this Chapter, in accordance with the
procedures described in this section, upon the determination that one or more
violations of this Chapter, any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, the
Nursing Home Care Act, or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, has
occurred.
   (c)   Before any suspension or revocation order shall be issued, the Mayor
shall notify the licensee of the specific charges against him and of his right
to a hearing. Notice shall be served upon licensee of the long-term care
facility at least seven days prior to the hearing date by: (i) first class or
express mail or by overnight carrier; or (ii) personal service. The person
before whom the hearing is held shall not have been involved in the initial
decision to seek suspension. At the hearing, a long-term care facility licensee
and its representatives may be represented by counsel, present documentary
evidence and witnesses, and may cross-examine witnesses called by the charging
party. The charging party shall present sufficient evidence from witnesses
having personal knowledge of the offense to prove, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that one or more violations of the aforementioned provisions
occurred. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings shall
not apply to hearings under this section. The record of each hearing shall
include: (i) a record of the testimony presented at the hearing, which may be
by tape recording or other appropriate means; (ii) any document presented at
the hearing; and (iii) a copy of the written notice of hearing that was served
in accordance with this section. Following the hearing, the Mayor shall issue
in writing a decision stating whether the long-term care facility license shall
be suspended or revoked, or for such lesser relief as may be appropriate. The
licensee may file a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking to
review of a decision issued by the Mayor.
   (d)   Any official of the City may file charges seeking the suspension or
revocation of a license under this Chapter.

regulations of the district in which they are located.
§ 4.11.5 DRIVE-THRU FACILITIES AND WINDOWS.
   (a)   PURPOSE - The purpose of this Section is to regulate facilities
containing drive-thru windows with development standards to ensure that the
design and operation of such uses effectively mitigates associated problems
with traffic, congestion, excessive pavement, litter, and noise. Such use shall
not substantially increase traffic on streets in a residentially zoned
district; shall not create increased traffic hazards to pedestrians when
located near a school, church, auditorium, theater, or other place of assembly;
shall be located on a site having a minimum frontage of 100 feet on a major
street; and shall not substantially lessen the usability and suitability of
adjacent or nearby residentially zoned property for residential use.
   (b)   APPLICABILITY - The provisions of this Section apply to all facilities
where the drive-thru windows are constructed, added, or modified after the
passage hereof.
   (c)   DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS - The development standards in this Section are
intended to supplement the standards in the underlying zoning district for
drive-thru uses. In the event of conflict between these standards and the
underlying zoning district standards, the provisions of this Section shall
apply.
   (d)   DRIVE-THRU AISLES - The minimum standards for drive-thru aisles are:
      1.   Drive-thru aisles shall not be located in any required rear yard
setback or side yard setback where the adjoining property use is for a single-
family dwelling. Drive-thru aisles or stacking lanes shall be independent of
any on-site parking spaces, parking aisles, public streets, and public alleys.
      2.   Drive-thru aisles shall have a minimum 10-foot interior radius at
curves and a minimum 12-foot width.
      3.   Drive-thru windows and remote tellers shall provide at least 120
feet of stacking space for each facility, as measured from the service window
or unit to the entry point into the drive-thru lane. Non-food and non-beverage
businesses may reduce the stacking space to a minimum of 60 feet.
      4.   Each drive-thru entrance/exit shall be at least 50 feet from an
intersection of public streets/alleys at the closest intersecting curbs, and at
least 25 feet from the curb cut on an adjacent property.
      5.   Each entrance to a drive-thru or parking aisle and the direction of
traffic flow shall be clearly designated by signs and pavement markings.
      6.   Each drive-thru aisle shall be separated from the circulation routes
and parking aisles necessary for ingress or egress from the property, or access
to a parking space.
   (e)   HOURS OF OPERATION - When located on a site within 100 feet of any
residentially zoned property, hours of operation for a drive-thru window shall
be limited to 7:00 a.m. through 10:00 p.m. daily. For drive-thru windows
otherwise located, there are no restriction on the hours of operation.
   (f)   NOISE - Any drive-thru speaker system shall emit no more than 50
decibels and at no time shall any such speaker system be audible above daytime
ambient noise levels beyond the property lines of the site. The system shall be
designed to compensate for ambient noise levels in the immediate area.
   (g)   LIGHTING - Any lighting shall be located at a maximum height of 14
feet and shall be so arranged and shielded that there will be no glare or

the City of Hickory Hills.
§ 4.15 FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   See Ordinance No. 89-20, as amended.
§ 4.16 NOISE BUFFER ZONE.
   In order to protect the residents of the City of Hickory Hills from the
nuisance and hazards resulting from excessive noise generated by high speed
traffic, residential and institutional structures shall be discouraged within
500 feet of the center line of the Tri-State Tollway.
§ 4.17 SPECIAL USES.
   (a)   PURPOSE - The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based
upon the division of the City into districts, within which districts the use of
land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in
relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot
be properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land
and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such
special uses fall into two categories.
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      2.   Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
   (b)   INITIATION OF SPECIAL USE - Any person owning or having an interest in
the subject property may file an application to use such land for one or more
of the special uses provided for in this ordinance in the zoning district in
which the land is situated.
   (c)   APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USE - An application for a special use or
expansion of a special use shall be filed with the City Clerk. The application
shall be accompanied by such plans and/or date and a statement in writing by
the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed special use will
conform to the standards set forth in Sections
4.17(e).
   (d)   HEARING ON APPLICATION - Upon receipt in proper form of the
application and statement referred to in Sec.
4.17(c) the City Council shall refer the application to the Zoning Board of
Appeals who shall hold a public hearing under provision of Article VII of this
ordinance.
   (e)   STANDARDS - No special use shall be recommended by the Zoning Board of
Appeals unless said Board shall find:
      1.   That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort,
or general welfare.
      2.   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood.
      3.   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
      4.   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and/or other
necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
      5.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
      6.   That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the City Council pursuant to
the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (f)   CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES - Prior to the granting of any special use,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the City Council stipulate such
conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction,
maintenance, and operation of the special use as deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards
and requirements specified in Sec.
4.17(e). In all cases in which special uses are granted, the City Council shall
require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied
with.
   (g)   REVOCATION - In any case when a special use has not been established
within a year after date of granting thereof, then without further action by
the Board, the special use authorization shall be null and void.
   (h)   EFFECT OF DENIAL OF SPECIAL USE - No application for a special use
which has been wholly or in part denied shall be resubmitted for a period of
one year from the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new
evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the Board.
   (i)   EXISTING SPECIAL USES
      1.   Where a use is classified as a special use and exists as a special
use or permitted use prior to the adoption of this comprehensive revised
ordinance, then it shall be a legal special use under this ordinance.
      2.   Where a use is not allowed as a special or permitted use and exists
as a special use prior to this ordinance, then it shall become a non-conforming
use and subject to the applicable non-conforming use provisions of this
ordinance.
   (j)   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT - Planned Unit Developments are of such
substantially different character from other special uses that specific
additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the
recommendations of Zoning Board of Appeals and the action of the Board of
Commissioners.
      1.   Statement of Objectives - The intent is to permit greater
flexibility for the purpose of securing better site planning than would be
possible through a strict application of the zoning ordinance and the
subdivision regulations ordinance, while safeguarding the present or future use
and development of surrounding areas, and specifically to provide for:
         A.   An opportunity for new and creative approaches to the living
environment and for ingenuity, imagination and design efforts on the part of
builders, architects, site planners and developers;
         B.   An economic and efficient use of land;
         C.   Permanent provision of common open space and recreation area and
facilities;
         D.   The preservation of natural features, thus enhancing the
appearance of the neighborhood and serving a conservational purpose;
         E.   An improved level of amenities;
         F.   Maximum choice in the types of environment and housing available.
      2.   Review Procedure - The Plan Commission of the City of Hickory Hills
is hereby designated by the corporate authorities to review Planned Unit
Developments as a special use in accordance with 24 ILCS 11-13-1.1.
      3.   Application of Residential Planned Unit Development - The site of
the Residential Planned Unit Development shall consist of not less than two (2)
contiguous acres with no major internal barriers. This requirement may be
waived if none or more of the following conditions exist:
         A.   If, because of unusual physical features of the site itself or of
the neighborhood in which it is located, a waiver is necessary or appropriate
in order to conserve a physical or topographical feature of importance to the
municipality;
         B.   The site or its neighborhood has a historical character of
importance to the community which will be protected by a Planned Unit
Development.
      4.   Permitted Uses - A Planned Unit Development may be built in the R-3,
R-4, R-5 or C-2 Districts and may include but shall not be limited to the
following uses:
         A.   Dwelling units in detached, semi-detached, attached, multi-
storied structures or any combination thereof.
         B.   Non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, recreational and
commercial character which are primarily for the service and convenience of the
residents of the development provided that commercial development does not
exceed thirty (30) square feet of gross floor area under roof per dwelling unit
in the development. Commercial uses shall be limited to those permitted in the
C-1 and C-2 zoning districts as listed in Article VI of the Zoning Ordinance.
If land zoned commercial is included in the Planned Unit Development, the
restrictions of the commercial zone shall apply. However, the location of the
commercial development may be shifted within the project site if approved in
the development plan and provided that the size remains unchanged.
      5.   Standards - A plan for a Residential Planned Unit Development shall
be reviewed by the Plan Commission for conformity with the intent and the
spirit of the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Hickory Hills; with Statement
of Objectives for Residential Planned Unit Development of this section and for
conformity with the provisions of other sections of this ordinance and the
subdivision ordinance not superseded by the standards set out in this section.
A plan meeting those initial requirements shall qualify for tentative approval.
The Plan Commission shall not revise or add to the rules and regulations
applicable to a specific Proposed Residential Planned Unit Development after an
application has been filed by the Landowner. A plan shall be consistent with
the following general standards:
         A.   Ownership - The site of a Residential Planned Unit Development
shall be under single ownership or control at the time of approval of the final
development plan. A binding purchase agreement for the entire site at the time
of submittal of the final development plan shall satisfy the requirements of
this section.
         B.   Housing Types - The plan may include a variety of housing types.
         C.   Maximum ground coverage - The total ground area occupied by
buildings and structures shall be regulated by the rules and practice of the
Plan Commission who will evaluate the overall plan of each application
submitted under the provision of this ordinance.
         D.   Architectural Style - The architectural style of a proposed
building shall not alone be sufficient cause for denial of approval.
         E.   Density - Any plan which does not propose to increase the number
of dwelling units per acre allowed under existing provisions of this ordinance
shall qualify for approval with respect to density of use. For the purpose of
this paragraph, density shall be computed by dividing the gross project area by
the required lot area per dwelling unit after the amount required for streets
is first deducted. If the land is not entirely within a single zone, the number
of units permitted must be calculated separately for each zone and totaled to
determine the total number of dwelling units allowable in the Planned Unit
Development. If development is to take place in stages, the Plan Commission may
require that the lower density stages be developed first.
         F.   Lot and Yard Requirements - The Plan Commission may modify
requirements for yard, setback, lot size, frontage and space between buildings
for development within the Planned Unit Development, provided that the spirit
and intent of the Planned Unit Development Statement of Objectives are complied
with and that reasonable visual and acoustical privacy is provided for. The
Plan Commission may determine that certain setbacks, frontage requirements, and
types of dwellings be required within all or a portion of the perimeter of the
site in order to provide reasonable conformance with adjacent development. The
Plan Commission may require that structures located on the perimeter of the
Planned Unit Development be well screened in a manner that is approved by the
Commission in order to provide reasonable privacy for adjacent uses.
         G.   Common Open Space - The Plan Commission shall consider the
amount, shape and location of open space and proposed improvements in terms of
usability, access, and the topography of the site. Open space with natural
features worthy of preservation may be left unimproved. Common open space shall
be provided in an amount equal to the amount saved by decreased lot size
immediately adjacent to the lot so decreased.
         H.   Ownership and Maintenance of Open Space -
         (1)   All land shown on the final development plan as common space
must be conveyed under one of the following options.
            a.   It may be conveyed to a public agency which will agree to
maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures, or improvements
which have been place on it.
            b.   It may be conveyed in accordance with provisions of the final
development plan. The means of ownership and maintenance of the common open
space must be approved by the Plan Commission and must restrict the common open
space to the uses specified on the final development plan and provide for
maintenance in a manner which assures its continuing use for its intended
purpose.
         (2)   If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, one
of the following methods of enforcement must be provided.
            a.   The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses
not specified in the final development plan must be conveyed to a public
agency.
            b.   In the event of a substantial default in the stated conditions
of the restrictions governing the use, improvement, and maintenance of the
common open space, the fee title to the common open space shall be vested in a
public agency.
         (3)   No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the
final development plan unless the final development plan has been amended to
permit the use in accordance with Sub-section (j)6, Procedure. However, no
change of use authorized under Sub-section (j)6 may be considered as a waiver
of any of the covenants limiting the use of common open space areas, and all
rights to enforce these covenants against any use permitted under Sub-section
(j)6, are expressly reserved.
         I.   Minimum Area of Open Space - A minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of planned development group site area shall be developed as public
open space, including walkways, plazas, landscaped areas, pools and fountains.
Parking areas and vehicle access facilities shall not be considered in
calculating public open space.
         J.   Parking and Loading Design Standards -
         (1)   Off-street parking may be located anywhere within the Planned
Unit Development, provided that in each case the Plan Commission shall find
that such off-street parking spaces will be conveniently located. No less than
two (2) parking spaces shall be provided per single family dwelling unit, and
per multi-family unit.
         (2)   Parking facilities shall be landscaped and screened from public
view to the extent necessary to eliminate unsightliness and monotony of parked
cars.

existing and proposed buildings and appropriately landscaped.
         (4)   There shall be an adequate amount, in a suitable location, of
pedestrian walks, malls and landscaped spaces to prevent pedestrian use of
vehicular ways and parking spaces and to separate pedestrian walks, malls and
public transportation loading places from general vehicular circulation
facilities.
         (5)   Buildings and vehicular circulation open spaces shall be
arranged so that pedestrians moving between buildings are not unnecessarily
exposed to vehicular traffic.
         (6)   Landscaped, paved and comfortably graded pedestrian walks shall
be provided along the lines of the most intense use, particularly from building
entrances to streets, parking areas and adjacent buildings.
         (7)   The location and design of pedestrian walks should emphasize
desirable views of new and existing development in the area.
         (8)   The maximum separation of private automobiles and service
vehicles shall be provided through the use of separate service lanes.

of the development and have convenient access to and from adjacent uses and
blocks.
         (2)   Individual buildings shall be related to each other in design,
masses, materials, placement and connections to provide a visually and
physically integrated development.
         (3)   Treatment of the sides and rear of all buildings within the
Planned Development group shall be comparable in amenity and appearance to the
treatment given to street frontages of these same buildings.
         (4)   The design of buildings and the parking facilities shall take
advantage of the topography of the project site where appropriate, to provide
separate levels of access.
         (5)   All building walls shall be so oriented as to insure adequate
light and air exposures to the rooms within.
         (6)   All buildings shall be arranged so as to avoid undue exposure to
concentrated loading or parking facilities wherever possible and shall be so

surfaces to provide an attractive development pattern. Landscape materials
selected should be appropriate to the growing conditions of the City’s
environment.
         (3)   Whenever appropriate, existing trees shall be conserved and
integrated into the landscape design plan.
         (4)   All streets bordering the project area shall be planted at
appropriate intervals with street trees.
         N.   Subdivision Requirements -

Development meets the provisions of Section
4.17(j)(5)(E) and (G) of this ordinance, governing density, and common open
space. All sections of a subdivided or resubdivided Planned Development are to
be controlled by the final development plan rather than by the provisions of
the zoning ordinance that would otherwise be applicable. The provisions of

4.17(h), governing changes in the final development plan will apply. The owners
of a resubdivided Planned Development may jointly make application for a
conditional use or for an amendment to the final development plan.

§ 5.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this article to provide for the regulation of
non-conforming buildings, structures and uses and specify those circumstances
and conditions under which those non-conforming buildings, structures and uses
which adversely affect the maintenance, development or use and taxable value of
other property in the district in which they are located shall be permitted to
continue.
   (b)   This ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an
appropriate area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that
district. It is necessary and consistent with the establishment of those
districts that those non-conforming buildings, structures and uses which
substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and taxable value of
other property in the district not be permitted to continue without
restriction.
§ 5.02 CONTINUANCE OF USE.
   (a)   Any lawfully established use of a building or land, on the effective

use regulations for the district in which it is located, shall be deemed to be
a legal non-conforming use, and may be continued except as otherwise provided
herein.
   (b)   Any legal, non-conforming building or structure may be continued in
use, provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and
repair, except as otherwise permitted herein.
   (c)   Any building for which a permit has been lawfully granted prior to the
effective date of the ordinance or of amendments thereto, may be completed in
accordance with the approved plans; provided construction is started within
ninety (90) days and diligently prosecuted to completion. Such building shall
thereafter be deemed a lawfully established building.
§ 5.03 DISCONTINUANCE OF USE.
   (a)   Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a non-
conforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming to the provisions
of this ordinance, such premises shall not thereafter be used or occupied by a
non-conforming use, even though the building may have been originally designed
and constructed for the prior non-conforming use.
   (b)   Whenever a non-conforming use of a building or structure or part
thereof has been discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months or
whenever there is evident a clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a
non-conforming use, such use shall not after being discontinued or abandoned be
reestablished, and the use of the premises thereafter shall be in conformity
with the regulations of the District.
   (c)   Where no enclosed building is involved, discontinuance of a non-
conforming use for a period of six (6) months constitutes abandonment and shall
not thereafter be used in a non-conforming manner.
   (d)   A non-conforming use not authorized by the provisions of the zoning
ordinance in effect at the time the amendatory ordinance becomes effective,
shall be discontinued and not reestablished, except when the provisions of the
amendatory ordinance find the use to be conforming to the district in which it
is then located.
§ 5.04 CHANGE OF NON-CONFORMING USE.
   The non-conforming use of any building, structure or portion thereof, which
is designed or intended for use not permitted in the district in which it is
located, may be changed to another non-conforming use thereof only if such
other use is permitted by a Special Use Permit as authorized in the
Administrative Section.
§ 5.05 TERMINATION AND REMOVAL OF NON-CONFORMING USE, BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   The period of time during which the following non-conforming use of
buildings, structures or land may continue or remain, shall be limited from the
effective date of this ordinance or amendment hereto which causes the use to be
non-conforming. Every such non-conforming use shall be completely removed from
the premises at the expiration of the period of time specified below:

valuation not in excess of $500 on the effective date of this ordinance shall
be removed after two (2) years.

involved or where the only buildings employed are accessory or incidental to
such use, or where such use is maintained in connection with a conforming
building shall be removed after a period of two (2) years.
      3.   A non-conforming use of land (outside of a building) shall be made
to conform to the provisions of this ordinance within a period of five (5)
years.
      4.   All non-conforming signs, billboards, and outdoor advertising
structures shall be removed after a period of two years.
§ 5.06 REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS.

   (b)   No structural alteration shall be made in a building or other
structure containing a non-conforming use, except in the following situations:
      1.   When the alteration is required by law.
      2.   When the alteration will actually result in eliminating the non-
conforming use.
      3.   When a building in a residential district containing residential
non-conforming uses may be altered in any way to improve livability provided no
structural alterations shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
§ 5.07 DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION.
   If a building or other structure containing a non-conforming use is damaged
or destroyed by any means (fire, explosion, act of God, or by a public enemy)
to the extent of sixty (60) percent or more of its valuation (at that time),
the building or other structure can be rebuilt or used thereafter only for a
conforming use and in compliance with the provisions of the district in which
it is located. In the event the damage or destruction is forty (40) percent or
less, the building or structure may be then restored to its original condition
and the occupancy or use of such building may be continued which existed at the
time of such partial destruction.
   In either event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure
must be started within a period of six (6) months from the date of damage or
destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion.
§ 5.08 ADDITIONS AND ENLARGEMENTS.

entire building is thereafter devoted to a conforming use, and is made to
conform to all regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   No building partially occupied by a non-conforming use shall be
altered in such a way as to permit the enlargement or expansion of the space
occupied by such non-conforming use.
   (c)   No non-conforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a way as to
occupy any required usable open space or any land beyond the boundaries of the
lot, as it existed on the effective date of this ordinance or to displace any
conforming use in the same building or on the same parcel.
   (d)   A building or structure which is non-conforming with respect to yards
or any other element of bulk regulated herein shall not be altered if expanded
in any manner which would increase the degree or extent of its non-conforming
with respect to the bulk regulations of the district in which it is located.
§ 5.09 USE DISTRICT CHANGES.
   Whenever the boundaries of a use district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one use district to another use district of a different

§ 6.043 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Permitted and special exception uses enumerated in the I-1 Industrial
District, and uses accessory thereto, are subject to the following performance
standards.
      1.   SOUND - Sound levels shall be measured with a sound level meter and
associated octave band filter manufactured according to standards prescribed by
the American Standards Association. Measurements shall be made using the flat
network of the sound level meter. Impulsive type noises shall be subject to the
performance standards hereinafter prescribed, provided that such noises shall
be capable of being accurately measured with such equipment. Noises capable of
being so measured, for the purpose of this comprehensive amendment, shall be
those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level
meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two (2) decibels. Noises
incapable of being so measured, such as those of an irregular and intermittent
nature, shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to adjacent uses.
      In the I-1 District, at no point in the boundary of a Residential or
Commercial District shall be sound pressure level of any operation or plant
(other than background noises produced by sources not under control of this
Ordinance, such as the operation of motor vehicles or other transportation
facilities) exceed the decibel limits in the octave bands designated below:

      2.   VIBRATION - In the I-1 District, any industrial operation or
activity which shall cause at any time and at any point along the nearest
adjacent lot line, earth-borne vibrations, (other than background vibrations
produced by some source not under control of this ordinance, such as the
operation of motor vehicles or other transportation facilities) in excess of
the limits set forth in Column I is prohibited. In addition, any industrial
operation or activity which shall cause at any time and at any point along a
Residential District boundary line, earth borne vibrations in excess of the
limits set forth in Column II is prohibited. Vibrations shall be expressed as
displacement in inches and shall be measured with a three-component measuring
system approved by the Zoning Board.

Steady-State-Vibrations, for the purpose of this Ordinance are
vibrations which are continuous, or if in discrete pulses are more
frequent than 100 per minute. Impact vibrations, that is, discrete
pulses which do not exceed 100 impulses per minute shall not cause in
excess of twice the displacements stipulated.
*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
 
      3.   SMOKE AND PARTICULATE MATTER - In the I-1 District, the emission of
more than twenty (20) smoke units per hour per stack is prohibited, including
smoke of a density in excess of Ringelmann No. 2. However, once during any six-
hour period each stack may emit up to thirty-five (35) smoke units - not to
exceed Ringelmann No. 2 - when blowing soot or cleaning fires. Only during
fire-cleaning periods, however, shall smoke of Ringelmann No. 3 be permitted,
and then for not more than four (4) minutes per period.
      The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of one pound per acre of
lot area during any one hour, after deducting from the gross hourly emission
per acre the correction factor set forth in the following table.
Allowance for Height of Emission*
Height of Emission Above Grade (feet) Correction Pounds per hour per Acre
Allowance for Height of Emission*
Height of Emission Above Grade (feet) Correction Pounds per hour per Acre

400                                   0.50
*Interpolate for intermediate values not shown in table.
 
   Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within
the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
         A.   Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each
source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area,
thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre.
         B.   From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in A. above,
deduct the correction factor (interpolating as required) for height of emission
set forth in the table, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in pounds
per acre per hour from each source of emission.
         C.   Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in B.
above, to obtain the total net rate of emission from all sources of emission
within the boundaries of the lot. Such total shall not exceed one pound per
acre of lot area during any one hour.
      4.   TOXIC MATTER - In the I-1 District, no activity or operation shall
cause, at any time, the discharge of toxic matter across lot lines in such
concentrations as to be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
comfort, or welfare, or cause injury or damage to property or business.
      5.   NOXIOUS AND ODOROUS MATTER - In the I-1 Districts, no activity or
operation shall cause at any time, the discharge of matter across lot lines in
such concentrations as to be noxious. The emission of matter in such quantities
as to be readily detectable as an odor at any point along lot lines is
prohibited.
      6.   FIRE AND EXPLOSIVE HAZARDS - In the I-1 District, the storage,
utilization or manufacture of solid materials or products ranging from
incombustible to moderate burning is permitted.
      The storage, utilization, or manufacture of solid materials or products
ranging from free or active burning to intense burning is permitted provided
the following condition is met:
      Said material or products shall be stored, utilized, or manufactured
within completely enclosed buildings having incombustible exterior walls and
protected throughout by an automatic fire extinguishing system.
      The storage, utilization, or manufacture of flammable liquids, or
materials which produce flammable or explosive vapors or gases, shall be
permitted in accordance with the following table - exclusive of storage of
finished products in original sealed containers, which shall be unrestricted:

difficulties or particular hardship, shall also take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant, have been
established by the evidence that:
      1.   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship
upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter
of the regulations were to be carried out.
      2.   The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would
not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification.
      3.   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
      4.   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having an interest in the property.
      5.   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
      6.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire, or
otherwise endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair
property values within the neighborhood.
   (e)   The Board may require or recommend such conditions and restrictions
upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with
the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious
effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to
implement the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance.

for further consideration.
   (g)   Any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval of the

   (a)   Every proposed subdivision shall make provision for surface drainage
and flooding. The provisions shall be based upon a study prepared by the
subdivider’s engineer of the entire area tributary to streams, channels, or
drainage ways in the subdivision. This study, upon which design of the storm
sewer and drainage system will be based, shall consist of at least the
following:
      1.   Analysis of area tributary to subdivision, including area,
topography, drainage, rainfall intensity and frequency, run-off, and flooding;
      2.   A topographic map of the subdivision, indicating any areas subject
to flooding and showing the surface run-off which will occur in the subdivision
after extreme rainstorms;
      3.   A report of the basis of the design of the proposed sewers, open
channels, and detention basins proposed for the subdivision.
   (b)   The proposed drainage system and outlet of the subdivision shall be
designed so that it will not fail to function when the receiving stream or
channel is in full flood. Streets shall be designed where possible to act as
open channels, with positive drainage toward the major watercourse or channel
in the area.
   (c)   Each river or stream which borders or traverses the proposed
subdivision shall be provided with a storm water easement or right-of-way
conforming substantially with the lines of the watercourse and of such further
width as will be adequate to accommodate observed, computed, or anticipated
flood flows and heights and will provide access along the channel for operation
of channel operation and maintenance equipment.
   (d)   Each minor drainageway, channel, or watercourse which borders or
traverses the proposed subdivision shall be maintained as open channels with a
storm water easement or right-of-way of adequate width to accommodate observed,
computed, or anticipated run-off and flood flows. Upon indication of adequacy
of design, as evidenced by the studies of subsection (a) the upper reaches of
such drainageways may be enclosed as a part of a storm sewer system.
   (e)   Where a surface drainage easement or public utility easement is
platted for a rear yard or side yard, such easement shall be centered on the
lot lines and shall be a minimum of 5 feet in width on each lot. With the
exception of fences and public utility poles, no structures, accessory
structures, garages, landscaping berm or sheds shall be constructed thereon
without the approval of the City. No structures will be allowed if the flow of
water is impeded.
   (f)   The elevation of the finished surface of any street proposed in an
area of a subdivision subject to flooding shall be not less than one foot above
the observed, computed, or anticipated flood level.
   (g)   When a subdivision drainage plan proposes use of retention basins or
ponds, which are to be dedicated for public use, provision shall be made that a
public access be possible through extension of a street stub to connect the
facility to a public street.
(Ord. 21-4, passed 6-10-2021)
§ 23.09 RECREATION AREAS, OPEN SPACES, AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   (a)   Where a proposed park, playground or open space shown on the General
Plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the Commission shall
require that such area or areas be shown on the Plat in accordance with the
requirements specified in subsection (b) below. Such area or areas may be
dedicated to the city by the subdivider if the City Council approves such
dedication.
   (b)   The Plan Commission shall require that the Plat show sites of a
character, extent, and location suitable for the development of a park,
playground, or other recreation purpose. The Plan Commission may require that
the developer satisfactorily grade any such recreation areas shown on the Plat.
   The Plan Commission shall require that not less than 3 acres of recreation
space be provided per 100 dwelling units shown on the Plat. However, in no case
shall the amount be more than 10 percent of the total area of the subdivision.
Such area or areas may be dedicated to the city by the subdivider if the City
Council approves such dedication.
   (c)   In the event that an area to be used for a park or playground is
required to be so shown, the subdivider shall submit, prior to final approval,
to the Plan Commission 3 prints (one on cloth) drawn in ink showing, at a scale
of not less than 30 feet to the inch, such area and the following features
thereof:
      1.   The boundaries of the said area, giving lengths and bearings of all
straight lines; radii, lengths, central angles and tangent distances of all
curves.
      2.   Existing features such as streams, ponds, clusters of trees, and
structures.
      3.   Existing and, if applicable, proposed changes in grade and contours
of the said area and of area immediately adjacent.
   (d)   Reserve strips of land which might be used to control access from the
proposed subdivision to any neighboring property or to any land within the
subdivision itself shall be prohibited.
   (e)   The Plan Commission shall, wherever possible, establish the
preservation of all natural features which add value to residential
developments and to the community, such as large trees or groves, watercourses
and falls, beaches, historic spots, vistas and similar irreplaceable assets. No
trees with a diameter of 8 inches or more as measured 3 feet above the base of
the trunk shall be removed unless such tree is within the right-of-way of a
street as shown on the final Subdivision Plat. Removal of additional trees
shall be subject to the approval of the Plan Commission. In no case, however,
shall a tree with a diameter of 8 inches or more as measured 3 feet above the
base of the trunk be removed without prior approval by the Plan Commission.
§ 23.10 IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Plans, profiles, and specifications for all required improvements
shall be in accordance with the standards and specifications herein in this
section set forth. No improvements shall be made, installed or constructed
unless and until all such plans, profiles and specifications shall have been
submitted to and approved by the city engineer, and such county, state and
other public officials as may be concerned or have jurisdiction therein. All
construction shall comply with design specifications approved by the Illinois
Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago.
   (b)   The following improvements shall be required:
      1.   Storm Drainage. A system of storm water drainage shall be
constructed and installed, consisting of pipes, tiles, manholes, inlets and
other necessary facilities which will drain the subdivision and protect roadway
pavements. In all drainage improvements provision must be made for carrying off
storm water which will eventually find its natural way to or through the area
being developed. Such provision shall be designed to take water at the
anticipated rate of run-off which will result when a population density of
approximately 13 persons per gross acre shall reside upstream. Such facilities
shall remove storm water to flood areas adjacent to the subdivision. The design
capacity shall be such that the drainage system will provide for the removal of
storm water resulting from rainfall with an intensity rate of 2 inches per
hour. All storm sewers shall be shown in plan and profile on both preliminary
and final plans.
      If as the result of special studies, the city shall find that certain
areas may require additional consideration because of the inherently poor
conditions of drainage, the following shall apply to those areas. Special curbs
and gutters may be required in order to store portions of the storm water for
short periods; certain minimum house elevations and street grades may be
specified where studies indicate that removal of water may not be accomplished
for prolonged periods; reservation of certain areas may be required for
impoundments of run-off in excess of what the natural channels area capable of
removing; storm water either in conduits or in ditches.
      In the event that any of the conditions above may apply, and that special
structures may be required, it shall be the burden of the builder to construct
these insofar as they benefit his development, and to make adequate provisions
for future construction by others where such provision is called for.
      2.   Sewage Disposal. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a
complete sanitary sewer system which shall connect all lots and tracts within
the subdivision with the public sanitary sewer system.
      3.   Water Supply. The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a
complete water main supply system which shall be connected to the public water
supply system. Fire hydrants shall be installed throughout the entire
subdivision when served by a public water supply system. Water mains should be
not less than 6 inches in diameter, and shall include installation of shut-off
valves and fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed at intervals of not
to exceed 300 feet.
      4.   House Services. House services shall be constructed to connection
with the utility service mains constructed within any street to serve each
adjoining lot, tract or building site; such house services shall extend from
the main to a point of at least 8 feet beyond the outside curb lines of the
proposed roadway pavement in the street. Plans shall indicate the location of
all such house services connected with utility mains constructed within any
street or thoroughfare. The minimum size of sanitary house service pipes shall
be 6 inches internal diameter.
      5.   Streets. All streets within the subdivision shall be graded and
improved with a durable hard surface roadway. Before the base course of the
roadway pavement is laid, all of the underground work, such as sewer, water and
gas mains, house service connections therewith, and any underground conduits
for electric and telephone lines, shall be complete and installed in place and
approved.
      6.   Curbs and Gutters. The dimensions and materials of curb and gutter
shall conform to the specifications of the city engineer.
      7.   Sidewalks and Crosswalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed in the
street right-of-way and not more than one foot from the abutting property line.
      8.   Street Trees. One hardwood tree having a diameter of not less than 2
inches shall be planted at a location approved by the Building Commissioner in
the parkway in front of each lot, except that a lot with frontage in excess of
74 feet shall require two hardwood trees.
      9.   Street Lighting. Street lighting shall be provided by the
subdivision throughout the subdivision at all street intersections and at
intervals of not more than 300 feet between intersections. Specific street
light locations shall be approved by the city engineer.
      10.   Street Signs. An appropriate street sign shall be erected at each
street intersection within the subdivision. The type of sign and the location
thereof shall be subject to the approval and direction of the Director of
Public Works.
   (c)   All utility distribution lines for telephone and electric service to
be installed shall be placed underground within easements or dedicated public
ways. The installation of such facilities shall be made in compliance with
applicable orders, rules and regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission
now or hereafter effective, and the owner or subdivider of any property to be
served from such underground installations shall be responsible for compliance
with the rules and regulations, now or hereafter effective and filed with said
Commission pursuant to the Illinois Public Utilities Act, 220 ILCS 5/1-101, of
any public utility whose services will be required with respect to the
provision of such underground facilities.
   (d)   No approval of a final Plat will be made until improvements as
required by the Plan Commission are made, or until the Plan Commission has been
provided proper guarantee of performance.
   (e)   The following procedure for the required public improvements shall be
followed:
      1.   In all cases, the subdivider shall be responsible for the
installation of all required improvements under supervision of the city
engineer.
      2.   No Final Plat shall be recorded until provision has been made for
the proper installation of required improvements. The subdivider must post with
the City Clerk a cashiers check, certified check or letter of credit made out
to the city in an amount equal to 110% of the amount required to install the
required public improvements as determined by the city engineer. The form of
the letter of credit shall be approved by the city attorney and shall provide
for a one-year guarantee after acceptance of the public improvements.
      3.   The subdivider shall guarantee maintenance and repair of all public
improvements for one year after the construction thereof has been approved by
the city engineer.
§ 23.11 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   (a)   All street lot layouts shall conform to the existing layout of the
city or of adjacent areas under its jurisdiction and shall constitute
reasonable extension of these, and shall not violate any part of the Master
Plan of the city.
   (b)   It is the duty of the subdivider to furnish evidence that any proposed
subdivision is in the best interest of the public.

issued must be completed within one year of the date of the issuance of the
building permit, except where it is not feasible to construct a building within

such a case, the Building Commissioner may provide for a longer termination
date for the original building permit. However, such extended original building
permit must be granted by the Building Commissioner prior to the construction
of the building.
   (c)   lf construction of the building is not completed within one year from
the date of issuance of the building permit, no certificate of occupancy may be
issued for the building unless an additional payment equal to 100% of the

Commissioner and Aldermen shall be final subject to appeal within 5 days
thereafter to the City Council which shall render a final decision, subject to

order to protect and enhance property values. The construction of single-family
residences which are substantially similar in appearance to other nearby
single-family residences are prohibited in accordance with the provisions of
this Section.
   (b)   Similarity in Appearance Prohibited in Single-Family Residential
Construction.
      1.   No building permit shall be issued for any new dwelling unit (the
“Subject Lot”) in the R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts
which is similar in front facade appearance to any dwelling unit meeting the
following requirements:
         A.   The Subject Lot shall be dissimilar to the dwelling units on the
immediately adjacent lots on the same side of the street;
         B.   The Subject Lot shall be dissimilar to the dwelling unit directly
across the street;
         C.   With respect to lots with frontage on the bulb of a cul-de-sac,
the Subject Lot shall be dissimilar to dwelling units on the immediately
adjacent lots or directly across the cul-de-sac from the Subject Lot;
         D.   With respect to front yards, in the event the lot adjacent on
either side of the Subject Lot, the lot directly across the street from the
Subject Lot has a different yard type (i.e., side, rear) adjacent to the shared
street, then the restrictions shall not apply to those lots; and
         E.   When calculating lots for purposes of dissimilarity, an
intervening street shall be counted as the adjacent lot.
      2.   No building permit shall be issued for any new dwelling unit in the
R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 Single-Family Residential Districts which is similar in
side or rear facade appearance to the adjacent dwelling on the same side of the
street.
      3.   A single-family dwelling on a corner lot may be considered
dissimilar to another if the front of the two dwelling units face different
streets.
      4.   Single-family dwelling units must comply with the dissimilarity
provisions which are applicable to the front facade, side facades, and rear
facade.
   (c)   Standards for Determining Similarity in Appearance.
      1.   Distinguishing Characteristics, Front Facade: For the purpose of
this subsection, the term “similar in appearance” shall mean a dwelling unit
which is identical, or substantially similar, to another in any three of the
following characteristics with respect to the front facade:
         A.   Roof type (gable, hip, mansard, gambrel, flat or combination).
Mixtures of roof types and design are sufficient to render dwelling units
dissimilar.
         B.   Roof height or roof pitch shall be significantly different.
         C.   Approximate dimensions (height and length) of the front wall
closest to the front lot line.
         D.   Shape of the front elevation silhouette.
         E.   Relative locations, types and sizes of windows in the front
elevation. The addition or subtractions of muntin bars, small gable or hip
projections above windows, and window dormers are not sufficient to make
adjacent structures dissimilar.
         F.   Relative location, design and dimensions of garage door, if
included on the front elevation.
         G.   Type and color of front facade materials (e.g., brick veneer,
lapped horizontal siding, half timber, board and batten, shakes, etc.). Changes
in materials must occur throughout the front facade or elevation for a minimum
of one story in height. Color change shall be made by significant changes in
shades of color.
      2.   Distinguishing Characteristics, Side and Rear Facades on Corner
Lots, and Rear Facades Fronting a Public Right-of-Way: For the purpose of this
subsection, the term “similar in appearance” shall mean a dwelling which is
identical, or substantially similar, to another type and color of side and rear
facade (e.g., brick veneer, lapped horizontal siding, half timber, board and
batten, shakes, etc.). Changes in materials must occur throughout the entire
facade or elevation for a minimum of one story in height. Color change shall be
made by significant changes in shades of color.
      3.   Housing Styles: Housing style is in and of itself a significant
enough characteristic to constitute dissimilarity with respect to the Subject
Lot and the similarity standards delineated in subsection (A) and (B) do not
apply. Housing styles shall consist of the following: ranch, bi-level, tri-
level, one and one-half story, and two-story.
   (d)   Administration and Enforcement; Appeals.
      1.   Rules: The Building Commissioner is authorized to make rules
regarding the interpretation of the provisions of this Section.
      2.   Determination: The Building Commissioner shall make the initial
determination as to similarity in appearance and shall not issue a building
permit for any dwelling unit which violates the provisions of this Section. If
a permit is denied, written reasons shall be provided detailing why the
proposed dwelling unit is similar in appearance to another dwelling unit.
      3.   Appeal: A decision by the Building Commissioner denying a permit may
be appealed in writing to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
      4.   Waiver: The City Council reserves the right to waive the provisions
of this Section by motion approved at a Board meeting.
      5.   Applicability: The provisions of this Section apply only to the
issuance of building permits for a newly constructed dwelling unit and not to
remodeling or reconstruction.
§ 24.33 POST CONSTRUCTION STORM WATER RUNOFF.
   (a)   General Provisions.
      1.   Findings of Fact. It is hereby determined that:
         A.   Land development projects alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition;
         B.   This storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of
water-borne pollutants, and;
         C.   Storm water runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution
can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of storm water runoff
from development sites.
   Therefore, the City of Hickory Hills establishes this set of water quality
and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable
guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of
storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other
construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm
water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public
interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
      2.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish minimum storm
water management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general
health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this
jurisdiction. This Section seeks to meet that purpose through the following
objectives:
         A.   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels.
         B.   Minimize pollution caused by storm water runoff from development
that would otherwise degrade local water quality.
         C.   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
         D.   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management controls and to
ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no
threat to public safety.
      3.   Applicability. This Section shall apply to all sites, as defined
herein provided that the following may be exempted by the City:
         A.   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures.
         B.   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the City.
   Decisions on permitting shall be made by the Building Commissioner and on-
site storm water requirements shall be made by the City Engineer. This
determination shall be dependent upon the amount of impervious area created by
the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the City.
      4.   Compatibility with Other Permit and Section Requirements. This
Section is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this Section should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this Section imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other Section, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

      1.   Permit Required. No person shall conduct or permit any land
disturbance activity on any site without a storm water management permit issued
by the City.
      2.   Application Requirements. A permit application shall bear the name
and address of the owner or developer of the site, and of any consulting firm
retained by the applicant and shall be accompanied by a filing fee and a storm
water management concept plan and a maintenance agreement. The filing fee shall
be $250 per acre, or part thereof, of the site, plus any review fees incurred
by the City to independent contractors.
   (d)   Waivers to Storm water Management Requirements.
      1.   Waiver Eligibility Criteria. Every applicant shall provide for storm
water management as required by this Section, unless this requirement is waived
by the City. The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived
in whole or in part upon request of the applicant, provided that at least one
of the following conditions applies:
         A.   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this Section.
         B.   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the City and the implementation of the plan is required by
local Section.
         C.   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or
greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a
legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of
the storm water practice.
         D.   The City finds that meeting the minimum on-site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
         E.   Non-structural practices will be used on the sites that reduce:
(i) the generation of storm water from the site, (ii) the size and cost of
storm water storage and (iii) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-
structural practices are explained in detail in the Illinois Urban Manual.
      2.   Assurances Required for Waiver. In instances where one of the
conditions above applies, the City may grant a waiver from strict compliance
with these storm water management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the variance will not
result in the following impacts to downstream waterway.
         A.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures.
         B.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat.
         C.   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation.
         D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and
property.
   (e)   General Performance Criteria for Storm water Management. Unless judged
by the City to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance
criteria shall be addressed for storm water management at all sites:
      1.   All site designs shall, to the maximum extent possible, establish
storm water management practices to control the peak flow rates of storm water
discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
storm water runoff. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for
storm water treatment and to infiltrate storm water runoff from driveways,
sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent
practical.
      2.   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the Illinois Urban
Manual.
      3.   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
storm water pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The storm water pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
      4.   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the City to
determine if they are subject to additional storm water design requirements.
      5.   The calculations for determining peak flows as required by the
MWRDGC shall be used for sizing all storm water management practices where
applicable.
   (f)   Basic Storm Water Management Design Criteria.
      1.   Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture
stormwater runoff pollutants. In particular, designers shall give preference to
wet bottom and wetland designs in locations adjacent to or near existing
wetlands or in other areas where they are suitable and acceptable to the City
and all flows from the development shall be routed through the basin.
      2.   Dry basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain
developments to enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the
City. Retention and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the
property’s drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to
reduce the quantity of runoff pollutants.
      3.   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open
space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation, wetlands and water quality
mitigation. The applicant should try to avoid using portions of the property
exclusively for stormwater management.
   (g)   Post Construction Management.
      1.   The requirements of Section IV (D)(2)(b) of NPDES permit No. ILR10
including management practices, controls and other provisions at least as
protective as the requirements contained in the Illinois Urban Manual.
      2.   The long term operation and maintenance of all BMP’s shall be
provided for.

determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by the City in conducting the
audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% percent of the total amount of the

notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide
any tax still due and owing.

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
      2.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any 4-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the City,
the tax paid was less than 75% of the tax due, the statute of limitations shall
be 6 years after the end of the calendar year in which return for the
applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was filed.
      3.   No statute of limitations shall not apply if a fraudulent tax return
was filed by the taxpayer.
   (o)   Voluntary Disclosure. For any locally imposed and administered tax for
which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation,
or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file
an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of
the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to
pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month or part thereof,
for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than 4
years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid
voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax,
interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed.
However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax
due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable
interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud
on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed
invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than
90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date
agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed
as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
Section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the
exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.
   (p)   Publication of Tax Ordinances. Any locally administered tax ordinance
shall be published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting
of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements.
Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request
at the City Clerk’s office.
   (q)   Local Tax Administrator. The local tax administrator shall establish
an internal review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers
for unpaid taxes. Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the
lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is
determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall:
      (i)   timely remove the lien at the City’s expense;
      (ii)   correct the taxpayer’s credit record; and
      (iii)   correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
   (r)   Application. This Section shall be liberally construed and
administered to supplement all of the City’s tax ordinances. To the extent that
any tax ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this Section, this
Section shall be controlling.

§ 39.01 TREE PRESERVATION.
   The purpose of this section is to set standards to preserve, protect and
enhance a diminishing natural resource, the portion of the urban forest that is
located on public land and to set standards for our urban forestry during the
development, construction and redevelopment processes. The complete urban
forest is comprised of trees across all land uses and ownership on public and
private land.
   The intent of this Section is to recognize the services and function that
trees provide as a collective asset to the entire community and to state the
goals of the City with respect to the protection, preservation, care and
planting of trees on public lands and tree preservation standards for
development, construction and re-development.
   Specific goals of this section are to:
   A.   Protect, preserve and enhance the quality of life and general welfare
of the City, its residents and its property owners; and conserve and enhance
the City’s natural, physical and aesthetic environment.
   B.   Preserve, protect and enhance the urban forest to ensure that trees are
properly planted and maintained within the City so that trees can protect,
enhance and preserve the quality of life for people within the City.
   C.   Recognize that trees are an integral part of the infrastructure of the
City and as such should be preserved, protected and cared for as other critical
City infrastructure.
      (1)   Trees absorb pollution from the air;
      (2)   Trees absorb and sequester carbon dioxide;
      (3)   Trees absorb and filter pollution from stormwater run-off;
      (4)   Trees produce oxygen;
      (5)   Trees reduce flooding;
      (6)   Trees stabilize soils and reduce erosion;
      (7)   Trees cool the surrounding area helping to reduce impacts due to
heat islands;
      (8)   Trees reduce energy consumption by shielding structures from harsh
winds and sun;
      (9)   Trees provide a buffer and screen against noise, light and
pollution;
      (10)   Trees improve property values;
      (11)   Trees improve commercial district buyer traffic and purchasing;
      (12)   Areas with trees have lower crime rates;
      (13)   Areas with trees have higher levels of community interaction;
      (14)   Trees provide important habitat for birds and other wildlife; and
      (15)   Trees protect and enhance our quality of life.
      D.   Trees provide the City collective benefits that extend beyond
property boundaries throughout the entire City.
      E.   Recognize that larger trees provide larger benefits. When a large
tree is removed and replaced with a smaller tree the benefits and services are
reduced.
      F.   Recognize that some trees may have a condition that constitutes a
threat, danger or nuisance to the public or property within the City or may be
dangerous to the health of other trees and vegetation in the City.

Urban Forestry Management Plan.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.04 PLANTING.
   A.   As outlined in the Urban Forestry Management Plan, the City shall
plant, and recommend to private landowners, diverse species with the ratio of
not more than 20% of any one family, 10% of any one genus or 5% of any one
species, with the exception of naturalized areas where species selections are
based on the natural species assemblages as defined in the Urban Forestry
Management Plan. Diverse species composition protects the City from
catastrophic loss.
   B.   Acceptable and unacceptable species, along with small tree species
approved for underneath power lines, are listed in the Urban Forestry
Management Plan.
   C.   All trees planted by the City or their agent shall be planted in
accordance with the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
   D.   Trees purchased by the City shall meet the specifications required in
the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
   E.   It shall be unlawful to plant any tree or shrub in the public right-of-
way, or on other publicly owned property, without prior approval from the City.
   F.   It shall be unlawful to plant any tree under utility wires that is
anticipated to grow to a height that will interfere with the wires.
   G.   The City shall provide education and outreach to private landowners on
the need for species and age diversity, proper selection and planting
practices, and how to select species for particular sites.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.05 TREE CARE.
   A.   Tree care within the City, on public lands, shall comply with
requirements identified in the Urban Forestry Management Plan. It is
recommended that tree care on private property meet these same requirements.
   B.   Best management practices recommend trees should be pruned on a
cyclical basis as preventive maintenance. Cyclical pruning ensures dead
branches, storm damaged limbs or unsightly growth are removed before becoming
hazardous or bad for the health of the tree. Proper pruning tree care should be
completed within every 7 years for each public tree.
   C.   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or employee to perform
topping of any street tree or other tree on public property. Trees severely
damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or
other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical, may be
exempted at the determination of the City Arborist.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.06 TREE PROTECTION.
   A.   Unless otherwise authorized by this Section, it shall be unlawful for
any person to remove, injure or undertake any procedure which will cause death,
substantial damage, or create a hazard, to any public property tree without
first obtaining a Tree Permit from the City. In the case of tree management
practices, these practices shall comply with the requirements identified in the
Urban Forestry Management Plan.
   B.   Approved tree preservation plans are required prior to permits issued
for demolition and/or construction involving a principal structure. On sites
where demolition and construction projects are permitted, all trees not
approved for removal must be protected on site and in the parkway by protection
fencing prior to the start of any work or delivery of any materials to the
Building Activity Area. The approved Tree Preservation Plan shall be available
on the site throughout the entire construction period until final approvals for
all site work shall be received in writing.
   C.   In instances where the activity requires the use of heavy equipment and
where that activity may impact trees on public or private property, all
appropriate tree protection measures must be taken and identified in the Tree
Preservation Plan. In addition, all tree protection measures shall be in
compliance with the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.07 TREE REMOVAL.
   Tree removals are considered an impact to the entire City, whether on public
or private land. It is clearly documented that larger trees provide larger
benefits and as such, tree removal fines are based on diameter. It is
recognized that the planting of smaller trees does not replace the value of
larger trees that are lost. It will take tens of years for that value to be
replaced and for that reason efforts should be made to preserve and protect
trees where they are growing.
   A.   It shall be unlawful for any individual to remove or cause damage to
any tree located on public property without first receiving a Tree Permit from
the City, except provided for in this ordinance. Failure to obtain a permit as
required in this section will result in a fine of $100 per inch of the tree’s
diameter at breast height and shall be levied against that person or entity
primarily responsible for the tree removed or destroyed. This is in addition to
the required tree replacement as set forth in Section 39.08 of this Tree Care
Ordinance.
   B.   No live, dead or dying tree, or grouping of trees, equal to 6 inches or
greater on public property may be removed without first obtaining a permit from
the City.
   C.   A nuisance tree is a tree that has already died, is in a state of
irrevocable decline, has the capacity to damage a person or thing or is an
invasive species. In the event of an emergency, and access to the City is not
possible, a nuisance tree may be removed without a permit, however, the
individual removing the tree shall take photographs and memorialize the
nuisance situation prior to removal and shall follow up with a request for a
tree permit from the City on the next business day.
   D.   Any tree, taller than 20 feet or larger than 6 inches in diameter,
measured 12 inches above the ground, removed from a parcel or transplanted
offsite must be replaced according to the regulations outlined in Section
39.08.C.
   E.   All stump removals shall require underground utility locations prior to
any action.
   F.   If a tree is removed or damaged which is not on the Tree Permit it must
be replaced as set forth in this Section.
   G.   Removal of invasive woody plants such as buckthorn does not require a
permit and is encouraged. These invasive plants can quickly colonize an area
reducing the health and vitality of non-invasive plants. A list of unacceptable
woody plants is provided in the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.08 TREE REPLACEMENT.
   A.   It is required that tree replacement species come from the Approved
Species List as provided in the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
   B.   Any tree which is required to be removed or which has been damaged
shall require a bond to be posted until adequate replacements or remediation
can be made. Determination of extent of damage is at the sole discretion of the
City.
   C.   Any tree species removed, 6 inch DBH or 6 inch group of trees, which is
not identified on the invasive species list, but is identified on the Preferred
Species List, is required for replacement by this Section. All replacements
shall be located appropriately as confirmed by a certified arborist and as
approved by the City.
      (1)   Commercial, multi-family and planned unit developments.
 
Diameter of Removed Tree Number of Replacement Trees
6" to 12"                2 trees at 2" or 1 tree at 4" diameter
13" to 25"               4 trees at 2" or 2 trees at 4" diameter
26" or greater           6 trees at 2" or 3 trees at 4" diameter
 
      (2)   Single Family Construction. Single family construction must be done
to avoid destruction or removal of trees taller than 20 feet or larger than 6
inches in diameter, measured 12 inches above the ground. Any such tree removed
or damaged should be replaced by a species compatible with the existing tree on
a one-for-one basis. The number of replacement trees will be limited to what
can be reasonably accommodated within the available lot area.
   D.   When a tree removal is required as a result of any project, tree
replacement shall occur within the landscape season. In the event of weather
conditions or species-specific needs, which prohibit proper replacement of a
tree, the City may issue written notice of an extension of up to 180 days upon
written request by the Applicant. If an extension is awarded to the Applicant,
the Applicant shall notify the City when replacement is complete. If, after the
30-day or awarded 180-day extension, the tree is not replaced or the Applicant
has not notified the City that installation is complete, all bonds shall be
forfeited and the bond money shall be placed in the Tree Bank.
   E.   All tree replacement plantings shall require an underground utility
location prior to planting.
   F.   If the property where a removal has taken place does not have adequate
space to plant a replacement tree, then the Applicant shall be required to pay
the City a dollar amount of $100 per inch of the tree’s diameter at breast
height per tree. Funds shall be placed in the Tree Bank for tree replacement or
tree care in the City.
   G.   It shall be encouraged that any species identified on the invasive
species list be removed. There is no replacement requirement for these
removals.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.09 TREE PRESERVATION AND REMOVAL PLAN FOR SIGNIFICANT REMOVALS,
CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT.
   An applicant seeking a permit for significant tree removals or tree removal
and/or planting related to construction and/or development of the principal
structure shall comply with all requirements of this Section and the Urban
Forestry Management Plan.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)

      (5)   Any tree, shrub or other plant or portion thereof whether located
on City-owned property or on private property which dangerously obstructs the
view in the “visibility triangle” as such may be established by the City
Arborist or Director of Public Works.
   B.   No person shall unreasonably hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with
the City Arborist, the Director of Public Works or his agents. The officers,
agents, servants and employees of the City have the authority to enter onto
private property whereon there is located a tree, shrub, plant or plant part
that is suspected to be a public nuisance.
   C.   The following are the prescribed means of abating public nuisances:
      (1)   Any public nuisance which is located on City-owned property shall
be pruned, removed, or otherwise treated by the City Arborist or the Director
of Public Works in whatever fashion is required to cause the abatement of the
nuisance within a reasonable time after its discovery.
      (2)   Any public nuisance which is located on private-owned property
shall be pruned, removed, or otherwise treated by the property owner or his/her
agent in whatever fashion is required to cause the abatement of the nuisance.
No property owner may be found guilty of violating this provision unless and
until the following requirements of notice have been satisfied:
         a.   The Director of Public Works shall cause a written notice to be
personally served or sent by first class mail to the person to whom was sent
the tax bill for the general taxes for the last preceding year.
         b.   Such notice shall describe the kind of tree, shrub or other plant
or plant part which has been declared to be a public nuisance; its location on
the property; the reason for declaring it a nuisance.
         c.   Such notice shall describe the premises by legal description,
permanent index number, or by address.
         d.   Such notice shall state the actions that the property owner may
undertake to abate the nuisance.

         f.   Such notice may include a copy of this ordinance and a copy of 65
ILCS 5/11-20-11 and 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12.
         In the event that the nuisance is not abated by the date specified in
the notice, the Director of Public Works is authorized to cause the abatement
of said nuisance. The reasonable cost of such abatement shall be filed as a
lien against the property on which the nuisance was located. In addition, the
property owner of the property upon which the nuisance is located shall be
subject to prosecution under this Tree Care Ordinance. Nothing in this
provision shall be construed to exempt any person from the requirements of
obtaining permits under this Tree Care Ordinance.
      (3)   The Director of Public Works is empowered to cause the immediate
abatement of any public nuisance provided that the nuisance is determined by
the City Arborist or Director of Public Works to be an immediate threat to any
person, or property.
      (4)   The Director of Public Works is hereby empowered to seek from any
court of competent jurisdiction an order directing immediate abatement of any
public nuisance.
(Ord. 22-09, passed 6-9-2022)
§ 39.11 INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL.
   A.   Invasive Woody Plants. Invasive plants cause ecological disruption to
natural ecosystems. The type of impact varies based on the species and the
traits of that species. The Woody Invasive Species List is included in the
Urban Forestry Management Plan. These species shall not be planted and should
be removed and controlled to reduce impacts to other vegetation.
      (1)   Typical impacts include:
         a.   Chemical disturbance to the soil limiting development of other
species;
         b.   Dense plant growth limiting light to soil surface resulting in
exposed soil allowing erosion;
         c.   Displacement of naturally occurring species resulting in a
monoculture of invasive species and aggressive tendencies.
      (2)   The City shall have implementation and outreach plan to educate
property owners of the potential impacts and remediation strategies, including
a suggested planting list of alternative species to assist property owners in
dealing with the problem. This plan is located in the Urban Forestry Management
Plan.
   B.   Invasive Disease and Insects.
      (1)   Impacts to Trees. Invasive diseases and insects can create
significant stress to trees and in some instances kill trees. The City has
developed a list of Invasive Diseases and Insects that pose significant threats
to trees from information identified by State and Federal Departments of
Agriculture. This list is included in the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
      (2)   Private Property Owner Outreach. The City shall have an
implementation and outreach plan to educate property owners of the potential
impacts and remediation strategies to help property tree owners in dealing with
pests or pathogens. This plan is located in the Urban Forestry Management Plan.

§ 41.31 AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.
   As used in this section, words or terms shall have the following meaning
unless the context or usage clearly indicates another meaning was intended:
   Administrator means the Traffic Compliance Administrator appointed as such
through Section 41.24 of the Municipal Code of the City of Hickory Hills, and
who shall be authorized and empowered to: adopt, distribute and process
violation notices and other notices required by this section; collect money
paid as fines and penalties for automated traffic law violations; administer
the administrative adjudication system for automated traffic law violations;
draft and issue any certified reports to the Illinois Secretary of State as
required by this section; and make the recorded images of a violation
accessible to an alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a
website address, accessible through the Internet.
   Automated traffic law enforcement system means a device within the City of
Hickory Hills with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction
with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering
an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation
of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (“Code”), 625 ILCS 5/11-306, or
similar violation of the Municipal Code of the City of Hickory Hills.
   Automatic traffic law violation means a “disregarding a traffic control
device” violation, as that phrase is defined in this section.
   Certified report means a report to the Illinois Secretary of State
concerning five (5) or more unsatisfied automated traffic law violations.
   Code means Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq.
   Disregarding a traffic control device means: (i) a failure to stop and
remain stopped before an intersection that is controlled by a red signal as
provided for in Section 11-306 of the Code; or (ii) a failure to stop and
remain stopped, and not proceeding to turn right at, an intersection controlled
by both a sign indicating “No turn on red,” or other similar language, and a
red signal as provided for in Section 11-306 of the Code. Disregarding a
traffic control device, for purposes of the automated traffic law enforcement
system, shall not include: (1) those instances when a motor vehicle comes to a
complete stop and does not enter the intersection, as defined by Section 1-132
of the Code, during the cycle of the red signal unless one or more pedestrians
or bicyclists are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a
stop line or crosswalk where the driver is required to stop, as specified in
Section 11-306(c) of the Code, or similar violation of the Municipal Code of
the City of Hickory Hills; or (2) those instances where a motorcyclist enters
an intersection against a red signal indication when the red signal fails to
change to green within a reasonable period of time because of a signal
malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of the
motorcycle due to the motorcycle’s size or weight.
   Recorded images means images produced by the automated traffic law
enforcement system, which consist of either: two or more photographs; two or
more microphotographs; two or more electronic images; or a video recording
showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the
recording, clearly identifying the registration plate number of the motor
vehicle.
   (a)   System Established. There is established within the City an automated
traffic law enforcement system program.
      1.   The City shall have the discretion to locate individual automated
traffic law enforcement systems at such intersections as may be deemed
appropriate.
      2.   An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement
system shall be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating
that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law
enforcement system.
      3.   The City shall provide notice to drivers on its website of the
location of all intersections equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system.
      4.   Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement
system shall have a yellow change interval that conforms to the Illinois Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (IMUTCD) published by the Illinois
Department of Transportation.
   (b)   Violation. It shall be unlawful to “disregard a traffic control
device” as that phrase is defined in this section.
   (c)   Notice of Violation. When the automated traffic law enforcement system
records a motor vehicle violating subsection (b) of this section, the
Administrator shall issue a written violation notice to the registered owner of
the vehicle, which shall be mailed within thirty (30) days after the Illinois
Secretary of State notifies the City of the identity of the registered owner of
the vehicle, and in no event later than ninety (90) days following the
violation. If any notice to an addressee is returned as undeliverable, a second
notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post
Office approved database of the owner of the cited vehicle. The second notice
shall be made via first class mail postage prepaid. Service shall be complete
on the date the notice is placed in the United States mail.
   No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease
agreement shall be liable for an automated traffic law enforcement system
violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided
that upon the request of the Administrator received within 120 days after the
violation occurred, the lessor provides within sixty (60) days after such
receipt the name and address of the lessee. The driver’s license number of a
lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the Administrator if
needed for enforcement purposes. Upon the provision of information by the
lessor, the Administrator shall issue the violation notice to the lessee of the
vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation notice to a registered
owner, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation, and all other
provisions applicable to owners in this section shall apply to the lessee.
   Before a violation notice is issued, a determination must be made by a
technician employed or contracted by the City that, based on the inspection of
recorded images generated by the system, the motor vehicle was being operated
in violation of subsection (b) of this section. Upon determination that the
recorded image captures a violation, a violation notice shall be issued and
served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. If
the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of
a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency
vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. The Administrator, or his/her
designee, shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and
other correspondence mailed to the registered owner of the motor vehicle. Such
documents shall be kept in the ordinary course of business. Each violation
notice and the recorded images shall constitute evidence of the facts contained
in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding relative to the violation,
and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation.
   The violation notice shall include the following information:
      1.   the name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database;
      2.   the make (only if discernable) and registration number of the motor
vehicle involved in the violation;
      3.   the violation charged;
      4.   the location where the violation occurred;
      5.   the date and time of the violation;
      6.   a copy of the recorded images;
      7.   the amount of the civil fine imposed, and the date on which the
civil fine should be paid;
      8.   a statement that recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of
a violation;
      9.   a statement that a failure to pay the civil fine, or to contest
liability in a timely fashion, is an admission of liability and may result in
the suspension of driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle, as
well as the imposition of additional penalty of $100 for failure to pay the
original fine in a timely manner, and any costs of collection;
      10.   a statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine
or challenging the charge at the administrative hearing;
      11.   a statement that the payment of any fine, and the payment of any
applicable penalty for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of
the violation;
      12.   a statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested; and
      13.   a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the
person may view the recorded images of the violation.
   (d)   Hearing. The registered owner or lessee of a motor vehicle being
operated in violation of subsection (b) of this section may request a hearing
in persona to challenge the evidence or contest the citation by mail. The
violation notice shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to
rebuttal on the basis of applicable defenses. Formal rules of evidence will not
apply at the hearing. Hearings shall be recorded, and the hearing officer shall
be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance
and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant book and papers.
Persons appearing at the hearing may be represented by counsel at their own
expense. A registered owner or lessee that fails to appear at a hearing which
he/she has requested will be found in default and a final determination will be
entered.
   The following defenses are the only defenses that may be considered by the
Hearing Officer for a violation of subsection (b) of this section:
      1.   the operator of the vehicle was issued a Uniform Traffic Control
Citation by a police officer for the same incident;
      2.   the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the
possession of the owner at the time of the violation. Provided, however, to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen
before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a
report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed
with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner;
      3.   the vehicle was leased to another, and within sixty (60) days after
the citation was mailed to the lessor, lessor submitted to the City, together
with a copy of the lease agreement, the lessee’s driver’s license number, and
any additional information as may be required;
      4.   the vehicle was an authorized emergency vehicle;
      5.   the operator of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the
light was red in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as
part of a funeral procession; or,
      6.   the respondent was not the registered vehicle owner or lessee of the
cited vehicle at the time of the violation.
   Individuals who have been served with a violation notice may contest the
validity of the violation, using the same available defenses as stated above,
without personally appearing at the administrative hearing. To do so, the
individual must complete and return the remittance portion of the violation
notice. Additionally, the individual shall submit a notarized statement of the
facts that he is relying upon to establish any one of the defenses referenced
in this section. The individual may also submit documentary evidence to be
considered by the Hearing Officer. By returning the remittance, the individual
acknowledges that he is waiving the right to appear personally before the
Hearing Officer.
   Any individual wishing to avail himself of this section must submit the
remittance and any other documentation to be considered by the Hearing Officer,
to the City, by the respond-by date listed on the violation notice. The
Administrator shall forward all timely-submitted materials to the Hearing
Officer for review and determination. The Hearing Officer shall make an
adjudication based upon the facts set forth in the notarized statement of facts
filed, any additional documentary evidence, and the facts contained in the
violation notice. Notice of the determination of the Hearing Officer shall be
served via first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the addressed to the
registered owner at the address listed on the Illinois Secretary of State
database. Service of the notice shall be complete on the date the notice is
placed in the United States mail. Any individual may seek review of the Hearing
Officer’s determination through the mechanisms provided in this section.
   No additional fee shall be charged to an alleged violator for exercising the
right to an administrative hearing.
   (e)   Final Determination. A final determination of an automated traffic law
violation liability shall occur under the following circumstances:
      1.   upon the failure to pay the fine or penalty after the Hearing
Officer’s determination of liability and the exhaustion of or failure to
exhaust administrative review; or
      2.   where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged
violation in the time and manner specified, the Hearing Officer’s determination
shall become final upon the denial of a timely petition to set aside a
determination, or upon the expiration of the period for filing the petition
without a filing having been made.
   (f)   Notice of Final Determination. A final determination of an automated
traffic law violation notice shall be sent following the final determination of
automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial
review. The notice shall include the following information:
      1.   a statement that the unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing
the City of Hickory Hills; and
      2.   a warning that a failure to pay any fine or penalty due and owing
the City of Hickory Hills may result in the filing of a petition in the Circuit
Court of Cook County to have unpaid fine or penalty rendered as a judgment or
may result in the suspension of the person’s driver’s license for failure to
pay fines or penalties for five (5) or more automated traffic law violations.
   (g)   Petition to Set Aside Determination. A petition to set aside
determination of an automated traffic law violation must be filed with or
mailed to the Administrator within fourteen (14) days of the date of mailing of
the final determination of liability notice. The grounds for the petition are
limited to:
      1.   the person was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the
date of the violation occurred;
      2.   the person has paid the fine or penalty for the violation in
question; or
      3.   excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing.
   Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of
liability, the Administrator, or his designee, shall review the petition to
determine if sufficient cause has been shown to set aside the determination. If
cause has been shown, the Administrator shall forward to the petitioner a new
hearing date on which the petitioner must appear to present his case on the
underlying violation. The Administrator shall notify the petitioner of his
decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within fourteen (14) days of
his decision.
   (h)   Notice of Impending Driver’s License Suspension. A notice of impending
driver’s license suspension shall be sent to the person liable for failing to
pay any fine or penalty that remains due and owing on five (5) or more
automated traffic law violations. The notice shall state the following
information:
      1.   the failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within forty-five (45)
days of the notice’s date will result in the Administrator notifying the
Illinois Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of
suspension proceedings under Section 6-306.5 of the Code; and
      2.   a statement that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of the
original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped
envelope to the Administrator along with a request for the copy.
   The notice shall be sent via first class mail, postage prepaid, to the
address recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State or, if any notice to that
address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a
United States Post Office approved database.
   (i)   Driver’s License Suspension. The Administrator, by certified report,
shall request that the Illinois Secretary of State suspend the driving
privileges of an owner of a registered vehicle or lessee who has failed to pay
any fine or penalty due and owing the City of Hickory Hills as a result of five
(5) automated traffic law violations. The report shall be certified and contain
the following information:
      1.   the name, last known address as recorded with the Illinois Secretary
of State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease,
or as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice
sent under this section is returned as undeliverable, and driver’s license
number of the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty, or who has
defaulted in a payment plan, and the registration number of any vehicle known
to be registered to such person in the State of Illinois;
      2.   the name of the municipality making the report;
      3.   a statement that a suspension notice has been sent to the person
named in the report at the address recorded with the Illinois Secretary of
State or at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the
time of the lease or, if any notice is returned as undeliverable, at the last
known address recorded at a United States Post office approved database; the
date on which such notice was sent; and address to which such notice was sent;
and,
      4.   an unique identifying reference number for each request of
suspension.
   The Administrator shall notify the Illinois Secretary of State whenever a
person named in the certified report has paid the previously recorded fine or
penalty, whenever the person has entered into a payment plan pursuant to which
the City has agreed to terminate the suspension, or whenever the City
determines that the original report was in error. A certified copy of such
notification shall also be given to the person named therein upon request and
at no additional charge.
   (j)   Challenging the Accuracy of a Certified Report. If the Administrator
provides a suspension notice and subsequently makes a certified report to the
Illinois Secretary of State, the vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of
the certified report in writing.
   The vehicle owner shall submit to the Administrator a written statement
under oath, together with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the
following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the certified report:
      1.   that the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle
or vehicles receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law violations on the
date or dates such violation(s) occurred; or
      2.   that the person already paid the fine or penalty owing indicated on
the certified report.
   A statement challenging the accuracy of a certified report shall be sent to
the Administrator via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-
delivered to the Administrator within five (5) days after the person receives
notice from the Illinois Secretary of State that the person’s driver’s license
will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the secretary
is presented with notice from the City certifying that the fines or penalties
due and owing have been satisfied or that the inclusion of the person’s name on
the certified report was in error.
   (k)   Penalty. Any person violating section 6-109 of this section shall be
fined $100 for each offense. If a person fails pay the applicable fine within
fourteen (14) days following a Final Determination of Liability, an additional
penalty of $100 will be automatically assessed against the violator. Any costs
incurred by the City to collect penalties (including attorney’s fees and
collection agency fees) not paid in a timely manner shall be assessed against a
violator.

   (c)   Seizures and Impoundment of Vehicles. A motor vehicle used in the
manner described in subsection (b) shall be subject to seizure and impoundment.
Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer
shall cause the motor vehicle to be towed to a facility controlled by the City
or its agents. When the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any
person identifying himself or herself as the owner of the vehicle or any person
who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the
vehicle owners right to request a preliminary hearing as provided in subsection
(e). Any police officer who has probable cause to believe that the vehicle is
subject to seizure and impoundment under this section shall first ascertain
whether the impoundment is necessary and reasonable under the circumstances. If
the vehicle is capable of being removed from the scene by an individual who is
present on the scene, and who has permission from the owner of the vehicle to
drive the vehicle, and the individual is otherwise capable of lawfully
operating a motor vehicle in the State of Illinois, the police officer shall
allow that individual to remove the vehicle without being subject to seizure
and impoundment. Similarly, if the vehicle is parked legally, and/or will not
present a hazard to the public safety or otherwise jeopardize the efficient
movement of vehicular traffic at its location, the officer shall permit the
vehicle to remain at its location without being seized or impounded pursuant to
this subsection. This determination shall not apply when the vehicle is
required to be seized or impounded due to investigative measures or when a
vehicle is seized or impounded pursuant to another lawful purpose. When a
vehicle is not seized or impounded pursuant to this section, the owner shall
not be required to post the requisite a $500.00 bond as referenced in
subsection (d).
   (d)   Posting a Bond. Any vehicle seized and impounded under subsection (c)
shall be held as bond to secure the personal appearance of the owner at the
administrative hearing. If a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 is posted with
the City, the impounded vehicle will be released to the owner of record, upon
the payment by the owner of record of the towing and storage costs. If a
penalty is imposed for a violation of subsection (b), the cash bond will be
forfeited to the City; provided, however, in the event that a violation of
subsection (b) is not proven, the cash bond will be returned to the person
posting the bond. All cash bond money posted pursuant to this subsection will
be held by the City until the hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there
is a judicial review, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.
   (e)   Preliminary Hearing. Where the owner of a motor vehicle seized under
the provisions of this section requests a preliminary hearing within twelve
(12) hours after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the Watch Commander or any
supervising officer must conduct a preliminary hearing within twenty-four (24)
hours after the request for preliminary hearing is received by the City;
provided, however, that if the date for the hearing falls on a Saturday,
Sunday, or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next
business day following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. No preliminary
hearing shall be required or granted to an owner whose vehicle was not seized
or impounded pursuant to this section. For purposes of this subsection, the
following shall apply:
      1.   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the preliminary hearing.
      2.   The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay testimony will be allowed, and will be admissible.
      3.   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Watch Commander or
supervising officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the
vehicle was used as hereinabove provided in subsection (b), he/she shall order
the continued impoundment of the vehicle, unless the owner of the vehicle posts
a cash bond with the City in the amount of $500.00, plus the towing and storage
costs.
      4.   If the Watch Commander or supervising officer determines that there
is not probable cause to believe that the vehicle was used as hereinabove
provided in subsection (b), the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of
record of the vehicle without any penalty or other costs.
   (f)   Final Hearing. The following procedures shall govern the final hearing

the business licensee or occupant of the premises as well as the alarm company
monitoring the premises. The notice shall inform the recipient of the reason

alarms have been transmitted in a 12-month period. A written notice of the

business licensee or occupant of the premises as well as the alarm company
monitoring the premises. The notice shall inform the recipient of the reason
for disconnection and shall allow the recipient a pre-disconnection opportunity
to be heard before the Chief of Police. If a party fails to request a hearing,
or if a hearing is held and the party fails to demonstrate the non-
chargeability of the false transmissions to the Chief of Police, the service
shall be disconnected.
   (d)   If any alarm service or audible outside sound transmitter has been
ordered to be disconnected under paragraph (b) or (c) and a false alarm is
transmitted from the same premises, a fee of $250 for each such false alarm

abatement of such nuisance by any legal means.
