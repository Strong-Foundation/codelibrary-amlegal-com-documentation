filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior

any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

   (G)   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or

be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

devices; or

discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state,
who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to
ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued,
without charge, a license to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be
the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same
requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.
The license may be revoked by the department at its discretion.

telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined

systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems, and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a
taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are
sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or licensees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a village and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by
this chapter.

ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,

a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 1166, 10-8-2012)
3-10-2: TAX IMPOSED:
A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   (A)   The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the
village intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%)
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the village or receiving in the
village interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent (6%)
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multistate taxation of the act or privilege that is
subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the
extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state
which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local
tax in this state.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
village. (Ord. 1166, 10-8-2012)
3-10-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 1166, 10-8-2012)
3-10-4: RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT:
On or before the last day of February 2003, and on or before the last day of
every month thereafter, the tax imposed under this chapter on telecommunication
retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and information as required
by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement the
act. (Ord. 1166, 10-8-2012)
3-10-5: RESELLERS:
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 1166, 10-8-2012)

In the event any building plans are required to be examined by any agency other
than the village, then any costs or fees so incurred by the village shall be
paid by the applicant in addition to the above listed schedule of fees.
      1.   Starting Construction Without An Issued Permit: The above listed
fees may be doubled in addition to any fine which may be imposed for all
construction started before a permit is issued.
      2.   Water Usage: In addition to the above listed fees and in all cases
of new, single-family construction, the village shall charge an additional fee
of twenty five dollars ($25.00) per building permit which charge shall be
collected and paid to the village's water fund for purposes of offsetting the
village's cost of potable water used and consumed by the building permit
applicant prior to the installation of a water meter as required under
applicable ordinance. The use of water during the period prior to the
installation of water meters shall be unmetered, provided that the
superintendent of public works may elect to terminate the unmetered water use
if the quantity of water so consumed exceeds customary construction required
needs. The use of such unmetered water for purposes of the filling of swimming
pools, watering of lawns, and landscaping is strictly prohibited and shall be
immediate grounds for the superintendent of public works to immediately and
without notice terminate such unmetered water use.
      3.   Administrative Fee: In addition to the above listed fees, the
village shall charge an administrative fee in the amount of ten percent (10%)
of the permit or inspection fee for all permits or inspections being applied
for or requested, but in an amount not less than a ten dollar ($10.00) minimum.
   (D)   Building Permit; Application Procedures:
      1.   Permit and contractor's forms shall be completely filled out when
submitting applications. Two (2) copies of each of the structure, electrical,
and plumbing blueprints must accompany permit applications. Any changes made to
blueprints after the initial submission must be filed with the village. All
plans and blueprints submitted with the application must have an architectural
seal thereon. Failure of applicant and/or contractor to submit blueprint
changes shall subject the applicant and/or contractor to a minimum fine of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) with a maximum fine not to exceed seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00).
      2.   Village personnel are to authenticate all contractors', business,
electrical and plumbers' licenses, including journeyman and apprentice
licenses. A license is also required for a roofer.
      3.   If any license is found invalid, the permit application shall be
returned to the applicant with an explanation of the return.
      4.   Upon approval by the inspection service and all of the inspectors,
the permit will be issued and the homeowner, general contractor or contractors
will be informed of the forty eight (48) hour notice procedure for inspections
by the village inspection service. Cards will be provided to the applicant for
inspection contact information and that inspection requests should be made to
the inspection service, not the village hall.
      5.   All building permits for new construction of primary structures
expire after twelve (12) months from the issuance date. All other permits shall
expire after ninety (90) days of the issuance date unless otherwise explicitly
stated in writing on the permit by the village's inspection service. In the
event reapplication is made for a building permit, a six (6) month extension
shall be granted for one-half (1/2) of the original building permit fee, or
twenty five dollars ($25.00), whichever is greater. After a period of eighteen
(18) months from the original issuance date of the building permit, a renewal
of the building permit may be made for double the original building permit fee.
After a period of thirty (30) months from the issuance date of the original
building permit, a renewal of the building permit can be made for triple the
original building permit fee. After a period of forty two (42) months after the
issuance date of the original building permit, a renewal of the building permit
can be made for quadruple the original building permit fee. In no event shall a
building permit be allowed to be renewed or in effect for a period of longer
than fifty four (54) months. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for structures
which are entitled to a certificate of occupancy but are being used as model
homes or sales offices, the applicant may pay a renewal fee of two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) for a twelve (12) month building permit extension and
pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for every six (6) month building permit
extension thereafter while the home is being used as a model home or sales
office. The village's inspection service shall determine which structures
qualify for a certificate of occupancy but are in use as a model home or sales
office.
      6.   The village has no duty to notify a permittee of a pending
expiration of a permit. Once the permit expires prior to final inspection, the
village shall conduct a compliance inspection of the property to determine the
status of the project and whether or not permit violations exist.
   (E)   Building Permit Review: All applications will be reviewed by the
inspection service within seven (7) days of receipt. Fees for building permits
and any other fees (sewer and water tap in fees, and others specified by
village ordinance) shall be paid prior to issuance of the permit.
   (F)   Refunds For Permits Not Issued Or Not Used:
      1.   A refund shall not be issued if the fee collected is less than
twenty five dollars ($25.00);
      2.   For collected fees over twenty five dollars ($25.00), the Village
shall retain twenty five dollars ($25.00) plus twenty five percent (25%) of the
amount in excess of twenty five dollars ($25.00), but in no event shall the
amount retained exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00); and
      3.   No refund shall be issued for a fee of any costs incurred for the
examination of plans by any agency outside the Village. (Ord. 1169, 11-11-2012;

additional reinspection fees have been paid, if required. If occupancy occurs

disconnected and a fine may be issued. Each day of occupancy without an issued
certificate of occupancy constitutes a separate offense and is subject to
additional fines. The Police Department may assist in the eviction of an
illegal occupant.
   (B)   New Construction; Temporary Certificate Provisions: For new
construction, a certificate of occupancy will not be issued until all
improvements are made to the property, including sidewalk, driveway,
landscaping and interior components as required by the Building Code.
The only exception shall be in the winter months when it is not feasible to
pour concrete or landscape. In these instances, a temporary certificate of
occupancy or permission will be granted for temporary occupancy as may be
required. An escrow deposit of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), as
determined by the Village will be required to cover the cost of the
improvements. Once the improvements are completed to the Village's
satisfaction, the deposit will be returned in full without interest and a
certificate of occupancy will be issued.

install a "knox box" or key box provided at cost to the owner by the Beecher

period of construction at the expense of applicant. It may be removed only
after a valid certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Village. This
requirement shall apply to all new building construction, whether residential,
commercial or industrial. In the event any projects are undertaken before said
portable sanitary facilities have been made available on site, the Village may
revoke any previously issued building permits, and issue a "stop work" order.
No further work shall take place at, or upon any property, until and unless the
violation has been waived in writing by the Village building inspector. A
reinspection fee of no less than fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed in

vehicle is the record titleholder as registered with the secretary of state as
of the date of the impoundment.
      1.   Whenever a police officer has cause to believe that a motor vehicle
is subject to impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall
provide for the towing of the motor vehicle to a facility controlled by the
village or its agents. When the motor vehicle is towed, the police officer
shall notify or make reasonable attempt to notify the owner, lessee, or person
identifying himself or herself as the owner or lessee of the vehicle, or the
person who is found to be in control of the motor vehicle at the time of the

heard at the preliminary hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply
at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the village corporation counsel, or
designee, determines that there is cause to believe that the motor vehicle was
used in the violation of subsection (A) of this section, then the village
corporation counsel, or designee shall order the continued impoundment of the
motor vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle posts
with the village a cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
plus fees for towing and storing the motor vehicle. If the village corporation
counsel, or designee, determines that there is no such cause, the motor vehicle
will be returned without penalty or other fees.
      3.   Within ten (10) days after a motor vehicle is impounded pursuant to
this section, the village shall notify by personal service or first class mail,
the owner of record or lessee of the vehicle, and any lienholder of record, of
the date, time and location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to
this section. The hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by
order of the court or hearing officer, not more than forty five (45) days after
the date of mailing or personal service. All interested persons shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The hearing shall be
conducted by a hearing officer who is an attorney licensed to practice law in
Illinois for a minimum of three (3) years. At the conclusion of the hearing,
the hearing officer shall issue a written decision either sustaining or
overruling the vehicle impoundment. If after a hearing, it is determined by a
preponderance of evidence that the motor vehicle was used in the commission of
any of the violations described in subsection (A) of this section, the motor
vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the owner pays a penalty of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) plus fees for towing and storage of the motor
vehicle. The penalty and fees shall be a debt due and owing the village.
However, if a cash bond has been posted, then the bond shall be applied to the
penalty. If it is determined at a hearing that the motor vehicle was not used
in such a violation, the vehicle or cash bond shall be returned without penalty
or other fees. All final decisions of the administrative hearing officer shall
be subject to review under the provisions of the Illinois administrative review
law. Unless the administrative hearing officer overturns the basis for the
vehicle impoundment, no vehicle shall be released to the owner, lessee, or
lienholder of record until all administrative penalties and towing and storage
charges are paid. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, whenever
a person with a lien of record against a motor vehicle impounded under this
section has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle
shall be given to that person if that person agrees in writing to refund to the
village the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amount necessary to
pay all lienholders of record, up to the total amount of fees and penalties
imposed under this section.
      4.   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within thirty five (35) days
after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek
judicial review of the village's action under this section, or the time at
which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time a final
administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in
default, shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of as an abandoned or
unclaimed motor vehicle as provided by law in accordance with the provisions of
article II of chapter 4 of the Illinois vehicle code, as amended. (Ord. 1173,

limits of the Village of Beecher, the subdivider thereof or his agent shall
submit both a preliminary and a final subdivision plat to the Plan Commission
for its approval. The subdivision plats and all procedures relating thereto
shall in all respects be in full compliance with these regulations.
   (B)   Until plats and plans for any subdivision have been properly reviewed

Village of Beecher:
      1.   No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any
improvements made to the natural land.

lighting, grading, paving or surfacing of streets -- shall hereafter be made by
any owner or owners or his or their agent, or by any public service corporation
at the request of such owner or owners or his or their agent.
      4.   No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains poor drainage facilities and which would
make adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However, if the
subdivider agrees in writing and submits such an agreement to make such
improvements which will, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, make the area

provisions of this Title shall be held to be the minimum requirements.
   (B)   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this Title upon the
use of land are either more restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by
any provision or any other ordinance or of any law, resolution, rule or
regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which
impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
   (C)   This Title is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any
other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this Title are
more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such
easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this
Title shall govern.
   (D)   All administrative interpretations of these rules and regulations are
reserved to the Plan Commission.
11-1-7: EXCEPTIONS AND VARIATIONS:
In specific cases where the subdivider can show that a provision of these
regulations, if strictly adhered to, would cause unnecessary hardship because
of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, and that a departure
may be made without destroying the intent of such provision, the Plan
Commission may recommend a variation or modification of the required standard
or regulation. Such recommendation shall be communicated to the Board of
Trustees or governing county authorities in writing with the reasons therefore.
The Board of Trustees may approve variations from the requirements of this
Title when, in its opinion, such variations will not adversely affect the
intent of this Title.
11-1-8: FEES:
A fee shall be paid to the village clerk at the time of submission of the
preliminary and final plat. No plat shall be reviewed by the plan commission
without a receipt from the village clerk being exhibited by the subdivider

11-2-3:Procedure For Preliminary Plat Approval
11-2-4:Procedure For Final Plat Approval
11-2-5:Agreements
11-2-1: PRELIMINARY; FINAL PLAT SUBMITTED:
Before subdividing any tract or parcel of land within the corporate limits of
the village or the unincorporated areas within one and one-half (11/2) miles
beyond the village limits, an owner or subdivider shall submit a preliminary
plan and a final plat to be acted upon by the village authorities in accordance
with the procedures and requirements of this title. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-2-2: PREAPPLICATION PROCEDURE:
   (A)   Prior to the filing of an application for approval of the preliminary
plan, it is recommended that the owner or subdivider consult with the plan
commission and other village officials to secure information relative to land
use and zoning requirements, subdivision regulations, and other applicable
village ordinances. The purpose of the preapplication stage is to afford the
subdivider the opportunity to obtain the advice and assistance of the plan
commission and to discuss the proposed development informally with members of
said commission prior to preparation of the preliminary plat in order to save
time and money and to make the most of his opportunities. This step does not
require formal application, fee or filing of plans with the village clerk.
   (B)   Before the meeting with the plan commission, it is suggested that the
subdivider prepare a sketch plan of the proposed development on a topographic
survey of the
area showing the proposed layout of streets, arrangement of lots, and other
features in relation to existing conditions. The sketch plan may be a free-hand
pencil sketch made directly on a print of the topographic survey.
11-2-3: PROCEDURE FOR PRELIMINARY PLAT APPROVAL:
   (A)   The subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plan, together
with improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in Section
11-3-1 of this Title. The plan shall include all of the property owned or
controlled by the applicant which is adjacent to or considered to be contiguous
to the proposed subdivision.
   (B)   Ten (10) copies of the preliminary plan and supplementary material
specified shall be submitted to the secretary of the Plan Commission with
written application for approval.
   (C)   The Plan Commission shall transmit copies of the preliminary plan and
supplementary material for review and comment to the Village's Planner,
Engineer and to appropriate school, park and fire districts providing required
public facilities and services. Comments and recommendations shall be returned
to the Plan Commission within thirty (30) days. The Plan Commission shall
promptly thereafter review all the plans and documentation required for
preliminary plat approval in accordance with the standards herein set forth.
   (D)   The Plan Commission shall approve or disapprove the application for
preliminary plat approval within ninety (90) days from the date of filing the
application or the filing by the applicant of the last item of required
supporting documents, whichever date is later, unless such time is extended by
mutual consent. Approval of a preliminary plat by the Plan Commission is
strictly tentative, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout
and proposals as submitted.
   (E)   Following action by the Plan Commission, the preliminary plat and the
recommendation of the Plan Commission shall be referred to the Village Board of
Trustees. If the Plan Commission approves the plat, it shall be so indicated on
the plat; if it disapproves such plat, it shall furnish the Board of Trustees
and the applicant a written statement setting forth the reasons for
disapproval. The Board of Trustees shall accept or reject said plat within
thirty (30) days after its regular stated meeting following the action of the
Plan Commission.
   (F)   Approval of the preliminary plat shall be effective for a maximum
period of one year, unless upon application of the developer, the Village Board
of Trustees grants an extension. The application for said extension shall not
require an additional filing fee, or the submittal of additional copies of the
plan of subdivision.
11-2-4: PROCEDURE FOR FINAL PLAT APPROVAL:
   (A)   The owner or subdivider shall file an application for approval of the
final plat with the Village Clerk within one year after approval of the
preliminary plat. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary
plat as approved and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that
portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and
develop at that time, provided however, that such portion conforms to all the
requirements of these regulations.
   (B)   The application for final plat approval shall include the original
drawing, drawn with ink on linen tracing cloth or mylar, one transparency print
and four (4) copies of all supporting maps, plans and other drawings, and all
other required documents. The application shall be submitted in writing and
shall be accompanied by the fee required in these regulations. The Board of
Trustees shall refer the application for approval of the final plat to the Plan
Commission for its review and recommendations and approval or disapproval.
   (C)   Upon receipt of these final plans, the Plan Commission shall refer
copies of said plan and all supporting documents to the Village's Planner,
Engineer, Attorney and any agency providing required public facilities that
should be consulted prior to approval. All comments and recommendations shall
be returned to the Plan Commission within thirty (30) days. When applicable,
the Plan Commission may require the subdivider to submit written statements
from County, State, or other public officials as may be concerned, indicating
that proposals for storm drainage, sewage disposal and water supply meet the
minimum requirements for such installations.
   (D)   The Plan Commission shall approve or disapprove the application for
final plat approval within sixty (60) days from the date of filing the
application or the filing by the applicant of the last item of required
supporting documents, whichever date is later, unless such time is extended by
mutual consent. If the Plan Commission approves, it shall fix upon the plat the
certifying signatures of its chairman and secretary. If it disapproves, it
shall set forth its reasons in its own records and provide the applicant with a
Copy.
   (E)   After approval of the final plat by the Plan Commission, it shall be
submitted to the Village Board of Trustees for approval. The Village Board must
take action on the final plat within thirty (30) days, unless this time period
is extended by mutual consent of the applicant and the Board of Trustees.
   (F)   Upon approval by the Village Board of Trustees, the subdivider shall
record the final plat of subdivision with the County Recorder. Immediately
after recording, the original or a duly certified copy of the recorded plat
shall be filed with the Village Clerk. The developer shall furnish the Village
Clerk with three (3) additional copies to be distributed as follows: one copy
each to the Village Engineer, the Village Public Works Department and the Plan
Commission.
11-2-5: AGREEMENTS:
   (A)   Any owner or subdivider filing an application for approval of a final
plat shall submit to the Plan Commission and the Village Board the final plat,
in the form in which it is to be recorded, and a statement of agreement that:
      1.   The land improvements required in Chapter 5 of this Title shall be
completed by the owner or subdivider in accordance with the plans and
specifications approved by the Village Engineer and Board of Trustees and that
within two (2) years following the approval of the final plat, the subdivider
will file with the Village Clerk a complete set of plans and specifications
showing such improvements as installed.
      2.   The subdivider shall in all cases be responsible for the maintenance
of all improvements for one year following their acceptance by the Village, and
shall guarantee such maintenance by posting cash or negotiable securities in
the amount of five percent (5%) of the cost of such improvements. The
fulfillment of this requirement is a condition to approval of the final plat,
and is in addition to the requirements of paragraph (B) of this Section.
      3.   The subdivider shall reimburse the Village for all engineering costs
incurred by the Village in connection with preparing or checking preliminary
and final cost estimates, working drawings, specifications and in executing
inspection responsibilities.
   (B)   Prior to recording the final plat, the owner or subdivider shall
guarantee the completion of all public improvements in compliance with approved
working drawings and specifications and shall guarantee to maintain said
improvements until they are accepted by the Village. This guarantee shall be by
one or a combination of one or more of the three (3) following methods. Only
one method shall apply to one specified improvement.
      1.   The subdivider may post a performance bond prepared in a form
approved by the Village Attorney and underwritten by a surety company listed as
approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount of the bond shall be not less
than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the final estimate of cost of
the improvement as approved by the Village Engineer. There shall be no
reduction in the amount of that portion of the bond applying to a particular
improvement unless and until that improvement is completed and accepted or
approved by the Board of Trustees. The sub-grade, base course and surface
course of a street, alley or parking area shall be considered a single
improvement from the standpoint of acceptance.
      2.   The subdivider may deposit a cash bond with the Village in
accordance with a specific escrow agreement approved by the Village Attorney
and the Village Board of Trustees and in an amount not less than one hundred
twenty five percent (125%) of the final estimate of cost of the improvements,
as estimated by the developer and approved by the Village Engineer. The deposit
shall be held in a special account by the Village, and the agreement may
provide for partial payouts as work progresses in amounts recommended by the
Village Engineer and approved by the Village Board of Trustees as corresponding
to the original estimate of unit costs. Partial payouts shall be contingent
upon favorable inspection and inspection reports, and the sum of partial
payouts for a single improvement is not to exceed eighty percent (80%) of the
original deposit for the improvement until and unless the improvement is
completed and accepted or approved by the Board of Trustees. The sub-grade,
base course and surface course of a street, alley or parking area shall be
considered a single improvement from the standpoint of acceptance.
      3.   The subdivider may deposit a letter of credit with the Village,
issued by a bank, savings and loan, other financial institution, or person,
approved by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Beecher,
guaranteeing that the subdivider will complete within a reasonable time all
public improvements in accordance with the working drawings and specifications
for such improvements on file with the Village Clerk, and in default thereof
guaranteeing payment for the completion of all such public improvements. The
form of the letter of credit shall be approved by the Village Attorney and the
Village Board of Trustees. The letter of credit shall be irrevocable and may be
transferred or assigned by the Village to the person completing such public
improvements in the event of default by the subdivider. The bond or security
required by this Section shall not be required to be filed with the Village
until such time as the Village Board has approved the plat covering the public
improvements hereinabove mentioned and has advised the subdivider or applicant
of such approval.
   (C)   The Village Clerk shall not certify the approval of the Board of
Trustees on the final plat until the required bond, or deposit or cash or other
guarantee, has been filed as required by this Section. (Ord. 468, 11-8-76)

necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
   (D)   Where a subdivision borders on, or contains, a railroad or highway,
the Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each
side of such a railroad or highway, at a distance suitable for the appropriate
use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or
for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances
shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.
   (E)   Reserve strips controlling access to public utilities or streets shall
be prohibited.
   (F)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty
degrees (60°).
   (G)   When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than ten degrees (10°), they shall be connected by a curve with a
radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than two hundred feet
(200') for minor streets, three hundred feet (300') for collector streets and
of such greater radii as the Plan Commission shall determine for special cases.
   (H)   A tangent at least one hundred feet (100') long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on all major arterial and collector streets.
   (I)   Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty
feet (150') shall be avoided.
   (J)   Street right-of-way widths shall be as shown on the official map and
where not shown therein shall not be less than as follows:
 
Street Type            Right Of Way (Feet)

Secondary arterial     80
Collector street       70
Minor street           60
Cul-de-sac streets     60
Marginal access street 40
 
   (K)   Half streets shall be prohibited, except when recommended of the Plan
Commission and approved by the Board of Trustees, and where the Board of
Trustees finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other
half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever an existing dedicated
half street abuts a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall
be platted within such a subdivision.
   (L)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not be more than five hundred feet (500') in
length, measured along its center line from the street of origin to the end of
its right of way. Each cul-de- sac street shall have a terminus of nearly
circular shape with a minimum diameter of one hundred twenty feet (120') with a
paved turn-around having an outside pavement diameter of at least eighty feet
(80'). Where an existing street terminates at the boundary line of a proposed
subdivision, either the street shall be continued in the street pattern of the
proposed subdivision or a turn-around shall be provided in the proposed
subdivision.
   (M)   Street gradients and vertical curves shall be as specified in the
Table of Minimum Standards for Street Design.
   (N)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Existing street names shall be projected
whenever possible. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Plan
Commission.
11-4-3: ALLEYS AND PEDESTRIAN WAYS:
   (A)   Alleys shall be prohibited in residential areas except where special
conditions may necessitate their use - and only then, when recommended by the
Plan Commission and approved by the Village Board.
   (B)   Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts,
except that the Plan Commission may waive this requirement where other definite
and assured provisions are made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking, consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.
   (C)   The width of an alley where permitted or required, shall not be less
than twenty feet (20') in residential areas and not less than thirty feet (30')
in commercial and industrial districts.
   (D)   Dead end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable,
they shall be provided with adequate turn around facilities at the terminus, as
determined by the plan commission.
   (E)   Pedestrianways, when recommended by the plan commission and approved
by the board of trustees, shall be not less than fifteen feet (15') in width.
(Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-4-4: EASEMENTS:
   (A)   Utilities And Storm Water Drainage: Easements for utilities, and, when
required, storm water drainageways, shall be designated on the final plat of
subdivision. Such easements shall be located along the rear or side lot lines
and shall be designed to provide continuity from block to block. They shall be
at least twenty feet (20') wide, or may be of lesser or greater width only if
recommended by the village engineer and approved by the board of trustees.
(Ord. 700, 1-23-1995)
   (B)   Watercourses: Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural
drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement,
conforming substantially with the areas bordering such watercourse that are
subject to flooding. Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection
therewith. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
   (C)   Public Utility Service Connections: Each new residential electric,
cable television, or telephone service connection from any utility easement to
any new residence shall be connected so as to minimize the distance of lines
between the authorized easements or side property lines and the residence to be
so connected. All such service connections shall utilize existing utility
easements or adjacent side yard lines, and shall only cross a lot via the
closest distance between a side yard and the residence to be connected. It is
the intention of this subsection to mandate that utility service connections
within any owner's property shall be installed so as minimize or eliminate the
amount of rear yard that may contain any such utility service connections. A
violation of this provision shall be considered a business offense and shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for each day
of noncompliance. In addition, any violation of this provision shall authorize
the denial of a certificate of occupancy until a utility service connection
complies herewith. (Ord. 970, 8-25-2003)
11-4-5: BLOCK STANDARDS:
   (A)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with
regard to:
      1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the types of uses contemplated.
      2.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions.
      3.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
street traffic.
      4.   Limitations and opportunities of soil conditions and topography.
   (B)   Block shall not exceed one thousand five hundred feet (1,500') in
length, or be less than six hundred feet (600'). Where deemed necessary by the
plan commission, it may require a pedestrian crosswalk easement in or near the
middle of a block to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities.
   (C)   The number of intersecting streets along arterial streets and highways
shall be kept to a minimum. Wherever practicable, blocks along such trafficways
shall be not less than one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') in length.
   (D)   Blocks or portions thereof intended for commercial or industrial use
shall be designated as such, and the plan show adequate off street areas to
provide parking, loading docks and other such facilities. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-4-6: LOT STANDARDS:
   (A)   The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum
building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision
and for the type of development and use contemplated. Building setback lines
shall conform to the front yard provisions of the Beecher zoning ordinance.
   (B)   In general, lots should be as nearly rectangular in shape as
practicable.
   (C)   Lot dimensions and areas shall conform to the requirements of the
Beecher zoning ordinance or that of Will County in the unincorporated areas
beyond the village limits, but in no case shall a lot for residential purposes
in a new subdivision be less than sixty feet (60') wide at the building line,
nor less than seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet in area.
   (D)   All residential lots shall abut on a publicly dedicated street or on a
permanent easement of access to a public street not less than twenty feet (20')
in width.
   (E)   Side lot lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the
street line, unless a variation to this rule will give a better street or lot
plan.
   (F)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited in
residential districts except where lots back upon a major or secondary
thoroughfare, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten feet (10'), and across
which there shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be provided along the
rear lot lines of lots abutting such major or secondary thoroughfares.
   (G)   Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit
appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets.
   (H)   Lots abutting a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream shall
have an additional depth or width in order to provide acceptable building
sites.
   (I)   Depths and widths of lots or properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated.
   (J)   In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be given to the
preservation of natural features, such as trees, watercourses, historical
landmarks, and similar community assets, which, if preserved, would add to the
attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood or the community as a
whole. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-4-7: BUILDING SETBACK LINES:
Building setback lines in residential areas of new subdivisions shall conform
to the front yard provisions of the Beecher Zoning Ordinance, except that in no
case shall the building setback line be less than twenty five feet (25') from
the front property line. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-4-8: PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES:
   (A)   Where a proposed park, playground, school, or other public use shown
in a general development plan is located in whole or in part within a
subdivision, the Planning Commission may require the dedication or reservation
of such area within the subdivision. In such cases, if the Village Board deems
such requirements to be reasonable, the subdivider may be required to dedicate
or grant no less than five percent (5%) of the area of the proposed subdivision
for use as a public site.
   (B)   Where deemed essential by the Village Board, upon consideration of the
particular type of developments proposed in the subdivision, and especially in
large-scale planned unit developments not anticipated in the general
development plan of the Village, the Board may require the dedication or
reservation of such other areas or sites of a character, extent, and location
suitable to the needs created by such development for schools, parks, fire
stations or other neighborhood purposes. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-4-9: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES:
   (A)   As a condition of the approval of a final plat of subdivision, each
applicant, subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for school
sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
development, or a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a
combination of both, at the option of the Village, in accordance with the
following criteria and formula:
      1.   Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedication:
   (a)   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to
be generated by a subdivision shall bear directly upon the amount of land
required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement
shall be determined by obtaining the result of: 1) estimated student population
per dwelling unit for each school classification stated in subsection (A)3 of
this Section, Exhibit A, divided by 2) the maximum number of students for each
school classification as hereinafter set forth, multiplied by 3) the minimum
number of acres of land for each school site for each such classification as
hereinafter set forth. The result thereof shall be the acres of land deemed
needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated
increased children in each such school classification.
   (b)   School Classification And Size Of School Site: Classification and size
of school sites within the Village shall be determined in accordance with the
following criteria:
 
 
                     
                                               
                                               
                                               
                    Maximum Number Of Students Minimum Number Of Acres Of
                    For Each Such School       Land For Each School Site For
                    Classification             Such Classification
 
School Type/Grades
Elementary schools,  600 students               11 acres
grades K-5
Junior high schools, 700 students               29 acres
grades 6-8
High schools,        1,500 students             45 acres
grades 9-12
 
   (c)   Location: The Comprehensive School Plan and/or the standards adopted
by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
      2.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of School Sites: Where
the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or
when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the Village shall
require the builder, subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu
of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites
shall be held by the recipient school districts for use in the acquisition of
land to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision
or development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already
serves such needs. Improvement under this Section shall be liberally construed
and shall include, but shall not be limited to, the development of classrooms;
parking lots; sidewalks; traffic signals; arterial streets; collector streets;
internal roadways; connections with sewer, water and electrical lines;
playgrounds; recreation grounds and athletic fields. Improvement shall also
include the purchase of any material goods or equipment necessary to said
development and construction. Improvement shall further include the
construction of buildings; additions to existing school buildings; remodeled or
renovated noninstructional spaces in classrooms and the purchase of
prefabricated classroom units to be used at a school site. Receipts from
subdividers' and developers' contributions can also be used for augmenting
capital replacement funds of the district as needed due to the increased
enrollment of students. If any improvement provided for herein shall require a
voter referendum approval under existing statutory authority before such funds
may be lawfully expended, then and in those cases such approval shall be first
obtained.
   (a)   Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved in
accordance with all applicable Village regulations for subdivisions that
otherwise would have been dedicated as school sites. It has been determined
that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the
Village is forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) per acre and such figure shall
be used in making any calculation herein unless changed by the Mayor and Board
of Trustees by a motion specifically referring to this subsection (A)2(a), or
unless a subdivider or a developer files a written objection thereto. In the
event of any objection, the fair market value of such improved land shall be
determined in the following manner:
      (1)   At the sole cost of the developer, the Village President and Board
of Trustees, the school district and the developer shall each name an appraiser
who shall make an appraisal of the fair market value of such acres of land on
behalf of the Village;
      (2)   All appraisers shall be MAI appraisers who shall issue bona fide
appraisals of the fair market value of the land in question; and
      (3)   The final determination of the fair market value shall be the
average of the two (2) appraisals which give the highest land value.
   (b)   Determining Contributions: Cash contributions per dwelling unit shall
be calculated by multiplying the present fair market value of improved land in
and surrounding the Village by the acres of land deemed needed to have
sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in
each school classification as calculated pursuant to subsection (A)1(a).
   (c)   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There will be situations
in subdivisions when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in
lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
      (1)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the school location shall be dedicated;
      (2)   A major part of a school site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in
lieu thereof shall be required.
      3.   Density Formula: The following table of population density is
generally indicative of current and short-range projected trends in family size
for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required
dedication of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu thereof unless a
written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer:

The school districts acting jointly shall submit to the Mayor and Board of
Trustees for their approval, not less than once every five (5) years, a revised
table of population density.
      4.   Subdivider's Alternative Demographic Study: In the event a
subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table of Estimated
Student Population Per Dwelling Unit listed in this Section, he shall submit
his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be
generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event,
final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculation shall
be made by the Village Board of Trustees based upon such demographic
information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources
which may be submitted to the Village Board of Trustees by the school district,
or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local
conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication
of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject
to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
      5.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the Comprehensive Plan of the
Village calls for a larger amount of school sites in a particular proposed
subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to
dedicate, the land needed beyond the subdivider's or developer's contribution
shall, if so determined by the Village Board of Trustees, be reserved for
subsequent purchase by the Village or other public body designated by the
Village provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of
approval of the final plat.
      6.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for school sites shall not differ greatly
from surrounding land.
      7.   Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready
for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets as applicable to the
location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefor. The sidewalks and
trees normally included within the definition of improved sites may be deleted
due to the delay time between dedication of any such school sites and
construction of school facilities thereon.
      8.   Title To Sites: All sites shall be conveyed either by warranty or
trustee's deed for the benefit of the affected school district and conveyed
directly to the School Trustees. The subdivider or developer shall be
responsible for conveying good, merchantable title to such sites, and shall be
responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance,
including any agricultural roll-back taxes which might be extended or levied
against such sites for any tax years or periods prior to the time of
conveyance.
      9.   Use Of Parcel: When, in the opinion of the school district holding
title to any parcel of land dedicated under this Section, any such parcel has
become unnecessary or unsuitable or inconvenient, such parcel may be sold as
provided by applicable statutory authority, and the proceeds shall be held in
trust by said unit of local government, solely for such uses as are provided
for in this Section, and said proceeds shall be subject to the ten (10) year
expenditure requirements from and after the date when said land is converted to
cash proceeds.
All dedications shall be made at the time of final plan approval and all cash
contributions required herein shall be made prior to the issuance of each
building permit by the Village.
If any provision of this Section, or the application thereof to any person or
circumstance, is declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
partial invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
Section which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application
thereof, and to this extent the provisions of this Section are declared to be
severable. (Ord. 720, 8-28-1995)

sump pump ejector lines installed or replaced in or under a lot that abuts a
storm sewer system shall discharge only directly into village approved
subterranean drain tile that is connected to the village storm sewer system.
All such ejector lines and drain tile shall be installed, connected and
maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of the Illinois plumbing
code. A violation of this provision shall be considered a business offense and
shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for
each day of noncompliance. In addition, any violation of this provision shall
authorize the denial of a certificate of occupancy until the sump pump
discharge connection complies herewith. (Ord. 970, 8-25-2003)
11-5-4: WATER SUPPLY:
   (A)   The subdivider shall provide the subdivision with a complete water
main supply system which shall be connected to the public water supply system,

be provided at each branch main connection and elsewhere as required to permit
adequate sectionalizing for maintenance purposes.
   (C)   Fire hydrants shall be installed throughout the entire subdivision
when served by a public water supply system. Water mains shall be not less than
six inches (6") in diameter, and shall include installation of shutoff valves
and fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed at intervals of not to
exceed three hundred feet (300'). All fire hydrants shall have a six inch (6")
barrel and shall be provided with two (2) 21/2-inch hose connections and one
steamer connection.
   (D)   Where installation of water mains of larger capacity than required to
serve only the subdivision as delineated in the preliminary plan, the
subdivider shall install the larger size main, but shall be required to pay for
only the proportionate benefit of the installation that directly serves his
subdivision, as established by the board of trustees. (Ord. 468, 11-8-1976)
11-5-5: HOUSE SERVICES:
   (A)   House services for sewer and water shall be constructed to connect
with the utility service mains constructed within any street to serve each
adjoining lot, tract or building site. Such house services shall extend from
the main to a point of at least eight feet (8') beyond the outside curb lines
of the proposed roadway pavement in the street.
   (B)   House water service for each single-family residence shall be a
minimum of one inch (1"), type K copper or approved equal and shall be

interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the
superintendent and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-6: PREDISCHARGE FACILITIES MAINTENANCE:
Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his expense. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-7: CONTROL MANHOLE:
Each new industry shall be required to install a control manhole and, when
required by the superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by an
existing building sewer carrying industrial or commercial wastes shall install
a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-8: WASTE SAMPLING:
The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial
wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of waters and
wastes to illustrate compliance with this chapter and any special conditions
for discharge established by the village or regulatory agencies having
jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the village, but no less than once per year the
industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the wastewater
discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state and local standards
are being met. The owner shall report the results of measurement and laboratory
analyses to the village at such time and in such manner as prescribed by the
village. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and
reporting required by the village. At such time as deemed necessary, the
village reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an
outside laboratory service. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-9: WASTE MEASUREMENTS:
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "IEPA Division Of Laboratories Manual Of
Laboratory Methods", and shall be determined at the control manhole provided,
or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-10: SAMPLING DEVICES:
Any person discharging wastes having concentrations greater than the "normal"
concentrations as set forth herein shall, upon notification by the approving
authority, install a composite sample with a compatible pacing (metering)
device for monitoring said substances. The pacing and sampling devices shall be
of a type approved by the superintendent. All testing and measuring procedures
for the analysis of pollutants shall be in conformance with title 40 CFR part
136.
The cost of all required measurements, tests and analyses shall be borne by the
contributor. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-8-11: SPECIAL AGREEMENT FOR SERVICE:
No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the village and any industrial concern
whereby any industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted
by the village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial
concern; provided, such payments are in accordance with federal and state
guidelines for a user charge system. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)

12-10-7:Accounting
12-10-1: BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The wastewater service charges for the use of and for service supplied by the
wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user charge to
pay expenses of operation, maintenance and replacement of the system; a fixed
debt service charge; and a variable debt service rate and a surcharge in
accordance with the sum of the charges developed from data outlined in the
report of Warren Associates, Northbrook, Illinois, dated January 1996, said
report being incorporated herein by reference.
   (A)   Basic User Charge:
      1.   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal volume
and concentrations:
         (a)   A five (5) day, twenty degree centigrade (20°C) biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l).
         (b)   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter (250 mg/l).
      2.   The basic user charge shall consist of operation and maintenance
costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund, for the next
fiscal year for all works categories.
         (b)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories
by volume, suspended solids and BOD5.
         (c)   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD5 to
be treated.
         (d)   Compute unit costs for volume (dollars per 1,000 gallons), for
suspended solids (dollars per pound) and BOD5 (dollars per pound).
         (e)   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for volume, SS
and BOD5 at normal sewage strength. Add these costs to determine the charge for
operation and maintenance including replacement.
   (B)   Basic User Rate: A basic user rate (OM&R) shall be applied to all
wastewater dischargers based upon metered water consumption to pay all costs of
operation, maintenance, replacement expenses, and debt service of the sewerage
system as follows:
   Four dollars forty-five cents ($4.45) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of
metered water. This basic user rate shall automatically and without further
action increase annually at the rate of an additional twenty-five cents ($0.25)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water metered commencing on March 1, 2022.
Like increases of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per thousand gallons of water
metered shall occur on March 1 of each year thereafter, unless modified by
action of the board of trustees.
   (C)   Debt Service Rate: A debt service rate consisting of a rate per one
thousand (1,000) gallons of usage shall be determined by dividing the balance
of the amount required to pay annual principal and interest requirements (after
deducting revenue received from the fixed debt service charge), by the total
number of gallons billed in the preceding fiscal year for sewer service.
   (D)   Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied upon all users whose wastes
exceed the normal concentrations for BOD two hundred milligrams per liter (200
mg/l), and suspended solids two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l).
The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or
sewage meters for all wastes which exceed these parameters.
The wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public
accountants to the village in their annual audit report. It shall be revised
periodically to reflect the change in debt service or a change in operation and
maintenance including replacement costs. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006; amd. Ord.
1342, 2-8-2021)
12-10-2: MEASUREMENTS OF FLOW:
The volume of flow used for computing user charges and surcharges shall be
metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of one thousand
(1,000) gallons.
   (A)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall, if directed by the superintendent, install and maintain, at his expense,
water meters of a type approved by the superintendent for the purpose of
determining the volume of water obtained from these sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled,
without the consent of the superintendent. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-10-3: RATES FOR SEWER SERVICE:
   (A)   Basic User Charge: A basic user charge per bimonthly period may be
applied to each single metered or multiple unit served. The basic user charge
may be referred to as a billing charge, based on the cost of billing and in
this event the basic user rate would be reduced.
   (B)   Basic User Rate: A basic user rate (OM&R) shall be applied to all
wastewater dischargers based upon metered water consumption to pay all costs of
operation, maintenance, replacement expenses, and debt service of the sewerage
system as follows:
   Five dollars ninety-one cents ($5.91) per one thousand (1,000) gallons of
metered water. This basic user rate shall automatically and without further
action increase annually at the rate of an additional twenty-five cents ($0.25)
per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water metered commencing on March 1, 2025.
Like increases of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per thousand gallons of water
metered shall occur on March 1 of each year thereafter, unless modified by
action of the board of trustees.
   (C)   Debt Service Charge: A debt service charge, consisting of a fixed
charge of ten dollars ($10.00) per bimonthly billing period, shall be
applicable to each single unit connected to the system for the purpose of
payment of a portion of the cost of the loan and/or bond obligations of the
village. For a multiple connection user and a special multiple connection user,
a debt service charge of ten dollars ($10.00) per bimonthly billing period
shall be applicable to each additional unit over the first unit served through
a single connection.
   (D)   Debt Service Rate: A portion of the basic user rate shall be applied
to debt service in the amount of fifty cents ($0.50), which shall be placed in
a special debt service account for the payment of any bond, loan, and/or debt
obligation for water and wastewater system improvements.
   (E)   Surcharge: A surcharge, in addition to the above charges, will be
levied upon all users whose discharges exceed the average concentrations for
BOD5 and suspended solids as follows:
      1.   For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)   $0.279/lb., BOD5
      2.   For suspended solids            0.146/lb., SS
      The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula:
         S = V (0.00834)(A [BOD5-200] + B [SS-250])
      Where
S         = Amount of surcharge in dollars
V         = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period
(0.00834) = Unit weight of water x 10-6 per thousand gallons
A         = Unit charge for BOD5 per lb.
BOD5      = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/I
200       = Allowable average BOD5 concentration, mg/I
B         = Unit charge for SS per lb.
SS        = Suspended solids, mg/I
250       = Allowable average SS concentration, mg/I
 
   (F)   Nonmetered Users: All nonmetered users of the wastewater facilities
shall pay a minimum flat rate charge per bimonthly period which shall be
adequate to cover the cost of operation, maintenance, replacement, and debt
service obligations of the system, as determined by application of the basic
user rate to allowable usage of seventeen thousand (17,000) gallons per
bimonthly period.
   (G)   Minimum Bimonthly Rates And Charges: Each account per single meter
shall pay a minimum amount equal to eight thousand (8,000) gallons of water
usage per bimonthly period and no credit shall be provided for any unused
sanitary sewer amount. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006; amd. Ord. 1409, 6-10-2024)
12-10-4: COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES:
The wastewater service charge for metered users shall be computed using the
following formula:
WC = V x (BUR + DSR + DSC) + S
Where
 
WC  = Amount of wastewater service charge in dollars per billing period.
V   = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period.
BUR = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement expense.
DSR = Debt service rate for the variable charge applicable to payment of debt
      obligations.
DSC = Debt service charge for the fixed charge applicable to payment of debt
      service.
S   = Amount of wastewater surcharge in dollars as computed by the surcharge
      formula.
 
(Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-10-5: ACCESS TO RECORDS:
The Illinois environmental protection agency or its authorized representative
shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the village
which are applicable to the village system of user charges for the purpose of
making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions thereof to ensure
compliance with the terms of the special and general conditions to any state
grant. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-10-6: APPEALS:

charges shall be made available to a user within seven (7) business days of
receipt of a written request for such. Any disagreement over the method used or
in the computation thereof shall be remedied by the sewer and water committee
within thirty (30) days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining
the discrepancies. The decision of the sewer and water committee shall be
final. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-10-7: ACCOUNTING:
The waterworks and sewerage fund is the principal accounting designation for
all revenues received and expenses incurred in the operation of the waterworks
and/or sewerage system. These revenues and expenses shall be accounted for so
that water system revenues and expenses shall be recorded separately in the
waterworks account of the fund and revenues and expenses of the sewerage system
shall be recorded separately in the sewerage account of the waterworks and
sewerage fund.
In addition to the customary operating statements, the annual audit report
shall also reflect the separate revenues and operating expenses of the
wastewater facilities, including a replacement cost, to indicate that sewer
service charges under the waste cost recovery system do in fact meet these
regulations. In this regard, the financial information to be shown in the audit
report shall include the following:
   (A)   Flow data showing total gallons received at the wastewater plant for
the current fiscal year.
   (B)   Billing data to show total number of thousand gallons billed.
   (C)   Debt service for the next succeeding fiscal year.
   (D)   Number of users connected to the system.

equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be
located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written
notice of violation from the village requiring that such locating be completed.
Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of
the drain or conveyance is to be determined, that the drain or conveyance be
identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall
location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer
system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations

that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-10: SUBMISSION OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO VILLAGE:
   (A)   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES

have an NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial
activity shall submit a copy of the notice of intent (NOI) to the village at
the same time the operator submits the original notice of intent to the
Illinois EPA as applicable.
   (C)   The copy of the notice of intent may be delivered to the village
either in person or by mailing it to:
   Notice Of Intent To Discharge Storm Water
   Village Of Beecher
   724 Penfield Street
   P.O. Box 1154
   Beecher, IL 60401
   (D)   A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is
discharging storm water associated with industrial activity without having
submitted a copy of the notice of intent to do so to the village. (Ord. 1053,
11-14-2006)
12-12-11: RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING:
The village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to
regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter.
   (A)   If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger
shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
village.
   (B)   Facility operators shall allow the village ready access to all parts

monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the village reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
(Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-12: SEARCH WARRANTS:
If the village has been refused access to any part of the premises from which
storm water is discharged and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health safety, and welfare of the community,
then the village may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of
competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-13: BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES:
The village will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the
United States. The owner or operator of such activity, operation, or facility
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and
nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises,
which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural
BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4. Compliance with
all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable,
shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs
shall be part of a storm water pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary
for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-14: SPILL NOTIFICATION:
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the village in
person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the village within three (3) business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least five (5)
years.
Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation
of this chapter. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-15: VIOLATIONS:
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. Any person who has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter may be subject to the
enforcement actions outlined in this section or may be restrained by injunction
or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.
In the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or
public safety, the village is authorized to enter upon the subject private
property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary
to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The village is authorized
to seek costs of the abatement as outlined in section
12-12-24 of this chapter. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-16: WARNING NOTICE:
When the village finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, or any order issued hereunder, the village may
serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular
violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to
immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any
offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter
in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the warning
notice. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the village to
take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action,
without first issuing a warning notice. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-17: NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Whenever the village finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed
to meet a requirement of this chapter, the village may order compliance by
written notice of violation to the responsible person.
   (A)   The notice of violation shall contain:
      1.   The name and address of the alleged violator;
      2.   The address when available or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring, or has occurred;
      3.   A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
      4.   A description of the remedial measures necessary to restore
compliance with this chapter and a time schedule for the completion of such
remedial action;
      5.   A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed;
      6.   A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to
the village by filing a written notice of appeal within ten (10) business days
of service of notice of violation; and
      7.   A statement specifying that, should the violator fail to restore
compliance within the established time schedule, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
   (B)   Such notice may require without limitation:
      1.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
      2.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
      3.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
      4.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
      5.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
      6.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. (Ord. 1053,
11-14-2006)
12-12-18: COMPENSATORY ACTION:
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this
chapter, the village may impose upon the violator alternative compensatory
actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops,
creek cleanup, and other appropriate compensatory actions. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-
2006)
12-12-19: SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS:
   (A)   Emergency Cease And Desist Orders: When the village finds that any
person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or
any order issued hereunder, or that the person's past violations are likely to
recur, and that the person's violations have caused or contributed to an actual
or threatened discharge to the MS4 or waters of the United States which
reasonably appears to present an imminent substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons or to the environment, the village may issue an
order to the violator directing it immediately to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the violator to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all ordinance requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Any person notified of an emergency order directed to it under this subsection
shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate its endangering discharge. In
the event of a discharger's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
emergency order, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize harm to the MS4 or waters of the United States, and/or endangerment
to persons or to the environment, including immediate termination of a
facility's water supply, sewer connection, or other municipal utility services.
The village may allow the person to recommence its discharge when it has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the village that the period of endangerment
has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the
discharger under this chapter. A person that is responsible, in whole or in
part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and
the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the village within five
(5) business days of receipt of the emergency order. Issuance of an emergency
cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the violator.
   (B)   Suspension Due To Illicit Discharges In Emergency Situations: The
village may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person
when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the village may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   (C)   Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge: Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
village will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the village for a reconsideration and hearing.
A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the village.
(Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-20: CIVIL PENALTIES:
In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth
in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described
therein within five (5) business days, or such greater period as the village
shall deem appropriate, after the village has taken one or more of the actions
described above, the village may impose a penalty of not to exceed seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) (depending on the severity of the violation)

subject to a criminal penalty of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more
than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per violation per day and/or
imprisonment for a period of time not to exceed six (6) months. Each act of
violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a
separate offense. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-22: APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION:
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the
village. The notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) business days
from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the
appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within twenty eight
(28) business days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The
decision of the municipal authority or their designee shall be final. (Ord.
1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-23: ENFORCEMENT:
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth
in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five (5)
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision
of the village, then representatives of the village shall enter upon the
subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon
the premises for the purposes set forth above. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-24: COST OF ABATEMENT:
Within twenty eight (28) business days after abatement of the violation, the
owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount of the assessment within ten (10) business days. If the amount
due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the
municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an
appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and
shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable
to the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not
more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of five percent (5%)
per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the thirtieth day
following discovery of the violation. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-25: PUBLIC NUISANCE:
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition
caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this
chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and
deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's
expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise, compel the
cessation of such nuisance may be taken. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-2006)
12-12-26: REMEDIES NOT EXCLUSIVE:
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the
discretion of the village to seek cumulative remedies. The village may recover
all attorney fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement
of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses. (Ord. 1053, 11-14-
2006)
