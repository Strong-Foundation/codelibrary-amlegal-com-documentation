by different clauses or sections of this code, the prosecuting officer may
elect under which to proceed but not more than one recovery shall be had
against the same person for the same offense provided, that the revocation of a
license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar
any other penalty being enforced.

constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code and there is no
fine or penalty specifically declared for such breach, the provisions of this
chapter shall apply.

Resources, to the fund established by the Department of Natural Resources for
the purpose of evidence for investigation purposes and to conduct
investigations as outlined in the Department of Natural Resources
(Conservation) Law;
      (14)    Refrain from entering into a designated geographic area except
upon such terms as the court finds appropriate. Such terms may include
consideration of the purpose of the entry, the time of day, other persons
accompanying the defendant, and advance approval by a probation officer;
      (15)    Refrain from having any contact, directly or indirectly, with
certain specified persons or particular types of person, including but not
limited to members of street gangs and drug users or dealers;
      (16)   Refrain from having in his or her body the presence of any illicit
drug prohibited by 720 ILCS 550/1 et seq., the Cannabis Control Act, 720 ILCS
570/100 et seq., the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or the Methamphetamine
Control and Community Protection Act, unless prescribed by a physician, and
submit samples of his or her blood or urine or both for tests to determine the
presence of any illicit drug.
      (17)   Refrain from operating any motor vehicle not equipped with an
ignition interlock device as defined in 625 ILCS 5/1-129.1, the Illinois
Vehicle Code. Under this condition the court may allow a defendant who is not
self-employed to operate a vehicle owned by the defendant's employer that is
not equipped with an ignition interlock device in the course and scope of the
defendant's employment.
      (18)   If placed on supervision for a sex offense as defined in 625 ILCS
5/3-1-2(a)(5), unless the offender is a parent of guardian of the person under
18 years of age present in the home and no non-familial minors are present, not

as distributing candy or other items to children on Halloween, wearing a Santa
Claus costume on or preceding Christmas, being employed as a department store
Santa Claus, or wearing an Easter Bunny costume on or preceding Easter.
   (C-5)   If payment of restitution as ordered has not been made, the victim
shall file a petition notifying the sentencing court, any other person to whom
restitution is owed, and the State's Attorney of the status of the ordered
restitution payments unpaid at least 90 days before the supervision expiration
date. If payment as ordered has not been made, the court shall hold a review
hearing prior to the expiration date, unless the hearing is voluntarily waived
by the defendant with the knowledge that waiver may result in an extension of
the supervision period or in a revocation of supervision. If the court does not
extend supervision, it shall issue a judgment for the unpaid restitution and
direct the clerk of the circuit court to file and enter the judgment in the
judgment and lien docket, without fee, unless it finds that the victim has
recovered a judgment against the defendant for the amount covered by the
restitution order. If the court issues a judgment for the unpaid restitution,
the court shall send to the defendant at his or her last known address written
notification that a civil judgment has been issued for the unpaid restitution.
   (D)   The court shall defer entering any judgment on the charges until the
conclusion of the supervision.
   (E)   At the conclusion of the period of supervision, if the court
determines that the defendant has successfully complied with all of the
conditions of supervision, the court shall discharge the defendant and enter a
judgment dismissing the charges.
   (F)   Discharge and dismissal upon a successful conclusion of a disposition
of supervision shall be deemed without adjudication of guilt and shall not be
termed a conviction for purposes of disqualification or disabilities imposed by
law upon conviction of the crime. Two years after the discharge and dismissal
under this section, unless the disposition of supervision was for a violation
of 625 ILCS 5/3-707, 3-708, 3-710, 5-401.3, 11-501, or 11-503 or a similar
provision of a local ordinance, or for a violation of 720 ILCS 5/12-3.2, in
which case it shall be five years alter discharge and dismissal, a person may
have his or her record of arrest sealed or expunged as may be provided by law.
However, any defendant placed on supervision before January 1, 1980, may move
for sealing or expungement of his or her arrest record, as provided by law, at
any time after discharge and dismissal under this section. A person placed on
supervision for a sexual offense committed against a minor as defined in 20
ILCS 2630/(5)(g) or for a violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-501 or a similar provision
of a local ordinance, the Criminal Identification Act, shall not have his or
her record of arrest sealed or expunged.
   (G)   A defendant placed on supervision and who during the period of
supervision undergoes mandatory drug or alcohol testing, or both, or is
assigned to be placed on an approved electronic monitoring device, may be
ordered to pay the costs incidental to such mandatory drug or alcohol testing,
or both, and costs incidental to such approved electronic monitoring in
accordance with the defendant's ability to pay those costs. The county board
with the concurrence of the Chief Judge of the judicial circuit in which the
county is located may establish reasonable fees for the cost of maintenance,
testing, and incidental expenses related to the mandatory drug or alcohol
testing, or both, and all costs incidental to approved electronic monitoring,
of all offenders placed on supervision. The concurrence of the Chief Judge
shall be in the form of an administrative order.
      (1)   The Chief Judge of the Circuit Court of the county may by
administrative order establish a program for electronic monitoring of
offenders, in which a vendor supplies and monitors the operation of the
electronic monitoring device, and collects the fees on behalf of the county.
the program shall include provisions for indigent offenders and the collection
of unpaid fees. The program shall not unduly burden the offender and shall be
subject to review by the Chief Judge.
      (2)   The Chief Judge of the Circuit Court may suspend any additional
charges or fees for late payment, interest, or damage to any device.
   (H)   A disposition of supervision is a final order for the purposes of
appeal.
   (I)   (1)   The court shall impose upon a defendant placed on supervision
after January 1, 1992, or to community service under the supervision of a
probation or court services department after January 1, 2004, as a condition of
supervision or supervised community service, a fee of $50 for each month of
supervision or supervised community service ordered by the court, unless after
determining the inability of the person placed on supervision or supervised
community service to pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser fee. The court
may not impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or custody
of the Department of Children and Family Services under the Juvenile Court Act
of 1987 while the minor is in placement. The fee shall be imposed only upon a
defendant who is actively supervised by the probation and court services
department. The fee shall be collected by the clerk of the circuit court. The
clerk of the circuit court shall pay all monies collected from this fee to the
county treasurer for deposit in the probation and court services fund pursuant
to 730 ILCS 110/15.1 of the Probation and Probation Officers Act.
      (2)   A circuit court may not impose a probation fee in excess of $25 per
month unless the circuit court has adopted, by administrative order issued by
the chief judge, a standard probation fee guide determining an offender's
ability to pay. Of the amount collected as a probation fee, not to exceed $5 of
that fee collected per month may be used to provide services to crime victims
and their families.
      (3)   The court may only waive probation fees based on an offender's
ability to pay. The probation department may re-evaluate an offender's ability
to pay every six months, and, with the approval of the Director of Court
Services or the Chief Probation Officer, adjust the monthly fee amount. An
offender may elect to pay probation fees in a lump sum. Any offender that has
been assigned to the supervision of the probation department, or has been
transferred either under division (H) of this section or under any interstate
compact, shall be required to pay probation fees to the department supervising
the offender, based on the offender's ability to pay.
   (J)   All fines and costs imposed under this section for any violation of
625 ILCS 5/3-100 et seq., 4-100 et seq., 6-100 et seq., and 11-100 et seq. of
the Illinois Vehicle Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and any
violation of 625 ILCS 25/1 et seq., the Child Passenger Protection Act, or a
similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be collected and disbursed by the
circuit clerk as provided under 705 ILCS 105/27.5 of the Clerks of Courts Act.

capacity of the defendant to make restitution as well as to determine the
amount and conditions of payment at the court's discretion.
      (2)   Restitution shall be made in an amount not to exceed the actual
out-of-pocket expenses or loss to the victim proximately caused by the conduct
of the defendant to be payable over a period not to exceed one year.
      (3)   Cash bond in excess of actual court costs may be used for
restitution.

during such additional period. The court shall retain all of the incidents of
the original sentence, including the authority to modify or enlarge the
conditions, and to revoke the sentence if the conditions of payment are
violated during such additional period.

(Ord. passed 2-1-82)
§ 35.02 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Policy. It is the policy of the city to invest public funds in a
manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum
security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city conforming to
all state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.
   (B)   Scope. This policy includes all funds governed by the City Council.
   (C)   Prudence. Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under
circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital, as well as the probable income to be derived. The standards of
prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the “prudent person”
standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio.
   (D)   Objective. The primary objective, in order of priority, shall be:
      (1)   Legality. Conformance with federal, state and other legal
requirements;
      (2)   Safety. Preservation of capital and protection of investment
principal;
      (3)   Liquidity. Maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet operating
requirements; and
      (4)   Yield. Attainment of market rates of return.
   The portfolio should be reviewed periodically as to its effectiveness in
meeting the city's needs for safety, liquidity, rate of return, diversification
and its general performance.
   (E)   Delegation of authority. Management and administrative responsibility
for the investment program is hereby delegated to the Investment Committee
which, under the delegation of the City Council, shall establish written
procedures for the operation of the investment program. The Investment
Committee shall be comprised of the Mayor, City Clerk and the City Treasurer.
   (F)   Ethics and Conflicts of interest. Officers an employees involved in
the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or
that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions.
   (G)   Authorized financial dealers and institutions. The Investment
Committee will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide
investment services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved
security brokers/dealers selected by credit worthiness.
   (H)   Authorized and suitable investments. Investments may be made in any
type of security allowed for in state statutes regarding the investment of
public funds. Investments shall be made that reflect the cash flow needs of the
fund type being invested.
   (I)   Collateralization. Funds on deposit (checking accounts, certificates
of deposit, etc.) in excess of FDIC limits must be secured by some form of
collateral, witnessed by a written agreement and held at an independent third
party institution in the name of the municipality.
   (J)   Safekeeping and custody. All security transactions, including
collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the city, shall be
conducted on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis. Securities will be held by
an independent third party custodian designated by the Investment Committee and
evidenced by safekeeping receipts and a written custodial agreement.
   (K)   Diversification. The city shall diversify its investments to the best
of its ability based on the type of funds invested and the cash flow needs of
those funds. Diversification can be by type of investment, number of
institutions invested in and length of maturity.
   (L)   Maximum maturities. To extent possible, the city shall attempt to
match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched
by a specific cash flow, the city will not directly invest in securities
maturing more than two years from the date of purchase. Reserve funds may be
invested in securities exceeding two years if the maturity of such investments
are made to coincide as nearly as practicable with expected use of funds.
   (M)   Internal control. The Investment Committee is responsible for
establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to insure
that the assets of the city are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The
internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable assurance
that these objectives are met. The internal controls shall address the
following points:
      (1)   Control of collusion;
      (2)   Separation of transaction authority from accounting;
      (3)   Custodial safekeeping; and
      (4)Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and
wire transfers.
   (N)   Performance standards. This investment portfolio will be managed in
accordance with the parameters specified within this policy. The portfolio
should obtain a comparable rate of return during a market/economic environment
of stable interest rates. Portfolio performance should be compared to

delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be
assessed equal to 25% of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period

ordinance.

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (C)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four-year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the city,

be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in which return for the

the applicable period was filed.

§ 35.29 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of any audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application but not more then four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request to the City
Clerk's office.

regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a

shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

§ 37.19 PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF IDENTITY THEFT.
   (A)   In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in
restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered
account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with
respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her
discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags
suggest a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee
determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or
probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the City
Clerk. If, in his or her discretion, the City Clerk deems that identity theft
is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags,
the City Clerk shall convey this information to the Mayor, who may in his or
her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the Mayor, in
his or her discretion, determines that no further action is necessary, a city
employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to
be appropriate by the Mayor:
      (1)   Contact the customer;
      (2)   Make the following changes to the account if, after contacting the
customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the
customer’s covered account:

security devices that permit access to an account; or
         (b)   Close the account;
      (3)   Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer;
      (4)   Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the
customer has accessed the customer’s account causing additional charges to
accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or
      (5)   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity
theft.
   (B)   In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in
opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible
identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such employee
shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or
combination of red flags suggest that identity theft or attempted identity
theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red
flags to the City Clerk. If, in his or her discretion, the City Clerk deems
that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
reconcile red flags, the City Clerk shall convey this information to the Mayor,
who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary.
If the Mayor, in his or her discretion determines that further action is
necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following
responses, as determined to be appropriate by the Mayor:
      (1)   Request additional identifying information from the applicant;
      (2)   Deny the application for the new account;
      (3)   Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or
      (4)   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity
theft.

implementation. The City Clerk is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by
staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with recommending
material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the City Clerk,
to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued
types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the program
shall be submitted to the City Council for consideration by the Council.
   (A)   The City Clerk will report to the Mayor at least annually on
compliance with the red flag requirements.
   (B)   The City Clerk and Mayor are responsible for providing training to all

discretion in determining the amount and substance of training necessary.
(Ord. 09-09, passed 4-20-09)
§ 37.22 OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS.

in connection with one or more covered accounts, the City Clerk shall exercise
his or her discretion in reviewing such arrangements in order to ensure, to the
best of his or her ability, that the service provider’s activities are
conducted in accordance with policies and procedures, agreed upon by contract,
that are designed to detect any red flags that may arise in the performance of
the service provider’s activities and take appropriate steps to prevent or
mitigate identity theft.

identity in accordance with the requirements of the Customer Information
Program rules implementing 31 U.S.C. § 5318(l);
      (2)   Information the city maintains in its own records, such as
applications for service, change of address notices, other customer account
records or tax records; or
      (3)   Information the city obtains from third-party sources that are
deemed reliable by the relevant city employee; or
   (B)   Verify the information in the consumer report with the consumer.
(Ord. 09-09, passed 4-20-09)

agency in the future and the city reasonably confirms that an address provided
by a consumer to the city is accurate, the city is required to provide such
address to the consumer reporting agency from which the city received a notice
of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information is
required to be provided to the consumer reporting agency when:

report relates to the consumer about whom the city requested the report;
      (2)   The city establishes a continuing relation with the consumer; and
      (3)   The city regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides
information to the consumer reporting agency from which it received the notice

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.100 BASIC DATA FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The user charge system and hereinafter set forth has been developed from
data outlined in the report of Willett, Hofmann and Associates, Inc., dated
August, 1976, entitled “Sewer User Charge System for Treatment of Municipal and
Industrial Wastes,” this report being incorporated herein by reference and
which shall constitute the basis for determining industrial and domestic user
charges.
('72 Code, § 51.060) (Ord. 51-A, passed 10-4-76)
Penalty, see § 51.999
§ 51.101 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charges for the use of and for services
supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user
charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge
and a surcharge, if applicable.
   (B)   The debt service charge shall have a fixed charge component and a
usage charge component. The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing
40% of the total annual debt service of all outstanding revenue bonds by the
number of users. Through further divisions, the monthly and quarterly debt
service fixed charges can be computed. The debt service usage charge shall be
computed by dividing 60% of the total annual debt service of all outstanding
revenue bonds by the total annual metered volume on a cost per 100 cubic feet
basis.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters and sewage meters for wastes having the following normal volume
and concentrations:
      (1)   Flow of 150,000 cubic feet per quarterly period.
      (2)   A five day, 20°C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l.
      (3)   A suspended solids content of 240 mg/l.
   (D)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement
and shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund, for the next
fiscal year for all works categories.
      (2)   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by
volume, suspended solids, BOD5.
      (3)   Estimate waterworks volume, pounds of SS, and pounds of BOD5 to be
treated.
      (4)   Compute unit costs for volume (dollars per HCF) for SS (dollars per
pound) and for BOD5 (dollars per pound.).
      (5)   Compute costs per HDF for volume, SS, and BOD5 at normal sewage
strength. Add these costs to determine the charge for operation and maintenance
including replacement.
   (E)   A surcharge will be levied upon all users whose wastes exceed the
normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l) and for volume
(150,000 cubic feet quarterly). The surcharge will be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200
mg/l, 240 mg/l concentrations for BOD, and SS content respectively. Section
51.106 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
   (F)   The wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified
public accountants to the city in their annual audit report. It shall be
revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in
operation and maintenance including replacement costs.

   Computation of surcharge, see §
51.106
§ 51.102 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   (A)   The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and
surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even
increments of 100 cubic feet.
   (B)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his or her water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall install and maintain, at his or her expense, water meters of a type
approved by the Operator for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
   (C)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the Operator if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records.
   (D)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, the meters may not be removed without the consent of the
Operator.
('72 Code, § 51.062) (Ord. 51-A, passed 10-4-76; Am. Ord. 19-03, passed 5-6-19)
§ 51.103 DEBT SERVICE CHARGE.
   (A)   A minimum debt service charge of $17.00 per month shall be applied to
all single metered users. The minimum charge shall allow the use of 165 cubic
feet per month, as measured by the water meter.
   (B)   A debt service rate charge of $4.50 per 100 cubic feet in excess of
the first 165 cubic feet per month shall be applied to all single metered users
of the sewer service. The meter reading shall be to the nearest cubic foot of
water used.
   (C)   A minimum debt service charge of $17.00 shall be applied to each unit
in a multiple unit user which is served through a single meter. By way of
example, the calculation for the minimum charge for a four-unit apartment
building is as follows: $17.00/unit x 4 units = $68.00.
   (D)   (1)   A debt service rate charge of $4.50 per 100 cubic feet shall be
applied to all usage in excess of 165 cubic feet per unit in a multiple unit
user per month. The meter reading shall be to the nearest cubic foot of water
used. The usage in excess of 165 cubic feet per unit is calculated as follows
for a four-unit apartment building:
      [Usage in cubic feet - (165 cubic feet/unit x 4 units)] x $4.50/100 cubic
feet
      (2)   If the month’s usage is less than the 165 cubic feet per unit then
only the minimum debt service charge shall apply.
   (E)   For a definition of “multiple unit user,” see §
52.090.
   (F)   The multiple unit user status shall only be permitted for existing
circumstances and nothing herein shall be construed to permit future multiple
unit user situations.

§ 51.104 BASIC USER RATE.
   There is established a minimum charge and a basic user rate for the use of
and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city to be applied
separately to single metered or multiple unit premises served:
   (A)   A minimum charge of $8.05 per month shall be applied to all single
metered users. The minimum charge shall allow the use of 165 cubic feet per
month, as measured by the water meter.
   (B)   A basic user rate of $2.15 per 100 cubic feet in excess of the first
165 cubic feet per month shall be applied to all single metered users of the
sewer service. The meter reading shall be to the nearest cubic foot of water
used.
   (C)   A minimum charge of $8.05 shall be applied to each unit in a multiple
unit user which is served through a single meter. The minimum charge shall
allow the use of 165 cubic feet per unit per month. For example, the
calculation for the minimum charge for a four-unit apartment building is as
follows: $8.05/unit x 4 units = $32.20.
   (D)   (1)   All usage in excess of 165 cubic feet per unit in a multiple
unit user per month as measured by the water meter shall be billed at the rate
of $2.15 per 100 cubic feet. The meter reading shall be to the nearest cubic
foot of water used. For example, the usage in excess of 165 cubic feet per unit
is calculated as follows for a four-unit apartment building:
      [Usage in cubic feet - (165 cubic feet/unit x 4 units)] x $2.15/100 cubic
feet.
      (2)   If the month’s usage is less than 165 feet per unit then only the
minimum charge shall apply.
   (E)   All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities shall
pay a minimum flat monthly charge of $58.30 to cover the cost of the minimum
debt service charge, debt service rate charge of $4.50 per 100 cubic feet, the
minimum service charge and the basic user rate of $2.15 per 100 cubic feet. The
flat rate charge shall allow a maximum of 665 cubic feet as follows:
      (1)   Minimum debt service charge         $17.00 per month;
      (2)   Debt service to 665 cubic feet at
         $4.50 per 100 cubic feet
         over minimum allowance of
         165 cubic feet per month         $22.50 per month;
      (3)   Minimum basic service charge      $8.05 per month;
      (4)   Basic service to 665 cubic feet
         at $2.15 per 100 cubic feet over
         minimum allowance of 165 cubic
         feet per month               $10.75 per month;
      (5)   Total flat rate               $58,30 per month.
   (F)   Commencing on October 1, 2015, and continuing until May 1, 2025, the
basic user rate shall be increased annually by $0.50 in the following manner:
                                                       Minimum Flat Monthly
       Minimum Charge for 165 Basic User Rate per 100  Charge for Non-Metered

within five days after the hearing, shall issue its written decision. This
decision shall be final and binding on the city and on the customer.
      (3)   Utilization of this dispute procedure shall not relieve a customer
of his or her obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed
sanitary sewer charges, and the undisputed portions of the amounts which are
subject of the present dispute. Notwithstanding §
51.109, failure to timely and completely pay all such undisputed amounts shall
subject the customer to termination of sanitary sewer service in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Until the date of the Water Board or the city official's decision,
whichever is later, the city shall not terminate the water, sanitary sewer or
garbage service of this customer and shall not issue a notice of termination to
him/her solely for nonpayment of the disputed amounts. If it is determined that

fee shall be assessed to the account for disconnection and re-connection at 8:
00 a.m. on the day disconnection is scheduled, in addition to all amounts due
on said account, payable in advance either by the customer or the owner of the
property before the sanitary sewer and water services to the premises are
turned back on.
         (d)   If the owner/customer pays all fees, deposits and delinquent
charges after 3:00 p.m. on a regular city business day and requests that
sanitary sewer and water services to the premises to be turned back on after 3:
00 p.m. on that day, or requests that the services be turned back on during a
time period which results in the city employee earning overtime compensation,
the owner/customer shall pay a $75 fee prior to the services being turned back
on.
         (e)   Disconnection fees shall be set from time to time by resolution
of the Polo City Council.
   (E)   Collection of delinquent charges.
      (1)   All user charges levied under the provisions of this chapter shall
be liens upon the real estate upon or to which sanitary sewer and water
services are supplied, as provided by law; however, such liens shall not attach
to such real estate until such charges have become delinquent. For the purposes
of this section, a charge shall be determined delinquent if it has not been
paid in full prior to the due date of the next month’s bill for the subject
property. The city shall send to the owner(s) of record of the real estate, as
referenced in the most recent information in the City Clerk’s records, a copy
of the delinquency notice which was sent to the person who is delinquent in
paying the charges. The notice shall inform the owner(s) that the unpaid
charges create a lien on the subject real estate. The City Clerk is authorized
and is directed to file a notice of lien in the Office of the Ogle County Clerk
and Recorder. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out the
following:
         (a)   A description of the real estate sufficient for identification
thereof;
         (b)   The amount of money due for such services; and
         (c)   The date when such amount became delinquent.
      (2)   In addition to any other method of collection as herein provided or
as is provided by law, the city shall also have the power and authority to sue
the occupant or user of the subject real estate in a civil action to recover
money due for sanitary sewer and water services, plus costs including
reasonable attorney’s fees to be fixed by the court.
      (3)   Judgments obtained by the city shall bear interest as provided by
statute(s) on the unpaid balance of said judgment(s).
      (4)   The city may also require reimbursement from the owner/occupant for
the fee to record the lien in the Recorder’s Office. After the charges
referenced in the lien have been paid in full along with interest and the
recording fee, the city will send a release of lien to the owner of the subject
real estate who then may record the lien at his, her, their or its expense.
      (5)   Any monthly bill which has not been paid in full by the due date
for that month’s bill shall be assessed an additional service charge equal to
10% of the delinquent bill.
      (6)   If a customer disputes the amount of the sanitary sewer and water
bill charged to him or her or them, or questions the accuracy of the meter for
which data for computing the bill was obtained, then the city will, at the
written request of the customer, cause tests and examinations of the meter to
be made to determine its accuracy. If it is found as a result of such test that
the meter registers a greater or lesser amount of water than is actually
passing through it in excess of the allowable variation of 2%, the Operator of
the Waterworks and Sewerage System Department shall have the authority to
adjust the error either positively or negatively so that the water charge to
the customer shall be that computed for the amount of water that actually
passed through such meter. Such adjustment shall not be retroactive for more
than two months.
   (F)   Turn on after disconnection. Any person who shall turn on or cause to
be turned on the supply of water to any premises from which the supply of water
has been turned off by order of the city on account of nonpayment of sanitary
sewer and water charges without having received permission so to do, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor as provided by statute. Each and every day for which
the water is turned on without permission from the city after it has been
turned off shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
   (G)   Administration and processing of accounts. City officials may
promulgate administrative rules and regulations to address day-to-day issues,
as the may arise, regarding the collection, service termination and
delinquencies of sanitary sewer and water billing accounts, so long as they are
not inconsistent with an provision adopted herein.
   (H)   Penalty.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided herein, any person violating any of
the provisions of this section shall be subject to termination of sanitary
sewer and water services and incur the penalty as provided in §
10.99 of this code for each violation. A new and separate violation shall be
deemed to have occurred for each day that a violation exists. In the event that
the city pursues any legal action, regardless of its nature, for the
enforcement of this section or any other applicable ordinances, the owner and
or occupant shall be liable for all costs, including reasonable attorney’s
fees, incurred by the city in taking such action. Even though a court has
determined that a violation of this section has occurred and has assessed a
fine or penalty as a result thereof, the city shall be authorized to seek
recovery of any unpaid charges and fees or other sums due the city under this
section or other ordinances because of the furnishing of its sanitary sewer and
water services.
      (2)   The remedies and penalties provided in this section shall not be
exclusive of any other remedy.

§ 52.065 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPROVED. Accepted by the operator of the waterworks and sewerage system
department as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this
subchapter, or as suitable for the proposed use.
   AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY. Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary
waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or
any natural source such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, or USED
WATERS or INDUSTRIAL FLUIDS. These waters may be polluted or contaminated or
they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over
which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control.
   BACKFLOW. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances under
pressure into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any
source or sources other than its intended source.
   BACKFLOW PREVENTER. A device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-
siphonage.
      (1)    AIR-GAP. The unobstructed vertical distance through the free
atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water
to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the
vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply
pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel; and, in no
case less than one inch. When an air-gap is used at the service connection to
prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable water system, an
emergency by-pass shall be installed around the air-gap system and an approved
reduced pressure principle device shall be installed in the by-pass system.
      (2)    DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY. An assembly of two independently
operating approved check valves with tightly closing shutoff valves on each
side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of
each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance
specifications and approval of a recognized and city-approved testing agency
for backflow prevention devices. To be approved these devices must be readily
accessible for in-line maintenance and testing.
      (3)    REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE DEVICE. An assembly of two
independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating
differential relief valve between the two check valves, tightly closing shutoff
valves on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for
the testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the
design and performance specification and approval of a recognized and city-
approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall
operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at a
level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At
cessation of normal flow the pressure on the public water supply side of the
device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves the differential
relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between
the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is
two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the
atmosphere. To be approved these devices must be readily accessible for the in-
line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of
the device will be submerged.
   BACK-SIPHONAGE. The flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances
into the distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source
other than its intended source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in
the potable water supply system.
   CONTAMINATION. An impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage,
industrial fluids, waste liquids, compounds, or other materials to a degree
which creates an actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or
through the spread of disease.
   CROSS-CONNECTION. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or
fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains
potable water and the other non-potable water or industrial fluids of
questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow or back-
siphonage may occur into the potable water system. A water service connection
between a public potable water distribution system and a customer's water
distribution system which is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture,
industrial fluid system, or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary
water system, constitutes one type of cross-connection. Other types of cross-
connections include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections,
four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or change-over
devices, sliding multiport tube, solid connections, and others.
      (1)    CONTROLLED CROSS-CONNECTION. A connection between a potable water
system and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention
device properly installed that will continuously afford the protection
commensurate with a degree of hazard.
      (2)    CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL BY CONTAINMENT. The installation of an
approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any
customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find
and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections
within the customer's water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an
approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and
supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or
potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or
controlled at the point of cross-connection.
   HAZARD.
      (1)    DEGREE OF. The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential
risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable
water system.
      (2)    HEALTH HAZARD. Any condition, device, or practice in the water
supply system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the
Operator of Water, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the
water consumer. An example of a health hazard is a structural defect, including
cross-connections, in a water supply system.
      (3)    PLUMBING HAZARD. A plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer's
potable water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker,
air-gap separation, or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing type
cross-connections are considered to be a health hazard.
      (4)    POLLUTION HAZARD. An actual or potential threat to the physical
properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the
consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be
aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its
appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
      (5)    SYSTEM HAZARD. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to
the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's
potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a
protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system.

solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other
purposes or for fire-fighting purposes.
   MULTIPLE UNIT USER. Residential, commercial or combination commercial and
residential buildings that have more than one unit located on the same premises
and are being served through a single water meter (such as apartment buildings,
trailer courts and commercial and residential units located within the same
building). A unit means a place of business or living accommodations for one
family. MULTIPLE UNIT USER does not include nursing homes, assisted living
facilities or schools.
   NON-POTABLE WATER. Water which is not safe for human consumption or which is
of questionable potability.
   OPERATOR. The Operator of the Waterworks and Sewerage System Department or
his or her authorized deputy, agent or representative as designated by the

RATES AND CHARGES; BILLING PROCEDURES
§ 52.090 WATER SERVICE RATES.
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      MULTIPLE UNIT USER. Residential, commercial or combination commercial and
residential buildings that have more than one unit located on the same premises
and are being served through a single water meter (e.g., apartment buildings,
trailer courts, and commercial and residential units located within the same
building). MULTIPLE UNIT USER does not include nursing homes, assisted living
facilities or schools.
      UNIT. A place of business or living accommodations for one family.
   (B)   Water rates per month within the corporate boundaries:
      (1)   For all single meter users of the waterworks system, the following
water rates shall apply:
         (a)   A flat minimum rate of $16.00 per meter for each monthly period,
this flat rate entitling each meter user to 165 cubic feet of water per monthly
period. A flat rate monthly charge for non-metered users is $33.50 per month
for residential or domestic use only and is calculated based on a usage of 665
cubic feet per month.
         (b)   For water used each monthly period in excess of 165 cubic feet,
meter users shall pay an additional $3.50 for each 100 cubic feet of water
used. The meter reading shall be to the nearest cubic foot of water used.
      (2)   For each multiple unit user of the waterworks system being served
through a single meter, the following water rates shall apply:
         (a)   A flat minimum rate of $16.00 per month shall be applied to each
unit in a multiple unit user served through a single meter. By way of example,
the calculation for the minimum charge for a four-unit apartment building is as
follows: ($16.00/unit)(four units) = $64.00.
         (b)   1.   For water used each monthly period in excess of 165 cubic
feet per unit in a multiple unit use, meter users shall pay an additional $3.50
for each 100 cubic feet of water used. The meter reading shall be to the
nearest cubic foot of water used. By way of example, the usage in excess of 165
cubic feet per unit is calculated as follows for a four-unit apartment building
with a single water meter: [Usage in cubic feet - (165 cubic feet/unit)(four
units)] x $3.50/100 cubic feet.
            2.   If the month’s usage does not exceed 165 cubic feet per unit,
only the flat minimum rate shall apply.
            3.   The multiple unit user status shall only be permitted for
existing circumstances and nothing herein shall be construed to permit future
multiple unit user situations. (See §
52.045).
   (C)   Water rates outside the corporate limits. Each user of the water
service of the city located outside the corporate limits shall have 50% added
to the bill for the type of service as set out above.
   (D)   Water hookup and usage rates for water purchased in bulk. A hookup fee
of $25 per day, or $50 per calendar year shall be charged. Also, and in
addition to the hookup fee, there shall be charged a usage fee of $6.00 per 100
cubic feet of water.

            2.   The amount of money due for such services; and
            3.   The date when such amount became delinquent.
         (b)   In addition to any other method of collection as herein provided
or as is provided by law, the city shall also have the power and authority to
sue the occupant or user of the subject real estate in a civil action to
recover money due for sanitary sewer and water services, plus costs including
reasonable attorney’s fees to be fixed by the court.
         (c)   Judgments obtained by the city shall bear interest as provided
by statute(s) on the unpaid balance of said judgment(s).
         (d)   The city may also require reimbursement from the owner/occupant
for the fee to record the lien in the Recorder’s Office. After the charges
referenced in the lien have been paid in full along with interest and the
recording fee, the city will send a release of lien to the owner of the subject
real estate who then may record the lien at his, her, their or its expense.
         (e)   Any monthly bill which has not been paid in full by the due date
for that month’s bill shall be assessed an additional service charge equal to
10% of the delinquent bill.
         (f)   If a customer disputes the amount of the sanitary sewer and
water bill charged to him, her or them, or questions the accuracy of the meter
for which data for computing the bill was obtained, then the city will, at the
written request of the customer, cause tests and examinations of the meter to
be made to determine its accuracy. If it is found as a result of such test that
the meter registers a greater or lesser amount of water than is actually passes
through it in excess of the allowable variation of 2%, the Operator of the
Waterworks and Sewerage System Department shall have the authority to adjust
the error either positively or negatively so that the water charge to the
customer shall be that computed for the amount of water that actually passed
through such meter. Such adjustment shall not be retroactive for more than two
months.
      (6)   Turn on after disconnection. Any person who shall turn on or cause
to be turned on the supply of water to any premises from which the supply of
water has been turned off by order of the city on account of nonpayment of
sanitary sewer and water charges without having received permission so to do,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor as provided by statute. Each and every day for
which the water is turned on without permission from the city after it has been
turned off shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
      (7)   Administration and processing of accounts. City officials may
promulgate administrative rules and regulations to address day-to-day issues,
as the may arise, regarding the collection, service termination and
delinquencies of sanitary sewer and water billing accounts, so long as they are
not inconsistent with any provision adopted herein.
      (8)   Limitations on Termination of Water Service.
         (a)   The city shall terminate water service for nonpayment of water
charges only during the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through
Thursday. No termination shall be permitted on a legal holiday or on the day
before a legal holiday.
         (b)   The city shall not terminate water service for nonpayment of
amounts less than $20, for the combined water, sanitary sewer and garbage bill.
      (9)   Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed by
this chapter, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of
time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so
computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or legal holiday,
in which event the period runs until the next day which is not a Saturday, a
Sunday or a legal holiday. When the period of time prescribed is less than
seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be
excluded in the computation.
   (B) Reconnection. Before any utility disconnected because of non-payment
shall be reconnected, all unpaid charges incurred as a result of past usage
shall be paid by the person or entity responsible for such payment under the
city ordinances, or such charges incurred as the result of utility usage at a
specific location.
   (C)   (1)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall
be subject to termination of sanitary sewer and water services and incur the
penalty as provided in §
10.99 of this code for each violation. A new and separate violation shall be
deemed to have occurred for each day that a violation exists. In the event that
the city pursues any legal action, regardless of its nature, for the
enforcement of this section or any other applicable ordinances, the owner and
or occupant shall be liable for all costs, including reasonable attorney’s
fees, incurred by the city in taking such action. Even though a court has
determined that a violation of this section has occurred and has assessed a
fine or penalty as a result thereof, the city shall be authorized to seek
recovery of any unpaid charges and fees or other sums due the city under this
section or other ordinances because of the furnishing of its sanitary sewer and
water services.
      (2)   The remedies and penalties provided in this section shall not be
exclusive of any other remedy.

service that has been provided. The city reserves the right to be reimbursed
for any associated costs for filing any claim due to nonpayment or delinquent
payment. This includes, but is not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees,

not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect

the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the
department at its discretion.

use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER. A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as
authorized by the Article.
   TELECOMMUNICATIONS. In addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly
ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any

in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a
telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service
provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or
terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right
of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all
telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component
of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-
taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not
be considered TELECOMMUNICATIONS subject to the tax imposed under this Act. For
purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that
term as defined in Section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act.
(Ord. 02-10, passed 8-5-02)
§ 54.02 SIMPLIFIED MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS TAX IMPOSED.
   A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:
   (A)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 6%
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer.
   (B)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving
in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of 6%
of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that
is subject to taxation under this division, any taxpayer, upon proof that the
taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the
extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state
which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local
tax in this state.
   (C)   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
(Ord. 02-10, passed 8-5-02)
§ 54.03 COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS.
   (A)   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the
taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall
be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be
collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall
constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
department in the manner provided by the department.
   (B)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications.
(Ord. 02-10, passed 8-5-02)
§ 54.04 RETURNS TO DEPARTMENT.
   Commencing on February 1, 2003, the tax imposed under this chapter on
telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, Section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement this
Act.
(Ord. 02-10, passed 8-5-02)
§ 54.05 RESELLERS.
   (A)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or
in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left,
shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by the arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal, as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (B)   Steady yellow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in §
70.32, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway
before a red indication is shown, and no pedestrian shall then start to cross
the roadway.
   (B-5)   Flashing yellow arrow indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow indication may
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians
lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow arrow indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in 625 ILCS 5/11-
307, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk
that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic
controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
   (C)   Steady red indication.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication to proceed is shown.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (C)(3) and (C)(4) of this section,
vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the
intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering
the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at
a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such
crosswalk, then before entering the intersection; and shall remain standing
until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
shown.
      (3)   Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn and the city
authorities by ordinance or state authorities by rule or regulation prohibit
any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously
enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street
into a one-way street, after stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2)
of this section. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any
vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to
constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or
within the intersection or junction or roadways. The driver shall yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
      (4)   After stopping as required by division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this
section, the driver or a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal
which fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not
less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction of because the signal has
failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle’s
size or weight, shall have the right to proceed, after yielding the right of
way to oncoming traffic facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable
after making a stop at a stop sign as required by §
70.41.
      (5)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in §
70.32, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall
not enter the roadway.
   (D)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made; or, in the absence of
such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

   (A)   “Walk” or walking person symbol. Pedestrians facing this signal may
proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal, and shall be given
the right-of-way by the drivers of all vehicles.
   (B)   “Don't Walk” or upraised palm signal. No pedestrian shall start to
cross the roadway in the direction of this signal, but any pedestrian who has
partly completed his crossing on the “Walk” signal or upraised palm symbol

Penalty, see § 70.99
§ 70.33 LANE-CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever lane-control signals are used in conjunction with official signs,

permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal is located.
Otherwise, he shall obey all other traffic controls present and follow normal
safe driving practices.

lane over which the signal is located, and this indication shall modify
accordingly the meaning of all other traffic controls present. Otherwise he
shall obey all other traffic controls, and follow normal safe driving
practices.
   (C)   Yellow X (steady). A driver facing this indication should prepare to
vacate the lane over which the signal is located, in a safe manner to avoid, if
possible, occupying that lane when a steady red X is displayed.

intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection, or if none, then at a point nearest the intersecting roadway
where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway
before entering the intersection, and the right to proceed shall be subject to
the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated

which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic
conditions and the use of the highway, or which endangers the safety of any

applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to
decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching

SPECIAL STOPS REQUIRED
§ 71.080 OBEDIENCE TO SIGNAL INDICATING APPROACH OF TRAIN OR RAILROAD TRACK
EQUIPMENT.
   (A)   Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade
crossing, that person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a
railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the
circumstances stated in this section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but
not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad, and shall not
proceed until he can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
      (1)   A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal device gives
warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (2)   A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman gives or continues to
give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track
equipment;
      (3)   A railroad train or railroad track equipment approaching a highway
crossing emits a warning signal and the railroad train or railroad track
equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to the crossing, is an immediate
hazard;
      (4)   An approaching railroad train or railroad track equipment is
plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing;
      (5)   A railroad train is or railroad track equipment approaching so
closely that an immediate hazard is created.

   (D)   At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs,
without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a
human flagger giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad
track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad
crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for
the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly
marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15
feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or
she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad
crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment
after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference
is prima facie evidence of the driver’s failure to yield right-of-way.

whom the disability license plate or parking decal or device was issued is
deceased and (b) the driver uses the disability license plate or parking decal
or device to exercise any of the privileges granted through a disability
license plate or parking decal or device under state law.

provided in division (G).
      (2)   If the, person is a first offender as defined in 625 ILCS 5/11-500,
and is not convicted of a violation of § 76.20, then reports received by the
Secretary of State under this section shall, except during the actual time the
statutory summary suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for
use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities or the
Secretary of State, unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a
commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous
materials, in which case the suspension shall not be privileged. Reports
received by the Secretary of State under this section shall also be made
available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years that
holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver’s license, regardless of
whether the statutory summary suspension is in effect. A statutory summary
revocation shall not be privileged information.
   (F)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under division
(D) shall serve immediate notice of the statutory summary suspension or
revocation on the person and the suspension or revocation and disqualification
shall be effective as provided in division (G). In cases where the blood
alcohol concentration of 0.08 or greater or any amount of a drug, substance, or
compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as covered
by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois
Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of
Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine
Control and Community Protection Act is established by a subsequent analysis of
blood or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer or
arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this section or by deposit in
the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and
addressed to the person at his or her address as shown of the Uniform Traffic
Ticket and the statutory summary suspension and disqualification shall begin as
provided in division (G). The officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver’s
license or permit on the person at the time of arrest. If the person has a
valid driver’s license or permit, the officer shall issue the person a receipt,
in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that will allow that person to
drive during the periods provided for in division (G). The officer shall
immediately forward the driver’s license or permit to the circuit court of
venue along with the sworn report provided in division (D).
   (G)   The statutory summary suspension or revocation and disqualification
referred to in this section shall take effect on the 46th day following the
date the notice of the statutory summary suspension or revocation was given to
the person.
   (H)   The following procedure shall apply whenever a person is arrested for
any offense as defined in §
76.20: Upon receipt of the sworn report from the law enforcement officer, the
Secretary of State shall confirm the statutory summary suspension or revocation
by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension or revocation to
the person and the court of venue. The Secretary of State shall also mail
notice of the effective date of the disqualification to the person. However,
should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information
or be completed in error, the confirmation of the statutory summary suspension
or revocation shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the record;
instead the sworn report shall be forwarded to the court of venue with a copy
returned to the issuing agency identifying any defect.
   (I)   As used in this section, PERSONAL INJURY includes any Type A injury as
indicated on the traffic accident report completed by a law enforcement officer
that requires immediate professional attention either in a doctor's office or a
medical facility. A Type A injury includes severely bleeding wounds, distorted
extremities, and injuries that require the injured party to be carried from the
scene.

§ 76.22 CHEMICAL AND OTHER TESTS.
   (A)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of an arrest for an offense as defined in §
76.20 or proceedings pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/2-118.1, evidence of the
concentration of alcohol, other drug or combination thereof in a person's blood
or breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the person's blood,
urine, breath or other bodily substance, shall be admissible. Where such test
is made the following provisions shall apply:
      (1)   Chemical analyses of the person’s blood, urine, breath or other
bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this section
shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Department
of State Police by a licensed physician, registered nurse, trained
phlebotomist, certified paramedic, or other individual possessing a valid
permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of State Police
is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the
qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to issue
permits which shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion
of that Department and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The
Department of State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary to
implement this section.
      (2)   (a)   When a person in this city shall submit to a blood test at
the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of §
76.21, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a registered nurse,
trained phlebotomist, or certified paramedic, or other qualified person
approved by the Department of State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content therein. This
limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.
         (b)   When a blood test of a person who has been taken to an adjoining
state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law enforcement
officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice
medicine in the adjoining state, a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist
acting under the direction of the physician, or certified paramedic. The law
enforcement officer requesting the test shall take custody of the blood sample,
and the blood sample shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the
Department of State Police for that purpose.
      (3)   The person tested may have a physician, or a qualified technician,
chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing
administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the
direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence
relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement
officer.
      (4)   Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a chemical test
or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information
concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or such
person's attorney.
      (5)   Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100
milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
   (B)   Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising
out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in
actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the
concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time alleged as
shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily
substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
      (1)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.05 or less,
it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
      (2)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of
0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that
the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was
under the influence of alcohol.
      (3)   If there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more,
it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
      (4)   The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the
question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (C)   (1)   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test
under the provisions of §
76.21, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action
or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the
person under the influence of alcohol, or other drugs, or combination of both
was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any ability to refuse under this code to submit to
these tests or any ability to revoke the implied consent to these tests, if a
law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle
driven by or in actual physical control of a person under the influence of
alcohol, any other drug, or combination of both has caused the death or
personal injury to another, that person shall submit, upon the request of a law
enforcement officer, to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath or
urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content thereof or the
presence of any other drug or combination of both. This provision does not
affect the applicability of or imposition of driver's license sanctions under §
76.21.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, a personal injury includes any “Type
A” injury as indicated on the traffic accident report completed by a law
enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a
doctor's office or a medical facility. A “Type A” injury includes severe
bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured
party to be carried from the scene.

following criteria are met:
      (1)   The chemical tests performed upon an individual’s blood, other
bodily substance, or urine were ordered in the regular course of providing
emergency medical treatment and not at the request of law enforcement
authorities;
      (2)   The chemical tests performed upon an individual’s blood, other
bodily substance, or urine were performed by the laboratory routinely used by
the hospital; and

§ 76.24 PRELIMINARY BREATH SCREENING TEST.
   If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person is
violating or has violated §
76.20, the officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to provide a
sample of his or her breath for a preliminary breath screening test using a
portable device approved by the Illinois State Police. The person may refuse
the test. The results of this preliminary breath screening test may be used by
the law enforcement officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination
of whether to require a chemical test as authorized under §§
76.21 and
76.22, and the appropriate type of test to request. Any chemical test
authorized under §§
76.21 and 76.22 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result of the
preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The
result of the preliminary breath screening test may be used by the defendant as
evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving a violation of §§
76.20 or
76.21.

NOT INVOLVING AN ARREST IN VIOLATION OF § 76.20; DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
ALCOHOL, OTHER DRUG OR DRUGS, INTOXICATING COMPOUNDS, OR ANY COMBINATION
THEREOF; CHEMICAL TEST.
   (A)   Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor vehicle upon
the public highways of the city shall be deemed to have given consent to a
breath test using a portable device as approved by the Department of State
Police or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, or urine for the
purpose of determining the alcohol or other drug content of such person's blood
if there is probable cause to believe that such person was the driver at fault,
in whole or in part, for a motor vehicle accident which resulted in the death
or personal injury of any person. This section shall not apply to those persons
arrested for a violation of §
76.20 or a similar violation of a local ordinance, in which case the provisions
of §
76.21 shall apply. Compliance with this section does not relieve such person
from the requirements of §
76.21.
   (B)   Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) above. In addition, if a driver
of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor vehicle
accident, any physician licensed to practice medicine, registered nurse of a
phlebotomist, acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall
withdrawal blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol or
other drugs, upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However,
no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion of the medical
personnel on the scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or
endangering the well-being of the patient.
   (C)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be
warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that refusal to
submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol
concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or
intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of
cannabis as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed
in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the
Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, as detected in such
person's blood, breath or urine, may result in the suspension of such person's
privileges to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the disqualification of
the person's privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided under
state law, if the person is a CDL holder. The length of the suspension shall be
the same as outlined under state law regarding statutory summary suspensions.
   (D)   (1)   If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which
discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug,
substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or
consumption of cannabis as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled
substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or methamphetamine
as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law
enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of
State on a form provided by the Secretary, certifying that the tests or tests
were requested pursuant to division (A) above and the person refused to submit
to a test or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of
0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance or intoxicating compound in
such person's blood or urine, resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of
cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in
the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the
Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the
Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the
Secretary shall enter the suspension and disqualification on the individual's
driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on
the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the
person.
      (3)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve
immediate notice of the suspension on the person and such suspension and
disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice
was given.
      (4)   In cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.08 or
more, or any amount fo a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting
from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis
Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled
Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating
Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and
Community Production Act is established by a subsequent analysis of blood or
urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice
as provided in this section or by deposit in the United States mail of that
notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to such person at his
address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension and
disqualification shall be effective on the 46th a following the date notice was
given.
      (5)   Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the
Secretary shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the
driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and
disqualification to the individual. However should the sworn report be
defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error,
the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the
person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be
returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.
   (E)   A driver may contest this suspension of his or her driving privileges
and disqualification of his or her CDL privileges by requesting an
administrative hearing with the Secretary in accordance with 625 ILCS 5/2-118.
At the conclusion of a hearing the Secretary may rescind, continue or modify
the orders of suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary does not
rescind the orders of suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving
permit may be granted by the Secretary upon application being made and good
cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue
hardship to allow driving for employment, educational and medical purposes as
outlined under 625 ILCS 5/6-206, the provisions of which shall apply. In
accordance with 49 CFR 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted
driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person
holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled
or disqualified.
   (F)   For purposes of this section, a personnel injury shall include any
Type A injury as indicated on the traffic accident report completed by a law
enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a
doctor's office or a medical facility. A Type A injury shall include severely
bleeding wounds, distorted extremities and injuries that require the injured
party to be carried from the scene.

blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of
the person’s blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform
Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar
provision of this chapter, if a police officer has probable cause to believe
that the driver has consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon
evidence of the driver’s physical condition or other first hand knowledge of
the police officer. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of
the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall
designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to two
additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even
after a blood or breath test or both has been administered.
   (B)   A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn the consent provided by division (A) and the test or tests may be

medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with
or endangering the well-being of the patient.
   (C)   A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be
warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to
submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol
concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that person’s
privilege to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the disqualification of
the person’s privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in
625 ILCS 5/6-514, if the person is a CDL holder. The loss of driving privileges
shall be imposed in accordance with 625 ILCS 5/6-208.2.

this section shall, except during the time the suspension is in effect, be
privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers,
prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, or the individual personally,
unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or
vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the
suspension shall not be privileged. Reports received by the Secretary of State
under this section shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a
person under the age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a
graduated driver’s license, regardless of whether the suspension is in effect.
      (3)   The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve
immediate notice of this suspension on the person and the suspension and
disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice
was given.
      (4)   In cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 is
established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or
urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in
this section or by deposit in the United States mail of that notice in an
envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person at his last known
address and the loss of driving privileges shall be effective on the 46th day

the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall
be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.
   (E)   (1)   A driver may contest this suspension and disqualification by
requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State in accordance
with 625 ILCS 5/2-118. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown
to be more than 0.00 is not subject to this section if he or she consumed
alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony. An individual
whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be
subject to this section if the individual’s blood alcohol concentration
resulted only from ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of
medicine that contained alcohol. The petition for that hearing shall not stay
or delay the effective date of the impending suspension. The scope of this
hearing shall be limited to the issues of:
         (a)   Whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that
the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon
the public highways of the state and the police officer had reason to believe
that the person was in violation of any provision of the Illinois Vehicle Code
or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and
         (b)   Whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any
violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local
ordinance; and
         (c)   Whether the police officer had probable cause to believe that
the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon the
driver’s physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer;
and
         (d)   Whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the
privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person refused
to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or
complete the test or tests to determine the person’s alcohol concentration; and
         (e)   Whether the person, after being advised by the officer that the
privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person submits
to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose an alcohol
concentration of more than 0.00, did submit to and complete the test or tests
that determined an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00; and
         (f)   Whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than
0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol in the performance of a
religious service or ceremony; and
         (g)   Whether the test result of an alcohol concentration of more than
0.00 was based upon the person’s consumption of alcohol through ingestion of
the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.
      (2)   At the conclusion of the hearing held under 625 ILCS 5/2-118, the
Secretary of State may rescind, continue, or modify the suspension and
disqualification. If the Secretary of State does not rescind the suspension and
disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary
of State upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving
permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship by allowing driving for
employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in 625 ILCS 5/6-206
(c)(3). The provisions of 625 ILCS 5/6-206(c)(3) and (f) shall apply. The
Secretary of State shall promulgate rules providing for participation in an
alcohol education and awareness program or activity, a drug education and
awareness program or activity, or both as a condition to the issuance of a
restricted driving permit for suspensions imposed under this section.
   (F)   The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance with
division (A) of this section are not admissible in any civil or criminal
proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a
hearing held under 625 ILCS 5/2-118. However, the results of the testing may
not be used to impose driver’s license sanctions under 625 ILCS 5/11-501.1. A
law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary suspension or
revocation of driving privileges under 625 ILCS 5/11-501.1 if other physical
evidence or first hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension or
revocation.
   (G)   This section applies only to drivers who are under age 21 at the time
of the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of the Illinois
Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and a chemical test
request is made under this section.
   (H)   The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking,
cancelling, or disqualifying any license or permit shall be subject to judicial
review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101
et seq.) and its rules are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every
action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of
State under this section.

   (A)   Except as provided in division (C) and in § 6-6.5 and § 6-33 of the
Liquor Control Act of 1934, no driver may transport, carry, possess or have any
alcoholic liquor within the passenger area of any motor vehicle upon a highway
in this city except in the original container and with the seal unbroken.
   (B)   Except as provided in division (C) and in § 6-6.5 and § 6-33 of the
Liquor Control Act of 1934, no passenger may carry, possess or have any
alcoholic liquor within any passenger area of any motor vehicle upon a highway
in this state except in the original container and with the seal unbroken.
   (C)   This section shall not apply to the passengers in a limousine when it

passengers on a chartered bus when it is being used for purposes for which
chartered buses are ordinarily used or on a motor home or mini motor home as
defined in 625 ILCS 5/1-145.01. However, the driver of any such vehicle is
prohibited from consuming or having any alcoholic liquor in or about the
driver’s area. Any evidence of alcoholic consumption by the driver shall be
prima facie evidence of such driver’s failure to obey this section. For the
purposes of this section, a LIMOUSINE is a motor vehicle of the first division
with the passenger compartment enclosed by a partition or dividing window used
in the for-hire transportation of passengers and operated by an individual in
possession of a valid Illinois driver’s license of the appropriate
classification pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/6-104.
   (D)   Any driver who is convicted of violating division (A) of this section
for a second or subsequent time within one year of a similar conviction shall
be subject to suspension of driving privileges as provided in 625 ILCS 5/6-205
(a)(13) and 625 ILCS 5/6-206(a)(33).

   (B)   When the Chief of Police seeks to impound a vehicle, as authorized in

90.04, or to remove an abandoned vehicle, as set out in §
90.02, or receives a notification of such abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed
motor vehicle, as set out in §
90.03, all sections of the ordinances of the city, the Chief of Police shall
give notice of the status of such vehicle, in writing, which notice shall
contain a description of the vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, to be
removed; and inform the recipient that he/she has a right to a hearing should
he/she demand one, and that such demand must be made in writing and delivered
to the City Clerk within five days from the date of the mailing of such notice
given him; and which notice shall be entitled “Notice to Abate Condition”;
which notice shall be served upon the owner of the premises as shown on the
assessment rolls of the county real estate tax assessor, or upon the lessee or
occupant of the premises; which notice shall be served by depositing the
notice, postage paid, in the United States Post Office in the city, directed to
the owner, lessee, or occupant. Such notice may also, at the option of the
Chief of Police, be personally served upon the owner, lessee, or occupant. If
the owner is not known, or resides outside the state, the notice shall be given
by posting a copy thereof conspicuously upon the vehicle or vehicles, or parts
thereof, to be removed, for five days. Service of notice shall be deemed to be
completed five days after posting. Such notice shall specify that if a vehicle
or vehicles, or parts thereof, are not removed within a period of 48 hours
after the notice, that the removal of the vehicle or vehicles, or parts
thereof, the assessment of administrative costs and the cost of the removal of
the vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, against the property upon which it
is located shall be accomplished unless a demand for hearing is filed within 48
hours from the date of the notice posted.
('72 Code, § 95.019.1) (Ord. passed 8-1-83)
§ 90.31 NOTICE.
   If the owner, lessee, or occupant of such premises does not abate the
condition set out in the notice, and remove the vehicle or vehicles, or parts
thereof, and demands a hearing, within 14 days after such demand, a public
hearing shall be held on the question of abatement of condition and removal of
the vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, as an abandoned vehicle as defined
in §§
90.02,
90.03,
90.04, the assessment of administrative costs, and the costs of removal of the
vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, against the property upon which it is
located. Notice of hearing shall be mailed at least ten days before the
hearing, by certified mail, with a five day return requested, to the owners of
the land as shown on the rolls of the county real estate tax assessor, or to
the last registered or legal owner of record, unless the vehicle is in such
condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership.
If any of the foregoing notices are returned undelivered by the United States
Post Office, the hearing shall be continued to a date not less than 48 hours
from the date of such return. The failure to receive such mail notices required
in this section shall not affect in any manner the validity of any abatement
proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, provided a notice of the
proceeding has been posted on the vehicle or vehicles, or parts thereof, sought
to be removed at least 48 hours before the hearing.
('72 Code, § 95.019.2) (Ord. passed 8-1-83)
§ 90.32 TESTIMONY; DISPOSITION.
   (A)   All hearings under this chapter shall be held before the Chief of
Police or his or her deputy who shall hear all facts and testimony he/she deems
pertinent. The facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of
the vehicle or part thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on
the private property or public property. The hearing officer shall not be
limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the
vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a written
statement in time for consideration, and deny responsibility for the presence
of the vehicle on the land with his or her reasons for such denial.
   (B)   The hearing officer may impose such conditions and take such other
action as he/she deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the
purpose of this chapter. He/she may delay the time for removal of the vehicle
or part thereof if, in his or her opinion, the circumstances justify it.
Circumstances that justify a delay of time shall be inclement weather
conditions or facts which give such hearing officer a reasonable belief that
within five days such vehicle shall be removed by owner. At the conclusion of
the public hearing, the hearing officer may find that a vehicle or part thereof
has been abandoned as set out in §§
90.02,
90.03, and
90.04, and order the same removed from the property as in violation of such
section and disposed of as hereinafter provided; and determine the
administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of
the parcel of land on which the vehicle or part thereof is located. The order
requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or part thereof
and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if
available at the site.
   (C)   If it shall be proved by the landowner by a preponderance of the
evidence affirmatively shown at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the
land without the consent of the landowner and that he/she has not subsequently
acquiesced in its presence, or despite the fact that the vehicle was originally
placed on the land with the consent of the landowner, the vehicle was
subsequently abandoned on the land without the consent of the landowner, the
hearing officer shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the
vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise
attempt to collect such costs from such landowner; provided, however, that the
hearing officer may have discretion to impose a requirement that the land be
posted with signs in such size and number to be determined by the hearing
officer prohibiting dumping of vehicles or other material or trespassing on the
land. Failure of the landowner to obey an order to post signs shall result in
the liability of the landowner for the cost of removal of any vehicles found
abandoned on the land 30 days after the date of any order in writing rendered
by the hearing officer requiring the posting of the signs.
   (D)   Costs will be assessed against and billed to the last registered and
legal owner of the vehicle if it is determined that the last registered and
legal owner was responsible for or acquiesced in the presence of the vehicle or
part thereof on the private or public property.
   (E)   If an interested party makes a written presentation to the hearing
officer, but does not appear, he/she shall be notified in writing of the
decision.
('72 Code, § 95.019.3) (Ord. passed 8-1-83)
§ 90.33 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any interested party may appeal the decision of the hearing officer by
filing a written notice of appeal with the hearing officer within five days
after his or her decision.
   (B)   Such appeal shall be heard by the City Council which may affirm, amend
or reverse the order or take other action deemed appropriate.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall give written notice of the time and place of the
hearing to the appellant and to those persons specified in §
90.30.
   (D)   In conducting the hearing, the City Council shall not be limited by
the technical rules of evidence.

§ 90.34 APPEAL TIME LIMIT; REMOVAL OF VEHICLE.
   Within 48 hours from the date of expiration of the right of appeal as set
forth in §

scrapyard or automobile dismantler's yard. After a vehicle has been removed, it

('72 Code, § 95.019.5) (Ord. passed 8-1-83)
§ 90.35 ADMINISTRATIVE AND REMOVAL COSTS; ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   If the administrative costs and the cost of removal which are charged
against the owner of a parcel of land pursuant to §
90.30 are not paid within 30 days of the date of the order, or the final
disposition of an appeal therefrom, such costs shall be assessed against the
parcel of land pursuant to the applicable section of the Illinois Statutes.
   (B)   If the administrative costs and cost of removal of the vehicle are to
be charged against the last registered and legal owner of the vehicle pursuant
to §
90.30, a bill covering the charges will be sent to the last registered and
legal owner of the vehicle by the Finance Director. If the bill is not paid
within 30 days from the date mailed, it shall be transmitted to the City

§ 90.99 PENALTY.

licensed premises closed for not more than seven days, giving the licensee the
opportunity to be heard during that period, except that is such licensee shall
also be engaged in the conduct of another business or businesses on the
licenses premises such order shall not be applicable to other such business or
businesses.
   (C)   The local liquor control commissioner shall within five days after
such hearing, if he/she determines after such hearing that the license should
be revoked or suspended or that the licensee should be fined, state the reason
or reasons for such determination in a written order, and either the amount of
the fine, the period of suspension, or that the license has been revoked, and
shall serve a copy of such order within five days upon the licensee.
   (D)   The licensee, after the receipt of an order of suspension or
revocation, shall have the privilege within a period of 20 days after the
receipt of such order of suspension or revocation of appealing the order to the
state commission for a decision sustaining, reversing, or modifying the order
of the local liquor control commissioner. If the state commission affirms the
local commissioner's order to suspend or revoke the license at the first
hearing, the appellant shall cease to engage in the business for which the
license was issued, until the local commissioner's order is terminated by its
own provisions or reversed upon rehearing or by the courts.

§ 130.02 INTENT.
   A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a
result or engage in conduct described by the section defining the offense, when
his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in
that conduct.
(720 ILCS 5/4-4)
§ 130.03 KNOWLEDGE.
   (A)   A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
      (1)   The nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct,
described by the section defining the offense, when he or she is consciously
aware that his or her conduct is of such nature or that such circumstances
exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the substantial
probability that the fact exists.
      (2)   The result of his or her conduct, described by the section defining
the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that such result is
practically certain to be caused by his or her conduct.
   (B)   Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed willfully,
within the meaning of a statute using the term “willfully”, unless the section

§ 130.04 RECKLESSNESS.
   A person is reckless or acts recklessly, when that person consciously
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or

“recklessly”, unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.

substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will
follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that failure
constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable
person would exercise in the situation.
(720 ILCS 5/4-7)
§ 130.06 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   Elements of the offense. A person commits the offense of attempt when,
with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that
constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.
   (B)   Impossibility.  It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that
because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible
for the accused to commit the offense attempted.
   (C)   A person convicted of an attempt may be fined not to exceed the
maximum provided for the offense attempted. If such fine exceeds that set forth
in §
10.99, however, the city shall enforce said offense under the provisions of
state law.

      (6)   Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented
or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
   (B)   Obscene defined. Any material or performance is OBSCENE if:
      (1)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient
interest;
      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;

of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to
disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement, or possession of a mold,
engraved plate, or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.001 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Without first securing a building permit, it is unlawful to construct or
alter any building or structure in the city where there are to be any changes
in the height, outside dimensions, any structural change, or where any bearing
wall of any building or structure is to be altered, or where a porch,
breezeway, carport or other roofed area is to be enclosed, or where a parking
lot is to be constructed.

1-09 )
Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 150.002 APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application for such permits shall be made to the City Clerk, and
shall be accompanied by a completed permit application, two site plans and two
sets of building plans. The Building Inspector shall review the plans within 14
days. Upon approval of the plans by the Building Inspector, the City Clerk will
contact the applicant to pick up the permit. The applicant must remit all
permit fees, hookup fees and impact fees (if any) prior to receiving the
approved building permit. All plans and papers shall be stamped “permit copy.”
The applicant shall sign the stamped, required inspections sheet and stamped,
electrical service handout. Upon payment of all fees, the applicant shall
receive a large, yellow hard copy of the permit to be posted at the job site.
   (B)   All building permit application documents and inspection reports shall
be kept in a job folder and filed in the active job file drawer in the City
Clerk’s office. The following shall also be applicable to the building permit
and construction processes:
      (1)   Applications for building permits with the required plans shall be
referred to the city Building Inspector who shall examine the same to determine
whether the proposed plans comply with the city ordinances and the adopted
codes relating thereto.
      (2)   When a building permit is required and work is commenced prior to
obtaining the permit, the specified fee(s) shall be doubled. The payment of
such doubled fee(s) shall neither relieve any person from fully complying with
the requirements of this code, from the completion of any work, nor from any
penalties prescribed therein.
      (3)   It is unlawful to vary materially from the approved plans and
specifications deposited with and approved by the city Building Inspector
unless amended plans and specifications showing such proposed alteration(s) or
variation(s) are first filed with the City Clerk and approved by the Building
Inspector.
      (4)   It shall be the duty of the city Building Inspector (and any other
person designated by the Mayor for such purpose) to enforce the provisions
herein. The city Building Inspector is empowered to make such inspections as
may be necessary to ensure enforcement of these provisions, and to make any
tests or examinations of materials or methods to be used, for the purpose of
determining if they comply with the requirements herein. When the applicant or
his or her designated agent requests the Building Inspector to make an
inspection, the following procedures shall be followed:
         (a)   The permit holder or his or her designated agent shall give at
least 24 hours’ advance notice, not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal
holidays;
         (b)   The person calling for the inspection shall provide his or her
name, telephone number, permit number and address of the property to be
inspected;
         (c)   If the Building Inspector needs to return more than once for the
same phase of any required inspection, an additional fee of $75 shall be paid
by the permit holder prior to continuing work on the project; and
         (d)   Work shall not proceed until the Building Inspector approves the
various stages of construction.
      (5)   If the permit holder does not call for required inspections, the
Building Inspector may require the permit holder or contractor to remove or
open any necessary materials for the inspections to be completed. Any
additional expenses for this shall be borne solely by the permit holder.
      (6)   The building permit shall become null and void if the approved work
has not commenced within six months from the date it was issued. The permit
also expires one year from the date it was issued. If the approved work is not
completed within one year, the permit holder may apply for a one-time six-month
extension, provided the permit holder demonstrates good and satisfactory
reasons beyond his or her control that the work cannot be completed within the
original one-year period.
('72 Code, § 151.002) (Am. Ord. 09-14, passed 6-1-09)
§ 150.003 APPROVAL OF PLANS.

who shall examine the same to determine whether the proposed construction or
alteration will comply with the ordinance provisions relative thereto. Upon
approval one set of plans shall be returned to the applicant with a permit, and
the other shall be retained by the Building Committee. No permit shall be
issued until after approval of the plans.
('72 Code, § 151.003)

   All laws of the state pertinent to the subdividing of lands and plats
therefor, as now or at any time hereafter may be in effect, are made a part of
this chapter as though written herein at length.
('72 Code, § 153.001)
§ 151.02 TENTATIVE PLAT.
   Prior to making a subdivision of any tract or parcel of land within the
city, there shall be filed with the City Clerk a tentative plat in duplicate.
This tentative plat shall be in compliance with the following requirements:
   (A)   Each plat shall be drawn to a scale of 200 feet to an inch. Variations
in scale may be made, however, where necessary for a proper exhibit of a
subdivision.
   (B)   All section lines, water courses and other existing features pertinent
to a proper subdivision shall be shown.
   (C)   Width of existing roads, streets with their names, alleys, lots,
easements, building lines on property proposed to be subdivided and full width
of intersecting streets in property adjacent, with their names. The location of
existing highways or streets in the subdivision, which may be separated by
intervening property, shall be shown.
   (D)   Name of proposed subdivision and name of owner or trustee as owner, or
name of sponsor for the plat, shall be shown; and a brief description as to
location shall be shown as part of the title.
   (E)   Names of all adjoining subdivisions shall be included and adjoining
property not subdivided shall be marked “Not Subdivided.”
   (F)   Where topography has significant bearing upon, or controls, layouts of
utility, contour lines at not greater than five-foot intervals shall be shown
on such tentative plat. The Mayor shall refer such tentative plats to the
proper official designated by the Mayor and City Council to act as examiner of
plats, who shall examine the same for conformity with the provisions of these
regulations. If approved, this notation shall be made on each copy of the
plats. If not approved, the points of conflict with these regulations shall be
noted on each copy of the plats. One copy of the plat in each case will then be
returned to the subdivider and the other copy shall be retained by the city.
('72 Code, § 153.002)
§ 151.03 GENERAL RULES.
   After approval of the tentative plat, the subdivision may be laid out,
subject to the following general rules which shall apply to each such layout:
   (A)   Each lot shall front on a road, street or parkway.
   (B)   Provisions shall be made for direct connections with the principal
streets in adjoining subdivisions, without offsets. Where practicable, streets
shall be provided having center lines on section, quarter-section or eighth-
section lines. Such streets shall be extended to the boundaries of the
subdivision.
   (C)   Where conditions warrant, the subdivider shall provide one-half the
width of streets bordering the subdivision.
   (D)   Private roads and streets shall be permitted only when the subdivider
permits sufficient evidence to the city that there can be no public interest in
such private road or street.
   (E)   The width of streets shall conform to the following:
      (1)   On any existing state bond issue or federal aid road within the
city which has been surveyed, laid out, constructed or reconstructed prior to
the time when approval of the tentative plat is given by the city, and on which
roads the width of the right-of-way has been specifically established by
recorded plats and dedications thereof, the new lot or property line adjacent
thereto shall be the established right-of-way line, except that in no case
shall the lot or property line adjacent thereto be nearer than 50 feet from the
survey line or center line of such right-of-way as shown and referred to in the
dedication and recorded plat thereof.
      (2)   On any existing state aid roads within the city, the new lot or
property line adjacent thereto shall be the such established right-of-way line,
except that in no case shall the lot or property line adjacent thereto, be
nearer than 40 feet from the center of the such road.
      (3)   Wherever new streets or roads are created or dedicated within the
proposed subdivision, and which are not of the type specified in (1) or (2)
above, they shall preferably be located and laid out on or along established
section, quarter-section or eighth-section lines, and such streets or roads
shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 60 feet, except that in unusual
cases where short streets or courts are necessary and where there is no
reasonable assurance that at some future time such streets will be carried
through to form a suitable connection with other streets, then such streets may
be laid out having a minimum right-of-way width of 50 feet. Where such streets
terminate at a dead end, a turn-around of not less than 120 feet in diameter
right-of-way, and not less than 88 feet in diameter back-to-back curb width
shall be provided, and dead end streets shall not be more than 500 feet in

width shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines for poles, wires,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water and heat mains, but which shall
not be used for that purpose until authorized by and under stipulated
regulations of proper authorities having jurisdiction.
   (H)   Blocks shall not be of greater length than 400 feet.
   (I)   Whenever possible, the side lines of lots shall be perpendicular to
the street line which forms the front of such lots.

graded to cross over all drainage ditches (with proper means provided for
continued use of such existing drainage) and the center portion of such
roadways shall be surfaced with at least ten inches of packed gravel or crushed
stone. A final surfacing material of Bituminous Surface Treatment, Class A-3,
shall be installed. Storm sewers, where needed, shall be constructed. If such
subdivision faces on any existing street or if any of its streets connect with
such existing streets, the subdivider shall build all culverts or other
drainage structures required along such existing streets on account of such
subdivision and the streets thereof. All such improvements shall be constructed
entirely at the expense of the subdivider according to the specifications or
approval of the City Council and the Superintendent of Streets, Alleys, and
Sidewalks, and in conformity with grade lines established by necessary surveys
made at the expense of the subdivider and approved by the Superintendent of
Streets, Alleys and Sidewalks and the Committee on Streets, Alleys and
Sidewalks. This minimum thickness for base course to be supplemented with sub-
base courses where necessary to compensate for poor sub-grade soil conditions.

with standard specifications aforementioned. The subdivider shall prepare plans
for the layout and shall obtain all necessary permits and approval of such
plans and permits by the city before commencement of any work under this
division.
   (R)   The subdivider shall do any grading, draining, surfacing and other
construction work in a manner as permanent as the material used will allow and
to the approval of the city. The subdivider shall do such work at his or her
own expense and shall either complete such work satisfactorily to the city
prior to the final approval of his or her subdivision plat by the city, or
deliver to the city a duplicate signed contract covering all of such work in
compliance with these regulations and a surety bond acceptable to the city
guaranteeing the completion of such work so contracted for within one year from

§ 152.002 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The prime tool of planning is land use control, most commonly referred to as

general welfare of the people.
   (B)   Divide the city into zones or districts restricting and regulating
therein the location, erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and
use of buildings, structures and land for residence, business, manufacturing
and other specified uses.
   (C)   Provide adequate light, air, privacy and convenience of access to
property.
   (D)   Protect the character and the stability of the residential, business
and manufacturing areas within the city and to promote the orderly and
beneficial development of such area.
   (E)   Regulate the intensity of use of lot areas, and to determine the area
of open spaces surrounding buildings, necessary to provide adequate light and
air, and to protect the public health.
   (F)   Establish building lines and the location of buildings for
residential, business and manufacturing, or other uses within such areas.
   (G)   Fix reasonable standards to which buildings or structures shall
conform therein.
   (H)   Prohibit uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the character
of development or intended uses within specified zoning districts.
   (I)   Prevent additions to or alteration or remodeling of existing buildings
or structures in such a way as to avoid the restrictions and limitations
imposed hereunder.
   (J)   Limit congestion in the public streets and protect the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare by providing for the off-street parking
of motor vehicles and the loading and unloading of commercial vehicles.
   (K)   Protect against fire, explosion, noxious fumes and other hazards in
the interest of the public health, safety, comfort and general welfare.
   (L)   Prevent the overcrowding of land and undue concentration of
structures, so far as is possible and appropriate in each district by
regulating the use and bulk of buildings in relation to the land surrounding
them.
   (M)    Conserve the taxable value of land and buildings throughout the city.
   (N)   Provide for the elimination of nonconforming uses of land, buildings
and structures which are adversely affecting the character and value of
desirable development in each district.
   (O)   Define and limit the powers and duties of the administrative officers
and bodies as provided herein.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)

§ 152.077 R-2-1 SPECIAL RESIDENCE DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The regulations of the R-2-1 special residence district are
intended to maintain and strengthen the unique physical environment in an older
established residential area, while providing for imaginative and compatible
adaptive use of structures which cannot be economically maintained for their
original intended use. There are specific physical characteristics which
contribute to the unique environment. Older residential structures of varied
architectural character include examples of historic styles. The visual
landscape along the street frontage is characterized by mature vegetation and
lawns. The spacing of existing structures in relationship to the street creates
a scale that is spacious and in proportion with the traditional residential
character. In order to preserve the physical character of the area, the R-2-
1 District provides for certain special uses of a nonresidential character
which will be compatible with and adaptable to the residential structures in
the district. These uses are intended to be compatible with the traditional
residential character of the area, and establishment of a special use should be
based upon maintenance and enhancement of the essential physical character of a
property, including the exterior facade of the principal structure, the visual
appearance of the front and side yard area, existing vegetation, landscape
character and traffic patterns.
   (B)   Permitted uses. No building or land shall be used and no building
shall hereafter be erected, structurally altered or enlarged unless otherwise
provided except for the following uses:
      (1)   Any of the uses permitted in R-1 and R-2 Districts;
      (2)   Existing structures designed for single-family use may be converted
for use for not more than four families, provided that all other requirements
of this division are complied with.
   (C)   Special uses. Special uses may be allowed if their site locations and
proposed development plans are first approved as provided in §§
152.170 through
152.181, and in accordance with the provisions of this section.

except as required to conform to city codes or to restore the structure to its
original architectural character.
         (b)   Signage shall be limited to one post or ground sign on the
property, not to exceed six feet in height, with no face of the sign to exceed
16 square feet in area, and no dimension to exceed six feet.
         (c)   Off-street parking shall not be located in front of the
established front building line, and shall be screened so that it is not
visible from the street.
         (d)   Side and rear lot lines abutting residentially zoned property

requirements of the zoning ordinance in effect immediately prior to said date)
for that lot and all other applicable requirements of this code. Further, if
the principal structure on the lot of record is damaged and the owner desires
to rebuild it, then it may be rebuilt upon the same footprint as the damaged
structure even though it may not comply with the then applicable setback
requirements. And, lastly, no property owner of any lot shall convey any part
of said lot if the lot is then not in compliance with the minimum area, width
or depth required by the code or, if not in compliance therewith on the
effective date of an ordinance relating to this issue would result further non-
compliance.
   (F)   Yard areas. The same requirements shall apply as in the R-2 District.

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 152.110 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of
the public streets and to promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.111 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this chapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all situations and buildings erected and all uses of land
established after August 4, 1986, accessory parking and loading facilities
shall be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which such
buildings or uses are located. However, where a building permit has been issued
prior to August 4, 1986, and provided that construction is begun within one
year of such effective date, and diligently prosecuted to completion, parking
and loading facilities as required hereinafter need not be provided.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or unloading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the building or structure
was erected prior to August 4, 1986, additional parking or loading are
mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use would
exceed those for the existing use if the latter were subject to the parking and
loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
or loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served and which were in existence on August 4, 1986, or were provided
voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced below or,
if already less than, shall not further be reduced below the requirements of
this chapter for a similar new building or use.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided
that all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on August 4, 1986, which subsequent
thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause,
and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-street parking or
loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or
destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case
shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in
excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or
construction.
   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where
the plans call for parking facilities other than on the zoning lot unless and
until the applicant has shown that the common ownership or ownership or
possession of the zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are
reasonably certain to continue and that the off-site parking facilities will be
maintained at all times during the life of the proposed use or building.
   (F)   Submission of plot plan. Any application for a building permit or for
a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required shall include
therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.112 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to
residential uses in accordance with the requirements of this section shall be
used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants of the
dwelling structures to which such facilities are accessory or by guests of the
occupants. Under no circumstances shall required parking facilities accessory
to residential uses be used for the storage of commercial vehicles or for the
parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants, visitors or
customers of business or manufacturing establishments.
   (B)   Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use.
   (C)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of fractional space,
any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess
of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (D)   Size. A required off-street parking space shall be at least eight and
one-half feet in width and at least 20 feet in length, exclusive of access
drives or aisles.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly

   Compensation for members of Zoning Board of Appeals attending meetings, see
§
31.215
§ 152.140 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The Board, after public hearing, may determine and vary the
regulations of this chapter in harmony with their general purpose and intent,
only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth, where the Board of
Appeals makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed, and further finds that there are practical difficulties or
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the regulations of
this chapter.
   (B)   Application for variation and notice of hearing. An application for a
variation shall be filed in writing with the Buildings and Grounds Committee.
The application shall contain such information as the board may from time to
time, by rule, require.
      (1)   Variations other than those authorized by division (D)(1) to (7) of
this section on which the Board may act, shall be submitted to the Board and
acted on in the following manner:
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall publish notice of a public
hearing on such application for variation, stating the time and place and the
purpose of the hearing. Such publication shall be at least 15 days in advance
of such hearing, but not more than 30 days prior to such hearing, and shall be
published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. In addition,
notice of the public hearing shall be mailed to the petitioner and the owners
of all property deemed by the Zoning Board of Appeals to be affected thereby.
The cost of publication and the cost of notifying the affected property owners
shall be borne by the petitioner.
      (3)   (a)   The Board shall, within 30 days after the public hearing, or
hearing, make its recommendations to the City Council in writing. The City
Council shall pass upon such petition for variance no later than the third
regular meeting of the City Council following receipt of the Board’s written
recommendations. If the City Council refers the matter back to the Board for
further consideration, the time lines provided herein for the Board’s written
recommendations and the City Council’s deadline for making a final decision
begin anew.
         (b)   In the event that the City Council fails to act on the petition
within the time limits as provided above, such Petition shall be deemed to have
been granted.
         (c)   Any proposed variance which fails to receive the approval of the
Zoning Board of Appeals shall not be passed by the corporate authorities except
by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all aldermen then holding office.
   (C)   Standards for variations. The Board shall not vary the regulations of
this chapter, nor recommend to the City Council variation of this chapter,
unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each
specific case that:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of the regulation were carried out.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variation is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable,
generally to other property within the same zoning classification.
      (3)   The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire
to make more money out of the property.
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this chapter and
has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the
property.
      (5)   The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located.
      (6)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of fire or
endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values
within the neighborhood. The Board may impose such conditions and restrictions
from upon the premises benefited by variation as may be necessary to comply
with the standards established in this division (6) to reduce or minimize the
effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and to better
carry out the general intent of this chapter.
   (D)   Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this chapter
shall be granted by the Board only in accordance with the standards established
in division (C) above, and may be granted only in the following instances and
in no others:
      (1)   To permit any yard or setback less than the yard or setback
required by the applicable regulations, but not more than 50%.
      (2)   To permit the use of a residential lot or lots for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or length or width of the
residential lot or lots subject to § 152.075. For real estate not classified as
residential, the owner(s) may apply for a variation to permit the use of said
lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient
area or length or width of said lot or lots, but in no event shall the
respective area or length or width of the lot be less than 90% of the required
area, length or width.
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided the substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week.
      (4)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 20% of the
applicable regulations, whichever number is greater.
      (5)   To increase by not more than 25% percent the maximum distance
required that parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use served.
      (6)   To increase by not more than 20% the gross area of any sign.
      (7)   To increase by not more than 10% percent the maximum gross floor
area of any use so limited by the applicable regulations.
      (8)   To permit the division of an existing improved zoning lot into two
or more improved zoning lots even though one or more of the resulting lots does
not conform with all of the applicable bulk regulations of the zoning district
in which the property is located.
      (9)   To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this
section, when the lot of record on a zoning lot, vacant or legally used on
August 4, 1986, is by reason of the exercise of the right of eminent domain by
any authorized governmental body or by reason of a conveyance and under threat
of an eminent domain proceeding reduced in size so that the remainder of the
lot of record or zoning lot or structure on the lot does not conform with one
or more of the regulations of the district in which the lot of record or zoning
lot or structure is located. The concurring vote of four members of the Board
shall be necessary to grant a variation. No order of the Board granting a
variation shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of
such order, unless a building permit is obtained within such period and the
erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced within
such period.
      (10)   In addition to and not in lieu of the existing “authorized
variations”, the city may also grant a variance for the erection of a fence of
more than 48 inches in height but not more than 72 inches in height between the
property line and 24 inches from the property line (see §
152.018(F)(1)(e)). If the city grants such variance, then prior to receiving a
building permit for such fence placement, the owner(s) shall submit evidence of
boundary monumentation prepared by an Illinois Registered Land Surveyor, and
further provided that the fence does not extend beyond the front of the
residence as it faces the street. The application for a zoning variation shall
be subject to the required conditions and procedures as provided in the City of
Polo Code of Ordinances.
      (11)   To permit the height of a private garage to exceed 14 feet.

(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
SPECIAL USES
§ 152.170 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The development and execution of a zoning ordinance is based upon the
division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of the land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location.
   (B)   Such special uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character but of such unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.171 INITIATION OF SPECIAL USES.
   Any person owning or having an interest in the subject property may file an
application to use such land for one or more of the special uses provided for
in this chapter in the zoning district in which the land is situated.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.172 APPLICATION FOR SPECIAL USES.
   An application for a special use or extension of special use shall be filed
with the City Clerk on a form prescribed by the City Clerk. The application
shall be accompanied by such plans or data prescribed and shall include a
statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the
proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth in §
152.175.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.173 HEARING ON APPLICATION.
   (A)   Upon receipt of an application for special use, the Buildings and
Grounds Committee shall review such application to determine that it contains
all and sufficient information, as required by this chapter. Thereafter, the
Building and Grounds Committee shall refer such application to the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
   (B)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing in regard to
the application for special use. Notice of the time, place and purpose of such
hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at
least 15 days in advance of such hearing, but not more than 30 days in advance
of such hearing. The cost of publication for such notice shall be borne by the
petitioner.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.174 AUTHORIZATION.
   For each application for a special use, the Building and Grounds Committee
shall report to the City Council its findings and recommendations, including
the stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such conditions
will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the protection of the
public interest. The City Council may grant or deny any application for a
special use; provided, however, that in the event of written protest against
any proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of the
frontage adjacent thereto, or across any alley, or directly opposite therefrom,
such special use shall not be granted, except by the favorable vote of two-
thirds of all the members of the City Council. Any proposed special use which
fails to receive the approval of the Board of Appeals shall not be passed by
the corporate authorities, except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all
aldermen then holding office.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.175 STANDARDS.
   No special use shall be recommended by the Building and Grounds Committee
unless the Committee shall find:
   (A)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
   (B)   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair values within the neighborhood.
   (C)   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
   (D)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage or other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided.
   (E)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
   (F)   That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the City Council, pursuant to
the recommendation of the Building and Grounds Committee.
(Ord. passed 8-4-86)
§ 152.176 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS.

from other special uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions
are hereby established to govern the recommendations of the Building and
Grounds Committee and the action of the City Council.
   (B)   The Building and Grounds Committee may recommend, and the City Council
may authorize that there be in part of the area of a planned development, and
for the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the use

the Building and Grounds Committee shall find that:
      (1)   The uses permitted by such exceptions as are necessary or desirable
and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the development.
      (2)   The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so
located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the surrounding neighborhood.
      (3)   Not more than 30% of the ground area, or of the gross floor area,
of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted by the exception.
      (4)   In an industrial planned developments such additional uses allowed
by exception shall conform with the performance standards of the district in
which the development is located.
      (5)   That the use exceptions so allowed are reflected by the appropriate
zoning district symbols and so recorded on the zoning district map.

district in which the planned development is located, provided that the
Building and Grounds Committee shall find:
   (A)   That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting a

bulk regulations of this chapter for buildings developed on separate lots.
   (B)   That the overall floor area ratio, when applicable, would not exceed
by more than 15% of the floor area ratio regulations of this chapter for the
district in which it is located.
   (C)   That in the part of the planned development containing only

§ 152.179 CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES.
   Prior to the granting of any special use, the Building and Grounds Committee

§ 152.182 GROUND MOUNTED SOLAR PANELS.
   (A)   No permit for the installation of ground mounted solar panels shall be
issued unless the City Council of the City of Polo has granted a permit for
such.
   (B)   Any property owner or other authorized person or entity (“applicant”)
who desires to place ground mounted solar panels in the City of Polo, must
petition the Zoning Board of Appeals and request a special use permit. This
section applies to all zoning classifications in the city.
   (C)   The “use” of ground mounted solar panels shall be classified as an
“accessory use”.
   (D)   The following shall be required considerations for the ZBA and the
City Council when deciding whether to grant or deny an applicant’s petition:
      (1)   Ground mounted solar panels should only be permitted when roof
mounting is not feasible.
      (2)   The height of the panels must not exceed ten feet from the ground.
      (3)   The panels must meet setback requirements as established elsewhere
in the Code of Ordinances and must be located in the rear yard only and must be
located at least ten feet from any residence.
      (4)   The Board should consider whether the panels will create a
reflective glare which may be objectionable to neighboring properties.
      (5)   At the public hearing on a petition for a special use permit, the
Board may consider such other factors as deemed relevant to the Board.
      (6)   The property owner must present a plan acceptable to the Board and
the City Council for decommissioning the ground mounted solar panels when their
useful life ends and in the event that the special use permit is terminated as
provided in the Code of Ordinances. If the solar service is out of service or
not producing electrical energy for a period of 12 months, it will be deemed
nonoperational and decommissioning and removal of that service will need to
commence according to the decommissioning plan as provided and approved. A cost
estimate for the decommissioning of the service and restoration of the land
shall be prepared by a professional engineer or contractor who has expertise in
the removal of the solar panels and service with said cost to be the property
owner’s responsibility. The decommissioning cost shall be made by cash, surety
bond, escrow account, or irrevocable letter of credit before installation
commences. Further, a restoration plan shall be provided for the site with the
application. The decommissioning plan shall have the following provided:
         (a)   Removal of the following within six months:
            1.   All solar panels/collectors and components, above ground
solar-related improvements, and outside storage related to the solar system.
            2.   Foundations, pads and underground electrical wires; reclaim
site to a depth of not less than five feet below the surface of the ground.
            3.   Hazardous material from the property and dispose of same in
accordance with federal and state law.
         (b)   The decommissioning and restoration plan shall also recite an
agreement between the applicant and the city that:
            1.   The financial resources for decommissioning shall be in the
form of a surety bond, escrow account, or other acceptable form of funds
approved by the Mayor following consultation with the City Council, the City
Clerk and the City Treasurer.
            2.   A written agreement will be prepared which establishes upon
what conditions the funds will be disbursed.
            3.   The city shall have access to the account funds for the
expressed purpose of completing decommissioning if decommissioning is not
completed by the applicant within six months of the end of project life or
facility abandonment.
            4.   If the property owner does not complete the decommissioning
and restoration plan, the city is granted the right of entry onto the site,
pursuant to reasonable notice, to effect or complete decommissioning.
            5.   The city is granted the right to seek injunctive relief to
effect or complete decommissioning, as well as the city's right to seek
reimbursement from applicant or applicant successor for decommissioning costs
in excess of the amount deposited in the account and to file a lien against any
real estate owned by the applicant or applicant’s successor, or in which they
have an interest, for the amount of the excess, and to take all steps allowed
by law to enforce said lien.
            6.   The terms of the decommissioning plan shall be binding upon
the owner/operator and any of their successors, assigns, or heirs.
            7.   Financial provisions are not intended to be so onerous as to
make solar power projects unfeasible.
         (c)   The owner shall provide the city with a new estimate of the cost
of decommissioning the solar energy project every five years. Salvage value of
structures, electrical wire, and other appurtenances shall be considered within
the cost estimate calculations. Upon receipt of the new estimate, the city will
have the right to require a new financial plan for decommissioning acceptable
to the city. Failure to provide an acceptable financial plan shall be
considered a cessation of operations.
   (E)   For all solar energy projects for the generation of electricity (i.e.,
not limited to ground mounted solar panels) in the City of Polo, the service
must comply with all applicable codes adopted by the City of Polo.

§ 152.200 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   The Polo City Council finds that sexually oriented businesses are
associated with high crime rates in certain areas; deteriorated commercial and
residential areas; depreciation of property values in the area; and dramatic
changes in the character of the neighborhood when more than one sexually
oriented business is operating in a given area.
   (B)   It is the intent of regulating adult uses to protect the public
health, safety and welfare of the community by limiting the deleterious effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the use and enjoyment of property in
adjacent areas.
