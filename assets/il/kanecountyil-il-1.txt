A majority of the quorum of the public body may excuse the use of video.
      3.   The recording secretary or clerk, via county board office staff,
after receiving the remote attendance request, shall inform the designated

where a member desires to attend remotely by other means, the presiding officer
shall state that the member has notified the recording secretary or clerk of
their desire to attend the meeting by other means. The member will be deemed
authorized to attend the meeting by other means unless a motion objecting to
the member’s attendance is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the
members of the county board or the county board committee physically present at
the meeting.
      5.   Any member attending remotely by other means shall be counted as

a member’s microphone when the member is not speaking or voting in order to
eliminate disruptive background noise.

attendance via video conferencing may have to share their screen. It is the
member’s responsibility to protect their privacy and the information that they
may not want to share with the public.
      11.   The member attending remotely shall have the same rights to
participate in discussions and vote as if the member were physically present.
      12.   At an executive session or closed session of the county board, the
member attending remotely by other means must comply with the privacy and
confidentiality requirements of the meeting and confirm such compliance on the
record.

concerns, in accordance with the provisions of the Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS
120/7(e)). (Res. of 7-10-1973; Res. 83-204, §§ 1, 2, 12-13-1983; Ord. 94-256,

the plan pursuant to subsection A of this section on behalf of any participant,
other than by means of a rollover or transfer, shall not exceed the lesser of:
a) the applicable dollar amount as set forth in code section 457(e)(15) or b)
one hundred percent (100%) of the participant's compensation for the taxable
year.
      2.   Age Fifty Catch Up Contributions: All participants who have attained
age fifty (50) before the close of the plan year shall be eligible to make
catch up contributions in accordance with, and subject to the limitations of,
section 414(v) of the code.
      3.   Limited Catch Up Contributions: In addition to subsection B2 of this
section, for one or more of the participant's last three (3) taxable years
ending before he attains his normal retirement age under the plan, the
participant's maximum deferral shall be the larger of: a) the amount specified
in subsection B1 of this section or b) the lesser of: 1) twice the applicable
limit set forth in section 457(e)(15) of the code reduced by any amount
excludable from the participant's gross income attributable to deferrals to
another section 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan or 2) the
"underutilized limitation". The "underutilized limitation" is the sum of the
"plan ceiling" (that is, the lesser of the applicable limit set forth in
section 457(e)(15) or 100 percent of the participant's includable compensation
reduced by any amount excludable from the participant's gross income
attributable to deferrals to another section 457(b) eligible deferred
compensation plan) for the taxable year, plus so much of the limit established
in section 457(b)(2) for taxable years before the taxable year as has not been
previously used (that is, the 457(b)(2) limit for any prior taxable year or
years, less the amount of annual deferrals under the plan for such prior
taxable year or years [disregarding any annual deferrals under the plan
permitted under the first paragraph above]). A prior taxable year is taken into
account under the preceding sentence only if it is a year beginning after
December 31, 1978, in which the participant was eligible to participate in the
plan, and in which compensation deferred (if any) under the plan during the
year was subject to the plan ceiling. However, this subsection B3 shall not
apply with respect to any participant who has previously utilized in whole or
in part the limited catch up under this plan or any other section 457 eligible
deferred compensation plan.
   C.   Coordination With Other Plans: If a participant participates in more
than one code section 457(b) plan, the maximum deferral under all such plans
shall not exceed the applicable limit described in subsection B1 of this
section (subject to modification by the catch up limitations described in
subsections B2 and B3 of this section).
   D.   Correction Of Excess Deferrals: If the annual deferral on behalf of a
participant for any calendar year exceeds the limitations described in
subsection B of this section, or the annual deferral on behalf of a participant
for any calendar year exceeds the limitations described above when combined
with other amounts deferred by the participant under another eligible deferred
compensation plan under section 457(b) of the code for which the participant
provides information that is accepted by the plan administrator, then the
annual deferral, to the extent in excess of the applicable limitation (adjusted
for any income or loss in value, if any, allocable thereto), shall be
distributed to the participant as soon as administratively feasible.
   E.   Modifications To Amount Deferred: A participant may elect to change his
or her elective deferral rate with respect to future compensation by submitting
a new properly executed elective deferral agreement to the county. Such change
shall take effect as soon as administratively practicable but not earlier than
the first pay period commencing with or during the first month following
receipt by the county of such elective deferral agreement.
   F.   Termination Of Deferral: A participant may terminate his or her
election to have compensation deferred by so notifying the county in writing.
Such termination shall take effect as soon as administratively practicable, but
not earlier than the first pay period commencing with or during the first month
following receipt by the county of satisfactory written notice of such
revocation.
   G.   Vesting: A participant shall be fully vested at all times in his or her
elective deferrals under this plan. Such elective deferrals shall be
nonforfeitable at all times.
   H.   Uniform Services: Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the
contrary, contributions, benefits, and service credit with respect to qualified
military service will be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the
code. (Ord. 05-287, 8-9-2005)
2-90: INVESTMENTS:
Participants will direct the investment of their accounts among the investment
options made available by the plan administrator. If any provision of an
investment option agreement is not consistent with the plan provisions, the
terms of the plan shall control. All amounts of compensation deferred under
this plan, all property and rights which may be purchased with such amounts and
all income attributable to such amounts, property or rights shall be held in
trust, a custodial account, or annuity contract described in code section 401
(f) for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries. (Ord.

   A.   Eligible Rollover Contributions To The Plan:
      1.   A participant who is an employee and who is entitled to receive an
eligible rollover distribution from another eligible retirement plan may
request to have all or a portion of the eligible rollover distribution paid to
the plan. The plan administrator may require such documentation from the
distributing plan as it deems necessary to effectuate the rollover in
accordance with section 402 of the code and to confirm that such plan is an
eligible retirement plan within the meaning of section 402(c)(8)(B) of the
code.
      2.   For purposes of subsection A1 of this section, an "eligible rollover
distribution" means any distribution of all or any portion of a participant's
benefit under another eligible retirement plan, except that an eligible
rollover distribution does not include: a) any installment payment for a period
of ten (10) years or more, b) any distribution made as a result of an
unforeseeable emergency or other distribution which is made upon hardship of
the employee, or c) for any other distribution, the portion, if any, of the
distribution that is a required minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9) of
the code. In addition, an eligible retirement plan means an individual
retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code, an individual
retirement annuity described in section 401(a) of the code, an annuity plan
described in section 403(a) or 403(b) of the code, or an eligible governmental
plan described in section 457(b) of the code, that accepts the eligible
rollover distribution.
      3.   The plan shall establish and maintain for the participant a separate
account for any eligible rollover distribution paid to the plan from any
eligible retirement plan that is not an eligible governmental plan under
section 457(b) of the code. In addition, the plan shall establish and maintain
for the participant a separate account for any eligible rollover distribution
paid to the plan from any eligible retirement plan that is an eligible
governmental plan under section 457(b) of the code.
   B.   Plan To Plan Transfers To The Plan: At the direction of the employer,
the plan administrator may permit a class of participants who are participants
in another eligible governmental plan under section 457(b) of the code to
transfer assets to the plan as provided in this subsection B. Such a transfer
is permitted only if the plan provides for the direct transfer of each
participant's interest therein to the plan. The plan administrator may require
in its sole discretion that the transfer be in cash or other property
acceptable to the plan administrator. The plan administrator may require such
documentation from the other plan as it deems necessary to effectuate the
transfer in accordance with section 457(e)(10) of the code and section 1.457-10
(b) of the income tax regulations and to confirm that the other plan is an
eligible governmental plan as defined in section 1.457-2(f) of the income tax
regulations. The amount so transferred shall be credited to the participant's
account and shall be held, accounted for, administered and otherwise treated in
the same manner as an elective deferral by the participant under the plan,
except that the transferred amount shall not be considered under the plan in
determining the maximum deferral under subsection 2-89B of this chapter.
   C.   Plan To Plan Transfers From The Plan:
      1.   At the direction of the employer, the plan administrator may permit
a class of participants and beneficiaries to elect to have all or any portion
of their account transferred to another eligible governmental plan within the
meaning of section 457(b) of the code and section 1.457-2(f) of the income tax
regulations. A transfer is permitted under this subsection C1 for a participant
only if the participant has had a severance from employment with the employer
and is an employee of the entity that maintains the other eligible governmental
plan. Further, a transfer is permitted under this subsection C1 only if the
other eligible governmental plan provides for the acceptance of plan to plan
transfers with respect to the participants and beneficiaries and for each
participant and beneficiary to have an amount deferred under the other plan
immediately after the transfer at least equal to the amount transferred.
      2.   Upon the transfer of assets under this subsection C, the plan's
liability to pay benefits to the participant or beneficiary under this plan
shall be discharged to the extent of the amount so transferred for the
participant or beneficiary. The plan administrator may require such
documentation from the receiving plan as it deems appropriate or necessary to
comply with this subsection C (for example, to confirm that the receiving plan
is an eligible governmental plan under subsection C1 of this section, and to
assure that the transfer is permitted under the receiving plan) or to
effectuate the transfer pursuant to section 1.457-10(b) of the income tax
regulations. (Ord. 05-287, 8-9-2005)

the facts of each case, but, in any case, payment may not be made to the extent
that such hardship is or may be relieved:

         b.   By liquidation of the participant's assets, to the extent that
liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship; or

a distribution due to an unforeseeable emergency by submitting a written
request to the plan administrator, accompanied by evidence to demonstrate that
the circumstances being experienced qualify as an unforeseeable emergency. The
plan administrator shall have the authority to require such evidence, as it

designated beneficiary, distributions may be made in substantially equal annual
payments over a period of ten (10) years commencing no later than the December
31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
participant died;

31 of the calendar year in which distributions would be required to begin under
this subsection D, or b) the December 31 of the calendar year which contains

2-125: CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR OFFICERS:

performance of his/her official duties.
   B.   No officer may charge to or accept from a person known to have an
interest in the county a price, fee, compensation or other consideration for
the sale or lease of any property or the furnishing of services which is
substantially in excess of that which the officer would charge in the ordinary

of any other person, may disclose or use confidential information acquired in

reason for him/her to believe that it is being offered with intent to obtain
improper influence over a Kane County agency.
   E.   No officer may use or attempt to use improper means to influence a Kane
County agency in any representation case in which the officer or any person
with whom he/she maintains a close economic association is participating.
   F.   No officer may engage in other conduct which is unbecoming to an
officer or which constitutes a breach of public trust.
   G.   Where feasible, and taking into account the fact that officers may
serve part time, officers should avoid accepting or retaining an economic
opportunity which presents a substantial threat to his/her independence of
judgment.
   H.   When an officer must take official action on a matter as to which he/
she has a conflict situation created by a personal, family, or client interest,
he/she should consider the possibility of eliminating the interest creating the
conflict situation. If that is not feasible, he/she should consider the
possibility of abstaining from such official action. In making his/her decision
as to abstention, the following factors should be considered:
      1.   Whether a substantial threat to his/her independence of judgment has
been created by the conflict situation.
      2.   The effect of his/her participation on public confidence in the
integrity of the county.
      3.   Whether his/her participation is likely to have any significant
effect on the disposition of the matter.
      4.   The need for his/her particular contribution, such as special
knowledge of the subject matter, to the effective functioning of his/her office
or the county.
      5.   He/she need not abstain if he/she decides to participate in a manner
contrary to the economic interest which creates the conflict situation.
      6.   If he/she does abstain, he/she should disclose that fact to his/her
respective agency or body.
   I.   When, despite the existence of a conflict situation, an officer chooses
to take official action on a matter, he/she should serve the public interest
and not the interest of any person.
   J.   An officer participating in a representation case shall disclose,
wherever feasible, their participation in a representation case.
   K.   Employees or officers shall not intentionally disclose any information
discussed during executive session of the county board or any of its
committees.

with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive working environment.

another county officer: In addition to the procedures outlined in the county's
Policy, a county officer may report a complaint of sexual harassment against
another county officer to the ethics advisor for an independent review. The

shall take immediate action (keeping with the procurement process of the
county) to retain a qualified individual or entity for the independent review
of the allegations of sexual harassment, with costs to be paid from the
county's contingency fund, insurance liability fund, or such other funds

support payments. (Ord. 86-120, § 1, 9-9-1986)
DIVISION 2. INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
2-197: PURPOSE; POWERS; GENERAL CONDITIONS:
   A.   Industrial revenue bonds are tax exempt securities issued for the
purpose of building and equipping industrial facilities, which facilities may
be leased to responsible companies. In the alternative, the county may simply
loan the proceeds of the industrial revenue bonds to a responsible company
without the necessity of entering into a lease of the financed facilities. The
county authority includes the power to build, rebuild, acquire, improve or
extend industrial buildings as well as the acquisition of machinery and
equipment. Industrial revenue bonds issued to finance facilities are to be
repaid from lease or loan repayments made by the company, which lease or loan
repayments must be sufficient to amortize the bonds. The rentals or loan
repayments are used to pay the principal and interest requirements on the
bonds. The company must have sufficient financial strength to assure the
retirement of the bonds.
   B.   If a lease agreement is used, the lease agreement stipulates that the
company may acquire the project from the county after the bonds are retired for
a nominal fee. The lease or loan agreement will further provide that the
company accepts an unconditional obligation to make lease or loan payments and
satisfy other agreements of the lease or loan agreement so long as any part of
the bond issue remains outstanding. The county will in no way be liable for the
payment of the bonds or interest due thereon; however, holders of the bonds
will have a lien on the rentals or loan repayments due under the lease or loan
agreement. (Res. 86-37, § A, 3-11-1986; Res. 88-111, 7-12-1988)
2-198: USES:
Industrial revenue bonds may be sold to finance the cost of industrial
buildings, for use as a factory, mill, processing plant, assembly plant,
packaging plant, fabricating plant, office building, industrial distribution
center, warehouse, repair, overhaul or service facility, freight terminal,
research facility, test facility, railroad facility or commercial facility, and
also including the sites therefor and other rights and land therefor whether
improved or unimproved, site preparation and landscaping, and all appurtenances
and facilities thereto incidental, including machinery and equipment. (Res. 86-
37, § B, 3-11-1986; Res. 88-111, 7-12-1988)
2-199: ADVANTAGES:
   A.   Advantages To Industry: The attraction of industrial revenue bonds is
the lower rate of interest they must pay compared to the rate currently
available in the conventional money market.
   B.   Advantages To Bond Purchasers: The principal advantage of industrial
revenue bond financing derives from the fact that the interest on the bonds is
exempt from federal and state taxation (subject to certain limitations).
   C.   Advantages To County: The industrial revenue bond financing procedure
provides a valuable means to increase employment opportunities within the
county area and the state. (Res. 86-37, §§ C-E, 3-11-1986)
2-200: SALE:
As a general policy, the county requires the company to arrange for the private
placement of the bonds with a reputable financial institution. The repayment
schedule for industrial revenue bonds may be negotiated to best suit the needs
of the company. It may be level debt service or any variation acceptable to the
bond purchasers, including balloon, serial and term bonds. Length and maturity
schedules are also subject to negotiations. (Res. 86-37, § F, 3-11-1986)
2-201: TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS:
   A.   Each revenue bond project must stand alone on the obligation of the
tenant company, security by a mortgage of the project and other pledges of
securities; i.e., fixtures, personal property, rolling stock, given by the
tenant company.
   B.   Industrial revenue bonds may be issued for a maximum of forty (40)
years. However, the retirement schedule is generally shorter, depending on the
size of the issue and other bond market considerations. Illinois law places no
limit on the size of the issue. Federal taxation legislation limits United
States income tax exemption for industrial revenue bond issues to ten million
dollars ($10,000,000.00). Bonds issued for financing pollution control
facilities are not limited as to amount. In addition, bonds issued for
financing facilities to be owned and operated by entities exempt from taxation
under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code are not limited as to
amount.
   C.   Bonds are not considered a liability of the county or a charge against
the county's general credit.
   D.   In order to preserve the tax exempt status of the bonds, the bond
issue, after notice and public hearing, must be approved by an elected
legislative body or an elected public official. In addition, if the facility to
be financed by the issue is to be located in whole or in part outside of the
geographical jurisdiction of the issuer, the issue, must be approved, after
public hearing, by a legislative body or an elected public official.
   E.   A statement must be filed with the internal revenue service by the
issuer no later than the fifteenth day of the second month following the close
of the calendar quarter during which the bonds are issued. (Res. 86-37, § G, 3-
11-1986; Res. 88-111, 7-12-1988)
2-202: CUSTOMARY CLAUSES TO BE INCLUDED IN LEASE:
The following clauses are customarily included in the lease or loan agreement:
   A.   The limit of the lease or loan agreement.
   B.   Amount of periodic rental or loan repayments to be paid by the company
to amortize the bond issue.
   C.   Provisions indicating that the company must pay all expenses of repair
and maintenance.
   D.   Provisions indicating that the company must pay all insurance expenses,
including liability for property damage, personal injury and workers'
compensation.
   E.   Provisions indicating that the company must pay all taxes and special
assessments levied upon the property.
   F.   Provisions indicating that the company must maintain all real and
personal properties without waste, regardless of whether the company is the
owner or the lessee of said properties.
   G.   If a lease agreement is used, an option to purchase or release the
property at the termination of the lease.
   H.   If a trustee is employed, clauses defining the relationships between
the trustee, the county and the company.
   I.   Duties of the county. (Res. 86-37, § H, 3-11-1986; Res. 88-111, 7-12-
1988)
2-203: PROCEDURES:
A company interested in exploring the feasibility of industrial revenue bond
financing within the county should follow the hereinafter described procedures:
   A.   The county board office shall be contacted by a representative of the
company and apprised of the proposed bond issue. The county board office should
then notify the chairman of the executive committee and the director of the
county development department. The executive committee will review and make
recommendations to the full county board on all requests for bonds or financing
to further building and expansion of industry and business.
   B.   After the board chairman is notified of the proposed bond issue, a
representative of the company should contact the county board executive
secretary and arrange that the matter be placed on the agenda of the executive
committee. During the course of the committee meeting at which the matter is
discussed, a public hearing shall be conducted on the matter.
   C.   The company representative or its bond counsel shall cause to be
published, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the public hearing,
notice of the meeting at which the public hearing will take place. This meeting
is to serve as the public hearing required for the bond issue under the
internal revenue code.
   D.   The committee meeting should include a discussion of the following
facts regarding the bond issue:
      1.   The general description of the proposed development.
      2.   Nature of the proposed industrial operation.
      3.   Anticipated number of employees.
      4.   Anticipated traffic impact on the municipality.
      5.   The economic benefits to be derived from the project.
      6.   Breakdown of the project costs (including costs attributed to the
land, building and equipment).
      7.   Nature of equipment to be financed, if applicable.
      8.   Credit worthiness of the company seeking bond.
   E.   After hearing the testimony of the company representative and any
parties that may wish to be heard, the executive committee shall then vote to
approve or disapprove of the bond issue.
   F.   1. At the next county board meeting, the board chairman or his designee
shall report his recommendation to the entire board. The county board shall
then vote to approve or disapprove of the bond issue.
      2.   The county board chairman shall then notify the company
representative of the result of the county board vote on the bond issue.
   G.   Once the bond issue is approved by the county board, a memorandum of
agreement and inducement resolution may then be presented to the county board.
These documents are to be prepared by the company representative in conjunction
with the county counsel. The memorandum of agreement and inducement resolution
may be presented at the county board meeting wherein the bond issue is approved
or at the next regularly scheduled county board meeting.
   H.   Once the inducement resolution is passed, commencement of preparation
of the document is authorized.
   I.   In addition to the documents necessary for the bond issue, the company
representative or bond counsel shall prepare a statement for filing with the
internal revenue service to satisfy federal tax requirements.
This document shall be prepared by the date of the final resolution, and
presented at that time for the signature of the county board chairman.
   J.   Once preparation of the necessary documents is completed and the county
counsel has approved of those documents, the bond issue may proceed to closing
and presentation of a final resolution in a scheduled county board meeting.
   K.   Bond issues in which the county is not the issuer but must provide
public approval shall follow the same notice and hearing procedure as described
herein. (Res. 86-37, § I, 3-11-1986; Res. 88-111, 7-12-1988)
2-204: BOND COUNSEL:
A nationally recognized counsel shall be designated as bond counsel. It shall
be the obligation of bond counsel and/or counsel for the company to prepare all
documents. A minimum of fourteen (14) days shall be allowed for review of
documents by the county counsel (copies of any proposed documents must be
delivered to the county counsel's office at least 14 days prior to any
scheduled time for official action or execution of documents).
Typical documents frequently include bond resolution; memorandum of agreement;
lease agreement; deed conveying the land to the issuer; bill of sale conveying
to issuer company's interest in leased facilities; indenture of trust between
issuer and trustee; guarantee agreement between company and trustee; bonds;
resolution of issue authorizing sale of bonds; certificate of counsel of issuer
as to zoning and legislation; corporation certificate of incorporation; current
standing of corporation; documentation of approval of various corporate matters
by appropriate corporate officers; documents furnished by trustee including
authentication of signature identification; certificate of trustee, etc.;
opinions of bond counsel, corporation counsel and counsel for issuer; UCC
financing statements; title insurance policy; survey, arbitrage certificate;
certificate of purchaser. The above are examples of the types of documents
which must be reviewed. The actual documents will vary depending upon each
particular project. (Res. 86-37, § J, 3-11-1986)
2-205: COSTS:
All costs of the industrial revenue bond project shall be borne by the company.
Said costs shall include trustee's expense, bond counsel expenses, corporate
counsel expenses, land surveys, title commitments and recording of documents.
In addition thereto, reasonable county counsel fee shall be paid by the company
for legal services rendered in the review and adoption of the bond issues. Any
additional costs incurred by the county shall be borne by the company. Said

submission requirements at the time it submits its bid to the purchasing
department. Bidder submissions deemed incomplete shall result in a

that the successful bidder shall submit all applicable subcontractor
submissions, as outlined in subsection B(1)(l) prior to the subcontractor
commencing work on the project. Failure of a subcontractor to submit the

work on the project and shall not constitute a contractual default and/or
breach by the successful bidder. However, Kane County shall withhold all
payments otherwise due for work performed by a subcontractor, until the
subcontractor submits the required information and the director of purchasing
approves such information. Where the director of purchasing deems there to be a
non material error in the submission of the required information for a
subcontractor, the director of purchasing can utilize limited discretion in
implementing such withholding requirement. Further, where the director of
purchasing deems necessary, Kane County may also require that the successful
bidder remove the subcontractor from the project and replace it with a
responsive and responsible subcontractor.
   D.   Validity of Pre Qualification Classification:
      1.   Upon designation by the director of purchasing that a bidder’s or
subcontractor’s submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and
upon any further consideration deemed necessary by the director of purchasing,
the bidder or subcontractor may be pre qualified for future Kane County Public
Works projects. A bidder’s classification as “qualified” shall exempt the
bidder or sub contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements
contained herein for a total period of three (3) calendar years. However, Kane
County may ask a bidder to submit additional documents during the time period
in which a bidder is pre qualified. Thereafter, during the three (3) calendar
year period, bidders or subcontractors who are pre qualified must submit a
complete application for continuation of “pre qualified” standing, on a form
provided by the purchasing department, (also referred to as the “short form”)
by December 31st for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any pre qualified
bidder or subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for
continuation of “pre qualified” standing shall result in automatic removal of
the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year. However, the
“removed” bidder or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on Kane
County Public Works projects. Kane County may establish rules permitting
bidder’s to be pre qualified outside of the bidding process.
      2.   Any material changes to the bidder’s status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days of its occurrence to the
purchasing department. The pre qualification designation is solely within the
discretion of the director of purchasing and Kane County specifically reserves
the right to change or revoke the designation for a stated written reason(s).
      3.   Denial of pre qualification shall be in writing and shall be
forwarded to the bidder within seven (7) calendar days of such decision. Any
bidder denied or losing pre qualification status may request reconsideration of
the decision by submitting such request in writing to the director of
purchasing within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notice of denial.
   E.   Lowest Bidder Not Chosen:
      1.   When the award is not recommended to be given to the lowest bidder,
a statement of the reason for such recommendation shall be prepared by the
purchasing department.
      2.   In the event that there are no bidders pursuant to the Responsible
Bidder Ordinance, Kane County may pursue bidders pursuant to the standard
provisions otherwise set out by the Kane County Purchasing Ordinance.
   F.   Multiple Low Bids: When two or more responsible bidders submit the same
low bid, the contract award shall be determined by drawing lots at a public
meeting.
   G.   Public Records: All information submitted by a successful bidder
pursuant to this Ordinance are public records subject to review pursuant to the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq.).
   H.   Materiality: The requirements of this Ordinance are a material part of
the bid documents and the contract and the successful bidder shall insert this
Ordinance in all subcontracts.
   I.   Severability: If any portion of this Ordinance or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall
not affect other portions or applications of this Ordinance which can be given
effect without the invalid portions or applications and, to this end, the
portions of this Ordinance are severable.
   J.   Other Ordinances: Any prior ordinance or portion thereof in conflict
with this Ordinance is superseded by the requirements of this Ordinance. Where
this Ordinance is silent, Kane County may adhere to the requirements laid out
in the Kane County Purchasing Ordinance.

      6.   To impose penalties consistent with applicable code provisions and
to assess costs reasonably related to instituting the proceedings upon finding
the respondent liable for the charged violation. In no event, however, shall
the hearing officer have the authority to impose a penalty of incarceration.
(Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-324: PROCEDURE FOR INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS:
   A.   When a code enforcement officer observes a code violation, the officer
shall note, or in the case of an animal control violation, the code enforcement
officer may respond to the filing of a formal complaint by noting the violation
on a violation notice and report form, indicating the following: the name and
address of the respondent, if known; the name, address, and vehicle
registration number of the waste hauler who deposited the waste, if applicable;
the type and nature of the violation; the date and time the violation was
observed; the names of witnesses to the violation; and the address of the
location or property where the violation is observed.
   B.   The violation notice and report form shall contain a file number and a
hearing date noted by the code enforcement officer in the spaces provided for
that purpose on the form. The violation notice and report form shall state that
failure to appear at the hearing on the date indicated may result in a
determination of liability for the cited violation and the imposition of fines
and assessment of costs as provided by the applicable county ordinance. The
violation notice and report form shall also state that upon a determination of
liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust procedures for judicial
review, any unpaid fines or costs imposed will constitute a debt due and owed
to the county.
   C.   The code enforcement officer shall certify the correctness of the
information required by subsection A of this section by signing his name to the
violation notice and report form, and indicate the date on which this was done.
Failure to certify does not invalidate the violation notice, but will not
establish a prima facie case at trial.
   D.   A copy of the violation notice and report form shall be filed with the
code hearing unit and served on the respondent either personally or by first
class mail, postage prepaid, sent to the address of the respondent. If the name
of the respondent property owner cannot be ascertained or if the service on the
respondent cannot be made by mail, service may be made on the respondent
property owner by posting, not less than twenty (20) days before the hearing is
scheduled, a copy of the violation notice and report form in a prominent place
on the property where the violation was found. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-325: NOTICE OF HEARING; SUBPOENAS; DEFAULT:
   A.   The respondent shall have at least twenty (20) days after service of
the violation notice and report form to prepare for the hearing, unless the
violation is deemed by the code enforcement officer to be an immediate threat
to the public health, safety, or welfare, at which time the hearing date may be
expedited as necessary.
   B.   All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for
hearing. For good cause shown, a continuance may be granted at the discretion
of the hearing officer. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a
continuance. Continuances shall not exceed twenty eight (28) days.
   C.   At any time prior to the hearing date, at the request of the code
enforcement officer, the attorney for the county, the respondent, or the
attorney for the respondent, the hearing officer assigned to hear the case may
issue subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give testimony at the
hearing.
   D.   If, at the time set for hearing, the respondent or his attorney fails
to appear, the hearing officer shall proceed with the hearing and accept
evidence relating to the existence of a code violation. At the close of the
hearing, upon sufficient evidence of a violation, the hearing officer may enter
a default judgment of liability against the respondent and impose fines and
assess costs. A copy of the order of default shall be served promptly in any
manner for service of a notice of violation permitted by this article and
applicable to the violation. A copy of the default judgment, which is a final
determination, shall apprise the respondent of the procedure for setting aside
the default judgment and also shall apprise the respondent of the availability
of an appeal of the default judgment to the circuit court of Kane County.
   E.   A respondent against whom a default judgment has been entered may file
a motion with the code enforcement unit to set aside the default judgment and
for a new hearing. A motion to set aside a default judgment may be filed within
twenty eight (28) days of entry of the default judgment. A motion to set aside
a default judgment shall set forth the reason(s) the respondent failed to
appear on the original hearing date. The motion will be heard and ruled upon by
the code hearing officer. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-326: REPRESENTATION AT HEARINGS:
The case for the county may be presented by the code enforcement officer or by
the state's attorney. In no event, however, may the case for the county be
presented by an employee of the code hearing unit. The case for the respondent
may be presented by the respondent or the respondent's attorney. If the
respondent is a corporation, it may appear through any officer, director,
manager, or supervisor of the corporation. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-327: CONDUCT OF HEARINGS:
The hearing officer shall preside at the hearing, shall hear testimony, and
shall accept any evidence relevant to the existence or nonexistence of a code
violation on the property indicated. The code enforcement officer's signed
violation notice and report form shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
of the code violation described in the form. The strict rules of evidence
applicable to judicial proceedings do not apply to hearings authorized under
this article. The burden of proof is a preponderance of the evidence. Once a
prima facie case is established by the county, the burden of proof then shifts
to the respondent. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-328: FINDINGS, DETERMINATION, AND ORDER:
At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make a
determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing as to
whether a code violation exists. The determination shall be in writing and
shall be designated as the hearing officer's findings, decision, and order. The
findings, decision, and order shall include the hearing officer's findings of
fact, a determination of whether a code violation exists based on the findings
of fact, and an order imposing a fine or other penalty, directing the
respondent to correct the violation, or dismissing the case if the violation is
not proved. If the hearing officer determines that the respondent is liable for
the cited violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order imposing
sanctions that are provided in the code for the violations proved, including
the imposition of fines and the recovery of the costs of the proceedings. Costs
may be recovered in the same manner as fines and penalties. A copy of the
findings, decision, and order shall be served by personal service or by any
method provided for service of the violation notice and report form under
section 2-324 of this chapter. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-329: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW:
The findings, decision, and order of the hearing officer shall be subject to
review in the circuit court of Kane County. The administrative review law 1
and the rules adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to and govern every action
for the judicial review of the final findings, decision, and order of a hearing
officer under this section. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
 
Notes

2-330: TRANSFER OR CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY:
The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the county
against a respondent property owner as the result of a finding of a code
violation under this article shall attach to the property, subject to the
interests of all lienholders of record, as well as to the owner of the
property, so that the owner cannot avoid the finding of a code violation
against the owner by conveying or transferring the property to another. Any
subsequent transferee or owner of property takes the property subject to the
findings, decision, and order of a hearing officer under this article if a
notice consisting of a copy of the order to correct a code violation and
imposing any sanctions and costs, if applicable, and a description of the real
estate affected that is sufficient to identify the real estate has been filed
in the office of the Kane County recorder by the county prior to the transfer
or conveyance to the subsequent transferee or owner. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)
2-331: COLLECTION OF UNPAID FINES OR OTHER SANCTIONS:
   A.   Any fine or other sanction or costs imposed, or any part of any fine or
other sanction or costs imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or
failure to exhaust procedures for judicial review under the administrative
review law 1  is a debt due and owed to Kane County and, as such, may be
collected in accordance with applicable law. Any subsequent owner or transferee
of property takes subject to this debt if a notice has been filed pursuant to
section 2-330 of this chapter.
   B.   After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the
administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code
violation, the county may commence a proceeding in the circuit court of Kane
County for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the hearing officer's findings,
decision, and order, by filing a petition. Nothing in this article prevents the
county from consolidating multiple findings, decisions, and orders against a
person or property in such a proceeding.
   C.   Upon commencement of the action, the county shall file a certified copy
of the findings, decision, and order, which shall be accompanied by a
certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the findings,
decision, and order were issued in accordance with this article and 55 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/5-41 et seq. Service of the summons and a copy of the
petition may be by any method provided by section 2-203 of the code of civil
procedure 2  or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the
total amount of fines or other sanctions and costs imposed by the findings,
decision, and order does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).
   D.   If the court is satisfied that the findings, decision, and order were
entered within the requirements of 55 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5-41 et
seq., and this article, and that the respondent had an opportunity for a
hearing under and for judicial review as provided in 55 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/5-41 et seq.:
      1.   The court shall render judgment in favor of the county and against
the respondent for the amount indicated in the findings, decision, and order
plus court costs. The judgment has the same effect and may be enforced in the
same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
      2.   The court may issue other orders or injunctions, or both, requested
by the county to enforce the order of the hearing officer or to correct a code
violation. (Ord. 15-159, 6-9-2015)

2-345: Liability

2-340: INTRODUCTION:
Public act 096-0176 amended the Illinois power agreement act by adding section
1-92 to 20 Illinois Compiled Statutes 3855 ("the act") and allowed the
corporate authorities of a county to adopt an ordinance in accordance with the
act to aggregate electrical loads for residential and small commercial retail
customers within the corporate limits of the county on an opt-out or opt-in
program. The act further authorized a county to select suppliers of retail
electric supply, solicit bids and enter into service agreements to facilitate
the sale and purchase of electricity and related services. The legislation
authorized the Illinois power agency to assist a county in developing a plan of
operation and governance.
Large industrial and commercial consumers with sophisticated electric
operations use their size and expertise to obtain lower electric power rates.
Individual residential and small commercial retail consumers are typically
unable to obtain significant price reductions since they lack the same
bargaining power, expertise and the economies of scale enjoyed by larger
consumers. Aggregation, the combining of multiple electric loads, provides the
benefits of retail electric competition for consumers with lower electric
usage.
Municipal aggregation, the combining of multiple retail electric loads of
customers by a county, provides the means through which municipal residential
and small commercial retail customers may obtain economic benefits of Illinois'
competitive retail electric market. The Kane County aggregation program
combines the electric loads of residential and small commercial retail
customers to form a buying group ("aggregation group"). Kane County ("county"
or "Kane County") will act as purchasing agent for the aggregation group.
Therefore, Kane County will be a municipal or governmental aggregator, as
described by Illinois law and the rules established by authorized agencies, and
shall act on behalf of Commonwealth Edison Company, an affiliate of Exelon
Corporation (herein referred to as "ComEd" or "Commonwealth Edison") in the
county to obtain the best aggregation program for the members of the
aggregation group. (Ord. 14-234, 8-12-2014)
2-341: PROCESS:
On March 18, 2014, in accordance with the requirements of the act,
unincorporated Kane County voters (exception of the residents in Aurora and
Dundee Townships) approved a referendum to operate an aggregation program as an
"opt-out" program. Under the opt-out program, all ComEd residential and small
commercial retail customers in the county are automatically included as
participants in the program unless they opt out of the program by providing
written notice of their intention not to participate as a part of the
aggregation group. As required by state law, the corporate authorities ("Kane
County board" or "county board") of the county of Kane, Illinois ("county or
"Kane County"), duly passed an ordinance which authorized submitting to the
county's electorate the determination whether or not the aggregation program
shall operate as an opt-out program. Following the approval of the referendum
by the electorate, the county passed ordinance 2014-234 on August 12, 2014,
authorizing the county to aggregate electric loads for residential and small
commercial retail customers in unincorporated Kane County and implement an opt-
out program.
In addition to passing the required ordinances by the county board, the county
may also be required to comply with various rules and regulations established
by authorized agencies of the state of Illinois. The county will promptly file
any application and comply with any applicable rules and regulations that may
be required by Illinois law for certification as a municipal aggregator and to
operate the aggregation program under the act. As required by the act, the
county board developed and approved this aggregation plan of operation and
governance ("plan"). Before adopting this plan and as required by the act, the
county board duly published a notice of two (2) public hearings in the Kane
County Chronicle, a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The first
public hearing was held on Tuesday, June 24, 2014, at five fifteen o'clock (5:
15) P.M. at the Kane County Government Center, Kane County board room (719 S.
Batavia Avenue, Geneva, IL 60134) and the second public hearing was held on
Wednesday, June 25, 2014, at seven o'clock (7:00) P.M. at Fishermen's Inn
(43W901 Main Street Road, Elburn, IL 60119). The public hearings were held by
the county board and provided the residents of the county a meaningful
opportunity to be heard regarding the aggregation program and this plan. The
county board considered the concerns of the residents and information disclosed
at the hearings in the development of this plan. The opt-out notice for the
aggregation program shall be provided in advance to all eligible electric
customers in the county upon approval of this plan according to the opt-out
disclosure program developed by the county. The opt-out notice and disclosures
shall comply with the act and all applicable rules and regulations of any
authorized agency in the state of Illinois and shall fully inform such
customers in advance that they have the right to opt out of the aggregation
program. The opt-out notice shall disclose all required information including,
but not limited to, the rates, terms and conditions of the program and the
specific method to opt out of the program.
By majority vote of the county board, the county may select a retail electric
supplier ("RES" or "provider") to provide the electric power for the Kane
County aggregation program according to the terms of a written service
agreement entered into by and between the provider and the county. By majority
vote of the county board, the county may determine not to enter into a service
agreement with any provider and in such event the aggregation group shall
continue to purchase electric power through Commonwealth Edison. If the county
board enters into a service agreement with a provider, Commonwealth Edison will
continue to provide and service delivery of the electricity purchased from the
provider, and metering, repairs and emergency service will continue to be
provided by Commonwealth Edison. The county board has determined that each
participant in the aggregation group shall receive a single monthly bill from
Commonwealth Edison under applicable tariffs. (Ord. 14-234, 8-12-2014)
2-342: DEFINITIONS:
In order to clarify certain terminology, the following terms as used in this
plan shall have the meanings set forth below:
AGGREGATION GROUP: All the residential and small commercial retail customers of
ComEd in the corporate limits of the county that have not opted out of the
program and are permitted under the terms of the act to participate in the
program.
AGGREGATION PROGRAM OR PROGRAM: The program developed and implemented by Kane
County, as a municipal aggregator under the act, to provide ComEd residential
and small commercial retail customers in the county with retail electric
generation services.
MEMBER: A person or legal entity enrolled in the Kane County municipal
aggregation program for competitive retail electric services and a member of
the aggregation group.
MUNICIPAL AGGREGATOR: The county operating an aggregation program under the
legislative authority granted the county to act as an aggregator to provide a
competitive retail electric service to residential and small commercial retail
customers of ComEd in the county. Pursuant to the act, an aggregator is not a
public utility or an alternative retail electric supplier.
RETAIL ELECTRIC SUPPLIER (RES OR PROVIDER): An entity certified by all required
authorities of the state of Illinois to provide competitive retail electric
supply service(s), and which is duly selected by the county to be the entity
responsible to provide the required retail electrical supply service related to
an aggregation program as defined in the act, county ordinances and applicable
rules and regulations of any authorized agency of the state of Illinois and has
duly executed a power supply agreement with the county. (Ord. 14-234, 8-12-
2014)
2-343: OPERATIONAL PLAN:
   A.   Aggregation Services:
      1.   Provider: Kane County will use a competent entity as a provider to
perform and manage aggregation services for members of the aggregation program.
The provider shall provide adequate, accurate, and understandable pricing,
terms and conditions of service, including, but not limited to, no switching
fees and the conditions under which a member may opt out without penalty. The
provider must provide the county, upon request, an electronic file containing
the members' usage, charges for retail supply service and such other
information reasonably requested by the county.
      2.   Database: The retail electric supplier shall create and maintain a
secure database of all members. The database will include the name, address,
Commonwealth Edison account number, and retail electric suppliers' account
number of each active member, and other pertinent information such as rate
code, rider code (if applicable), most recent twelve (12) months of usage and
demand, and meter reading cycle. The database will be updated at least
quarterly. Accordingly, the provider will develop and implement a program to
accommodate members who: a) leave the aggregation group due to relocation,
opting out, etc.; b) decide to join the aggregation group; c) relocate anywhere
within the corporate limits of the county; or d) move into the county and elect
to join the aggregation group. This database shall also be capable of removing
a member from the aggregation group who has duly opted out of the program. The
provider will use this database to perform audits for clerical and mathematical
accuracy of member electric supply bills. The provider will make the database
available to the county at any time the county requests it.
      3.   Member Education: The provider shall develop and implement, with the
assistance of the county, as the county may determine in its sole discretion,
an educational program that generally explains the aggregation program to all
residential and small commercial retail customers in the county and the
aggregation group, provides updates and disclosures mandated by Illinois law
and applicable rules and regulations, and implements a process to allow any
member the opportunity to opt out of the aggregation program according to the
terms of the power supply agreement. See appendix A below for further details.
         a.   Appendix A -- Education Process: The provider shall develop the
educational program in conjunction with the county. Its purpose will be to
explain the aggregation program to its members, provide updates and disclosures
as mandated by state law and the rules and regulations of any applicable
Illinois agency, and provide the opportunity for the members to opt out of the
aggregation program. The following are components of the education program:
            (1)   Each residential and small commercial retail customer of
ComEd within the corporate limits of the county will receive notification by
U.S. mail stating: what the municipal aggregation program means, the procedure
which must be followed to opt out of the aggregation program, the estimated
price of electricity for members of the aggregation program, and the deadline
for returning the opt-out form. See "draft sample letter" below.
   "DRAFT SAMPLE LETTER"
Dear Unincorporated Kane County Resident,
County of Kane is providing you the opportunity to join other residents to save
money on the electricity you use. Savings are possible through governmental
aggregation, where County officials bring together citizens to gain group
buying power for the purchase of electricity from a retail electric generation
provider certified by the Public Illinois Utilities Commission. County of Kane
voters approved this program on March 18, 2014.
After researching competitive electricity pricing options for you, we have
chosen                    , to provide you with savings on your electric
generation through August 1, 2015. There is no cost for enrollment and you will
not be charged a switching fee. You do not need to do anything to participate.
As a member of this aggregation, you are guaranteed to save     percent off
your Price to Compare. Your Price to Compare is essentially the price you pay
for electric generation from the utility and consists of generation and
transmission related components, which are the costs associated with generating
the power and delivering it through the transmission system.
To estimate what your savings per kilowatt-hour (KWH) will be through this
program, locate your Price to Compare on your electric bill. Divide your Price
to Compare by 100, then multiply by 0.0   (    %) to determine your savings per
KWH. Multiply that number by your total monthly usage. The final number is how
much you can expect to save each month you use the same amount of electricity.
You will see your electric savings from                  after your enrollment
has been completed and your switch has been finalized - approximately 30 - 45
days, depending upon your meter read date. Of course, you are not obligated to
participate in the County of Kane's electric governmental aggregation program.
If you wish to be excluded from the program and remain a full-service customer
of your local electric utility - Commonwealth Edison - you have until         ,
2014 to return the attached "opt-out" form. If you do not opt out at this time,
you will receive a notice at least every            asking if you wish to
remain in the program. If you leave the program at any other time, you could be
subject to a cancellation fee from                   - and you might not be
served under the same rates, terms and conditions that apply to other customers
served by Commonwealth Edison.
After you become a participant in this governmental aggregation program,
Commonwealth Edison will send you a letter confirming your selection of
           as your electric generation provider. As required by law, this
letter will inform you of your option to rescind your enrollment with
             with adequate notice prior to the scheduled switch. To remain in
the County's governmental aggregation program, you don't need to take any
action when this letter arrives.
Commonwealth Edison will continue to maintain the system that delivers power to
your home - no new poles or wires will be built by                . You will
continue to receive a single, easy-to-read bill from your local electric
utility with your                 charges included. The only thing you'll
notice is savings.
If you have any questions, please call                toll-free at           ,
Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Please do not call the County of Kane with aggregation program questions.
Sincerely,
County of Kane               
P.S. To receive these savings, you should not respond. Return the opt-out form
only if you do not want to participate in the County's electric governmental
aggregation program.

and according to the retail tariffs of Commonwealth Edison.
   E.   Changes, Extension Or Renewal Of Service: The power supply agreement

the aggregation group will be allowed to switch to a different electric
supplier after the expiration of the opt-out period on the terms set forth in
the power supply agreement but at least shall be allowed to opt out every three
(3) years. Requirements for notification of intent to opt out of the
aggregation group shall be set forth in the power supply agreement. Consumers
who opt out of the aggregation group will not be switched from their current
supplier or their applicable provider to ComEd's standard service offer, until
the consumer selects an alternate generation supplier. As required by the act,
it shall be the duty of the county or the provider if so provided in the power
supply agreement, to fully inform residential and small commercial retail
customers in the county in advance that they have the right to opt out of the
aggregation program. Such disclosure shall prominently state any charges to be
made and shall include full disclosure of the cost to obtain service pursuant
to section 16-103 of the public utilities act, how to access it, and the fact
that it is available to them without penalty, if they are currently receiving
services under that section. As further required by the act, the Illinois power
agency shall furnish, without charge, to any resident of the county, a list of
all supply options available to them in a format that allows comparison of
prices and products.
   I.   Bid Process: The county may elect to hold an individual bid or
participate in a group bid. If the county elects to participate in a group bid,
the county may use an energy aggregation consultant to assist with the group
bid. The county will not delegate any signing authority to the energy
aggregation consultant or other entity, but will make its own decision to
accept or reject their individual bid resulting from the group bid. Suppliers
will present individual bids to each community participating in the bid group.
The county may create an advisory group, representing and consisting of those
communities participating in the bid, to determine the bid winner(s) on the day
of the bid. The energy aggregation consultant working with the Kane County
purchasing department will then recommend accepting or rejecting the bid
winner's individual bid for the county. The county will then decide to accept
or reject their individual bid. Whether or not each community participating in
the bid accepts or rejects their individual bid will have no impact upon the
individual bids of the other communities. (Ord. 14-234, 8-12-2014)

2.5-0: PURPOSE:
The County of Kane hereby declares false alarms to be a public nuisance
prejudicial to the general health, safety, and welfare of the public. The Kane
County Sheriff's Office responds to numerous false alarms each year. Many of
these false alarms are from repeat offenders. Responding to such alarms exposes
the officers and public to the dangers associated with emergency responses and
wastes valuable resources of the Kane County Sheriff's Office. The purpose of
this chapter is to ensure that citizens residing in unincorporated Kane County
register their alarm systems and take necessary measures to prevent false
alarms. (Ord. 17-226, 8-8-2017)
2.5-1: DEFINITIONS:
ADJUDICATION OFFICER: An attorney, appointed by the Sheriff and approved by the
County Board that conducts adjudication hearings for the purpose of collecting
outstanding fees and/or fines relating to this chapter.
ALARM ADMINISTRATOR: A person or persons designated by the Kane County Sheriff,
or his designee, to administer, control, and review false alarm reduction
efforts and administer the provisions of this chapter.
ALARM COMPANY: Any person subject to licensing requirements, or a company
engaged in selling, leasing, installing, servicing, or monitoring alarm
systems. This person shall be licensed and in compliance with State, County,
and city laws.
ALARM PERMIT APPLICATION: Authorization or consent by the Kane County Sheriff's
Office for the installation of an alarm system.
ALARM PERMIT NUMBER: An alarm permit number or authorization code may be issued
during the application permit process by the Sheriff's Office allowing for the
operation of an alarm system within the County of Kane.
ALARM SIGNAL: A detectable signal; audible or visual, generated by an alarm
system, to which law enforcement is requested to respond.
ALARM SYSTEM: Any signal device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the
occurrence of an illegal or unauthorized entry or other activity requiring
immediate attention to which law enforcement is requested to respond.
ALARM USER: Any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental,
or educational entity or any other entity owning, leasing, or operating an
alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the
protection of such premises.

CANCELLATION: The process when response is terminated, and the alarm company
(designated by the alarm user) notifies the Sheriff's Office that there is no
existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm
dispatch request. If cancellation occurs prior to police arriving at the scene,
this is not a false alarm for the purpose of a fine, and no penalty will be
assessed.
COUNTY: The County of Kane, Illinois, or its agent.
CYCLE RENEWAL, PERMIT: The permit application is valid for a period of one year
beginning January 1, and ending on December 31.
FALSE ALARM: The activation or transmission of an alarm signal through
mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the
negligence of the alarm user, his or her employee(s) or agent(s), or signal
activated to summon law enforcement personnel, unless law enforcement response
was cancelled by the alarm user's alarm company before law enforcement
personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of
this definition when, upon inspection by the Sheriff's Office and/or deputy,
that evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such
crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises, which would have
activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
false alarm will not include an alarm, which can reasonably be determined to
have been caused, or activated by unusually violent conditions of nature nor
does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to
control by the alarm user.
FALSE ALARM NOTIFICATION: An alarm notification to central station/dispatch
when the responding Kane County Sheriff's Deputy finds, through inspection of
the interior and/or exterior of the alarm site, no evidence of an attempted or
actual unauthorized intrusion, burglary, robbery, or hostage taking, and the
deputy(ies) has responded.
HEARING OFFICER: A person or persons designated by the Kane County Sheriff, or
his designee, to administer, control, and review false alarm reduction efforts,

discretion discontinue police responses to alarm signals from what appears to
be a runaway alarm. The Alarm Administrator may consider all false alarm
dispatches within a twenty four (24) hour period as one false alarm and invoice
the alarm user accordingly.
SIA CONTROL PANEL STANDARD CP-01: The American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) approved Security Industry Association (SIA) CP-01 Control Panel
Standard, as may be updated from time to time, that details recommended design
features for security system control panels and their associated arming and
disarming devices to reduce false alarms. Control panels built and tested to

VERIFY: An attempt by the alarm company, or its representative, to contact the
alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone and/or other electronic means,
whether or not actual contact with a person is made, in attempt to determine
whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law enforcement dispatch, in
an attempt to avoid unnecessary alarm dispatch request. For the purpose of this
chapter, telephone verification shall require, as a minimum, that a second call
also known as enhanced call verification, be made to a different number if the
first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify themselves
to attempt to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting law
enforcement dispatch. (Ord. 17-226, 8-8-2017)

causing the alarm system to activate upon restoration of power, as evidenced by
written documentation by their provider;
      4.   An alarm dispatch request, that is cancelled by the alarm company,
prior to the arrival of an officer(s), is not considered a false alarm.

failure to register and obtain or renew a permit application may result in no
law enforcement response to an unregistered alarm site.
   E.   Written Notice Of Suspension: A written notice of suspension of law
enforcement response will be mailed via U.S. registered postal mail to the
alarm user, suspending service effective thirty (30) days after payment was

TAGS; SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE:
   A.   Registration: Every owner of a dog or cat four (4) months or more of
age shall cause such dog or cat to be registered with, and shall pay a
registration fee to, Kane County animal control. Upon payment of the required
registration fee and compliance with the rabies inoculation requirement set
forth in subsection B of this section, a registration tag shall be issued and
will be valid for one year. Every dog or cat shall be registered annually,
unless a licensed veterinarian has issued a certificate indicating that a three
(3) year rabies vaccine has been administered to the dog or cat, in which case,
registration shall be once every three (3) years. This requirement of
registration may be satisfied through the inoculation and tag purchase
described in subsection B of this section.
   B.   Inoculation: Every owner of a dog or cat four (4) months or more of age
shall cause such dog or cat to be inoculated against rabies by a licensed
veterinarian. Every dog or cat shall have a second rabies vaccination within
one year of the first vaccination and every year thereafter. However, if the
vaccine used is one recognized by the Illinois department of agriculture for a
three (3) year period of immunity, and the dog or cat is over twelve (12)
months of age at the time of inoculation, the interval between inoculations may
be extended to three (3) years. Evidence of such rabies inoculation shall be
entered on a certificate, the form of which shall be approved by the Kane
County board and which shall contain the microchip number of the animal, if it
has one, and which shall be signed by the licensed veterinarian administering
the vaccine. Veterinarians who inoculate a dog or cat shall procure from Kane
County animal control serially numbered tags, one to be issued with each
inoculation certificate. Only one dog or cat shall be included on each
certificate. The veterinarian immunizing or microchipping an animal in Kane
County shall provide the administrator of Kane County animal control with a
certificate of immunization and microchip number, and a tag shall be issued, at
a fee established by the Kane County board for each dog or cat inoculated
against rabies. Such tags shall also serve as the registration tag for purposes
of this chapter. Tags shall be worn on the collar or harness of the animal for
which the tag and rabies inoculation certificate was issued, except when the
animal is confined.
If a tag is not issued at the time a dog or cat is inoculated against rabies
(for example, if the owner refuses to obtain the tag from the veterinarian or
if the veterinarian is located outside Kane County), the owner must register
the dog or cat with Kane County animal control within thirty (30) days of
inoculation. In which case, the owner must present an inoculation certificate
issued by the veterinarian that administered such inoculation. Kane County
animal control will then furnish the owner with a tag, upon payment of the
registration fee.
   C.   Registration Fee: The fee for a registration tag shall be assessed at a
rate set forth by Kane County animal control and approved by the county board
and shall include a minimum ten dollar ($10.00) differential in the fee for
dogs or cats that have not been spayed or neutered.
   D.   Sale And Distribution Of Vaccine: Rabies vaccine for use on animals
shall be sold or distributed only to and used only by licensed veterinarians.
Such rabies vaccine shall be licensed by the United States department of
agriculture and approved by the Illinois department of agriculture.
   E.   Exemptions: If a licensed veterinarian determines in writing that a
rabies inoculation would compromise an animal's health, then the animal shall
be exempt from the rabies shot requirement, but the owner must register the dog
or cat as medically exempt within thirty (30) days after such determination.
(Ord. 12-288, 9-11-2012)
5-8-1: CHANGE OF PET OWNERSHIP:

of a dog or cat, which has been previously registered with Kane County during
the course of the same calendar year.
   C.   Change of ownership may be proven by a bill of sale, evidence of the
previous registration and/or letter from the previous owner relinquishing
ownership of the pet. (Ord. 04-83, 2-10-2004)

at large or straying in any incorporated or unincorporated area of Kane County
contrary to provisions of this chapter may be apprehended and impounded. It
shall be the duty of the Kane County animal control administrator to impound
any dog not under immediate control of its owner, or the owner's agent, found
straying or running at large within the corporate limits of the county of Kane,
but outside the limits of any municipality. Upon a written report, owners of

ABATEMENT:
It shall be unlawful for any owner or other person to allow their dog or other
animal to bark, howl, cry, whine, or otherwise emit loud noises day or night so
as to disturb the peace or quiet of any person, place or neighborhood or family
in any incorporated or unincorporated area of Kane County while said dog or
other animal is not within the confines of the owner's residence or other
enclosed building upon the owner's property. Any dog or other animal emitting
such noises shall be deemed and considered to be a public nuisance. Any person
who shall fail, neglect or refuse to abate such nuisance after notice thereof,
shall, for each twenty four (24) hours thereafter during which said nuisance
continues, be deemed to have committed a separate violation of this section and
be subject to like penalty as that originally incurred.
Any county law enforcement officer or designated deputy enforcing officer, upon
observing any violation of this section, shall issue a notice directed to the
owner of the animal, which said notice shall describe the violation and shall
establish a reasonable time limit for the abatement thereof by such owner,
which time shall be not less than one day nor more than ten (10) days after
service of such notice.
Immediately upon the termination of the time allowed in any such notice for the
abatement of such nuisance, the law enforcement officer or deputy enforcing
officer who served such notice or any other law enforcement officer who shall
be assigned by the animal control administrator or sheriff shall investigate to
determine whether or not such nuisance has been abated.
In the event the owner of the animal has failed within the prescribed time to
abate such nuisance, the citizen of the county of Kane who filed the original
affidavit may file a complaint with the circuit court, charging violation of
this section and demanding that the owner be punished as herein provided.
The court may, at its discretion, use whatever means that are necessary to
abate the nuisance including, but not limited to, ordering the humane
destruction of said animal causing the nuisance. (Ord. 04-83, 2-10-2004)
5-9-4: NUISANCE FEEDING PROHIBITED:

2004)
5-10: NOTICE OF IMPOUNDMENT; SERVICE OF NOTICE; REDEMPTION OF IMPOUNDED DOG;
CONDITIONS:
When dogs or cats or other animals are apprehended and impounded by the
administrator, they must be scanned for the presence of a microchip. The
department shall give notice of not less than seven (7) business days to the
owner, if known, prior to disposal of the animal. Such notice shall be phoned
to the owner or mailed or delivered to the last known address of the owner. An
affidavit or testimony of the administrator, or his authorized agent, who
phones, mails or delivers such notice shall be prima facie evidence of the
receipt of such notice by the owner of such animal. In case the owner of any
impounded animal desires to make redemption thereof, he or she may do so on the
following conditions:
   A.   Present proof of current rabies inoculation, and registration, if
applicable, or
   B.   Pay for the rabies inoculation of the dog or cat, and registration, if
applicable, and
   C.   Pay for dog to be microchipped. If not redeemed by owner, dog must be
microchipped before adoption, and

period it was impounded, and
   E.   Pay into the animal control fund an additional impoundment fee as
prescribed by the board as a penalty for the first offense and for each
subsequent offense.
This shall be in addition to any other penalties invoked under this chapter. If
the owner is not known because the animal has no means of identification
readily and easily recognizable by the department, the impounded animal shall
be held for five (5) business days. In any case where said animal is injured or
sick, whether the owner is known or not, the licensed veterinarian examining
said animal shall have the right to shorten the period of impoundment to
whatever period he shall deem necessary in order to alleviate the animal's
suffering or to prevent the spread of contagious disease. (Ord. 04-83, 2-10-

other reason, if applicable, in accordance with the provisions of this section
shall be humanely dispatched, offered for adoption, or otherwise disposed of by
the pound as a stray animal in accordance with laws that exist or may hereafter
exist. An animal pound or animal shelter shall not release any dog or cat when
not redeemed by the owner unless the animal has been surgically rendered
incapable of reproduction by spaying or neutering and microchipped, or the
person wishing to adopt an animal prior to the surgical procedure and
microchipping having been performed shall have executed a written agreement
promising to have such service performed within thirty (30) days. Failure to
fulfill the terms of the agreement shall result in seizure and impoundment of
the animal by the animal pound or shelter, and any monies which have been
deposited shall be forfeited. This section shall not prevent humane societies
from engaging in activities set forth by their charters; provided, they are not
inconsistent with provisions of this chapter and other existing laws. No animal
shelter or pound shall release dogs or cats to an individual representing a
rescue group unless the group has been licensed by the Illinois department of

supervision of a licensed veterinarian for a period of at least ten (10) days.
Any animal in direct contact with such animal, whether or not the exposed
animal has been inoculated against rabies, shall be confined as ordered by the

5-13: REPORT OF BITE BY AN ANIMAL; CONFINEMENT; REPORT; NOTIFICATION BY

of ten (10) days. Such veterinarian shall report the clinical condition of the
animal immediately, with confirmation in writing to the administrator within
twenty four (24) hours after the animal is presented for examination, giving
the owner's name, address, the date of confinement, the breed, description,
age, and sex of such animal, on appropriate forms approved by the department.

agency if the biting animal has not been presented for confinement. At the end
of the confinement period, the veterinarian shall submit a written report to
the administrator advising him of the final disposition of such animal on

such animal was inoculated against rabies within the time prescribed by law, it
may be confined in the house of its owner, or in a manner which will prohibit
it from biting any person for a period of ten (10) days, if the administrator,
or other licensed veterinarian, adjudges such confinement satisfactory. At the
end of the confinement period, such animal shall be examined by a licensed
veterinarian.
It is unlawful for any person having knowledge that any person has been bitten
by an animal to refuse to notify the administrator promptly. It is unlawful for
the owner of such animal to euthanize, sell, give away, or otherwise dispose of
any such animal known to have bitten a person, until it is released by the
administrator, or his authorized representative. It is unlawful for the owner
of such animal to refuse or fail to comply with the written or printed
instructions made by the administrator, or his authorized representative. If
such instructions cannot be delivered in person, they shall be mailed to the
owner of such animal by regular mail, postage prepaid. The affidavit or
testimony of the administrator, or his authorized representative, delivering or
mailing such instructions is prima facie evidence that the owner of such animal
was notified of his or her responsibilities. Any expense incurred in the
handling of an animal under this section and section 5-12 of this chapter shall
be borne by the owner. For the purpose of this section, the word "immediately"
means by telephone, in person, or by other than use of the mail.
When a person has been bitten by a police dog, the police dog may continue to
perform its duties for the peace officer or law enforcement agency and any
period of observation of the police dog may be under the supervision of a peace
officer. However, the police dog must remain under the constant supervision of
its police handler. (Ord. 04-83, 2-10-2004)

DIVISION 1. VICIOUS ANIMALS
5-15: ENCLOSURE FOR VICIOUS DOG OR OTHER ANIMAL; LEASH FOR DANGEROUS DOG OR
OTHER ANIMAL; EXEMPTIONS; INJUNCTION; NUISANCE:
In order for a dog or other animal to be deemed "vicious", the administrator,
deputy administrator, animal control warden, or law enforcement officer must
give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the
owner, conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the
owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or
behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the
dog or other animal is a vicious animal and give the report to the state's
attorney's office and the owner. The administrator, state's attorney, or any
other citizen of Kane County may file a complaint in the circuit court in the
name of the people of the state of Illinois to deem a dog or other animal to be
a vicious animal. Testimony of a certified animal behaviorist may be relevant
to the court's determination of whether the dog's or other animal's behavior
was justified. The petitioner must prove the animal is a vicious animal by
clear and convincing evidence. The administrator shall determine where the
animal shall be confined during the pendency of the case.
A dog or other animal shall not be declared vicious if the court determines the
conduct of the dog or other animal was justified because:
   A.   The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the time
was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog or
other animal, or upon the property of the owner or custodian of the dog or
other animal;
   B.   The injured, threatened, or killed person was tormenting, abusing,
assaulting, or physically threatened the dog or other animal or its offspring;
or
   C.   The dog or other animal was responding to pain or injury, or was
protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or
offspring.
No dog shall be deemed vicious if it is a professionally trained dog for law
enforcement or guard duties. Vicious dogs shall not be classified in a manner
that is specific as to breed.
If the burden of proof has been met, the court shall deem the dog or other
animal to be a vicious animal.
If a dog or other animal is found to be a vicious animal, the animal shall be
spayed or neutered within ten (10) days of the finding at the expense of the
owner and microchipped, if not already, and is subject to enclosure. A dog or
other animal found to be a vicious animal shall not be released to the owner
until the administrator or an animal control warden approves the enclosure. No
owner or keeper of a vicious animal shall sell or give away the vicious animal
without court approval. Whenever an owner of a vicious animal relocates, he or
she shall notify the administrator. The only times that a vicious animal is
allowed out of the enclosure are: a) if it is necessary for the owner or keeper
to obtain veterinary care for the dog, b) in case of an emergency or natural
disaster where the animal's life is threatened, or c) to comply with the order
of the court, provided the animal is securely muzzled and restrained with a
leash not exceeding six feet (6') in length, and shall be under the direct
control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the animal or muzzled in its
owner's residence.
Any dog or other animal that has been found to be a vicious animal and is not
confined to an enclosure shall be impounded by the administrator, an animal
control warden, or the law enforcement authority having jurisdiction in that
area.
If the owner of the vicious animal has not appealed the impoundment order to
the circuit court within fifteen (15) working days, the animal may be
euthanized.
Upon filing a notice of appeal, the order of euthanasia shall be automatically
stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. The owner shall bear all costs
associated with the impoundment and the burden of timely notification to the
administrator in writing.
Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the physically
handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police owned dogs are exempt from this
section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies and registered with
the department for its specific duties. It shall be the duty of the owner of
such exempted dog to notify the administrator of changes of address. In the
case of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the administrator advised
of the location where such dog will be stationed. The administrator shall
provide police and fire departments with a categorized list of such exempted
dogs, and shall promptly notify such departments of any address changes
reported to him.
In order for a dog or other animal to be deemed "dangerous", the administrator,
deputy administrator, animal control warden, or other law enforcement officer
must perform a thorough investigation which must include sending, within three
(3) days of the administrator becoming aware of the alleged infraction,
notification to the owner of the animal alleged to have committed the
infraction, the fact of the initiation of an investigation, and affording the
owner an opportunity to meet with the administrator or his appointee prior to
the making of a determination. The administrator or his appointee shall gather
any medical or veterinary evidence; interview witnesses; and make a detailed
written report with his findings. No dog or other animal shall be deemed a
"dangerous animal" without clear and convincing evidence. The owner of the
dangerous animal shall be sent immediate notification of the determination by
registered or certified mail that shall include a complete description of the
appeal process. Testimony of a certified animal behaviorist may be relevant to
the administrator's determination of whether the dog's or other animal's
behavior was justified pursuant to the provisions of this section.
No dog or other animal shall be declared dangerous if the administrator or his
appointee determines the conduct of the dog or other animal was justified
because:
   A.   The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the time
was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog or
other animal, or upon the property of the owner or custodian of the dog or
other animal;
   B.   The injured, threatened, or killed person was tormenting, abusing,
assaulting, or physically threatened the dog or other animal or its offspring;
or
   C.   The dog or other animal was responding to pain or injury, or was
protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or
offspring.
   D.   The injured, threatened or killed companion animal was attacking or
threatening to attack the dog or other animal or its offspring.
If a dog or other animal is found to be a dangerous animal, the animal shall be
spayed or neutered within ten (10) days of the finding at the expense of the
owner and microchipped, if not already, and one or more of the following as
deemed appropriate by the administrator or his appointee:
   A.   Evaluation of the dog or other animal by a board certified veterinary
behaviorist or other recognized expert in the field and completion of training
or other treatment as deemed appropriate by the expert. The owner of the dog or
other animal shall be responsible for all costs associated with the evaluation
and training ordered under this section.
   B.   Direct supervision and leash control by an adult eighteen (18) years of
age or older when the animal is on public or private property other than the
property of the owner.
   C.   The dog or other animal shall be muzzled when the animal is on public
or private property other than the property of the owner in a manner that will
prevent it from biting any person or other animal.
Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the physically
handicapped, and sentry, guard, or police owned dogs are exempt from this
section; provided, an attack or injury to a person occurs while the dog is
performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies and registered with
the department for its specific duties. It shall be the duty of the owner of
such exempted dog to notify the administrator of changes of address. In the
case of a sentry or guard dog, the owner shall keep the administrator advised
of the location where such dog will be stationed. The administrator shall
provide police and fire departments with a categorized list of such exempted
dogs, and shall promptly notify such departments of any address changes
reported to him.
It is unlawful for any person to knowingly or recklessly permit any dangerous
dog or other animal to leave the premises of its owner when not under the
control by a leash or other recognized control methods.
The owner of a dog or other animal found to be a dangerous animal pursuant to
this section by the administrator or his appointee may file a complaint against
the administrator or his appointee in the circuit court within thirty (30) days
of receipt of the notification of the determination, for a de novo hearing on
the determination. The proceeding shall be conducted as a civil hearing
pursuant to the Illinois rules of evidence and the code of civil procedure,
including the discovery provisions. After hearing both parties' evidence, the
court may make a determination of a dangerous animal if the administrator meets
his burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence. Until the order has been
reviewed and at all times during the appeal process, the owner shall comply
with the requirements set forth by the administrator or his appointee. (Ord.

9-28: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   A stormwater management permit is required if:
      1.   The development is located in the regulatory floodplain;
      2.   There is a substantial improvement in the floodplain;
      3.   There is any floodplain within the site;
      4.   The development impacts a wetland; or
      5.   The development has a detention storage facility previously
permitted under this chapter and the net new impervious area is less than five
thousand (5,000) square feet and storage for those improvements is not included
in that detention storage facility.
      6.   The development disturbs more than five thousand (5,000) square feet
of ground or two hundred fifty (250) cubic yards of material (earth, soil,
clay, gravel, grindings, etc.), unless the development consists solely of:
         a.   The installation, renovation or replacement of a septic system,
potable water service line or other utility serving an existing structure
located outside of a special management area;
         b.   The installation of a watermain, sanitary sewer, overhead and
underground utilities located outside of special management areas;
         c.   The maintenance, repair or at grade replacement of existing lawn
areas not otherwise requiring a stormwater management permit under this
chapter; or
         d.   The maintenance of an existing stormwater management measure,
Major and Minor Stormwater Systems, not requiring other State or Federal
permits or approvals.
   B.   Certified communities may develop general permits for certain
activities with the approval of the Director.
   C.   All appropriate stormwater management related approvals and permits,
including, without limitation, an IDNR-OWR floodway/floodplain construction
permit, a USACE 404 permit, and an IDNR-OWR dam safety permit shall be obtained
from all Federal, State and regional authorities prior to the issuance of a
stormwater management permit. An IEPA NPDES ILR10 permit, if required, shall be
obtained prior to the start of construction.
   D.   All permit fees shall be paid at the time of application, or according
to a schedule determined by the Administrator. Permit fees shall be established
by separate ordinance. Fees may be established based upon all costs incurred by
the permitting authority in the administration of the permit, including,
without limitation, the costs of review and inspections both during and after
construction within the period for the establishment of permanent cover.
   E.   The design of stormwater facilities, calculations for the determination
of the regulatory floodplain and calculations of the impacts of development
shall meet the standards of this chapter and shall be prepared, signed, and
sealed by a professional engineer (excluding category I BMPs). The signature
and seal of such professional engineer shall stand as his or her opinion that
the submittals which accompany the permit application meet the requirements of
this chapter.
      1.   For projects which include earth embankments which are subjected to
a differential water pressure the submittal shall include evidence that the
embankment design and construction specifications are adequate for the design
conditions. This review shall include consideration of the existing foundation
soils for the embankment, the materials from which the embankment is to be
constructed, compaction requirements for the embankment and protection of the
embankment from failure due to overtopping. Specifications for the construction
and materials for all such embankments shall be included. When directed by the
Administrator, or when the impounded water pressure differential exceeds three
feet (3') or when appropriate considering the volume impounded and water
surface elevation differential to which the embankment is subjected, these
calculations may be required to be reviewed, signed and sealed by a qualified
geotechnical or registered structural engineer.
      2.   For structures (not including earth embankments) that are subject to
a differential water pressure greater than three feet (3') the submittal shall,
at a minimum, be reviewed by a professional engineer. Such reviews shall
include stability of the structure under design conditions considering the
protection of downstream life and property in the event of a failure. When
directed by the Administrator the calculations submitted for such structures
shall be reviewed, signed and sealed by a registered structural engineer. (Ord.

9-29: DURATION AND REVISION OF PERMITS:
   A.   Permits expire on December 31st of the third year following the date of
their issuance.
   B.   For new buildings or substantial improvements to a building in the
floodplain, the start of construction of the structure must begin within one
hundred eighty (180) days from the date of permit issuance. If start of
construction of the structure has not begun within one hundred eighty (180)
days of permit issuance, the applicant shall submit to the Administrator proof
that the BFE has not changed and that the project is in compliance with any
revisions to this chapter or resubmit a revised application that reflects
changes to the BFE or any revisions to this chapter. If the Administrator
determines that the revised plans are in compliance with the then current
requirements of this chapter, an amended permit may be issued.
   C.   If the permitted activity has begun but is not complete by the
expiration date of the permit, the permittee may submit a written request for
an extension to the Administrator. Upon receipt of such request, the
Administrator may extend the expiration date for up to three (3) years for
permitted activities outside special management areas. Expiration dates for
permitted activities within special management areas may also be extended for
up to three (3) years provided the activity is in compliance with the then
current requirements of this chapter. A permittee may apply for any number of
extensions.
   D.   If the applicant revises the approved plans after issuance of the
permit, the permittee shall submit the revised plans to the Administrator,
along with a written request for approval. If the Administrator determines that
the revised plans are in compliance with the then current requirements of this
chapter, an amended permit may be issued. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-
2019)
9-30: REQUIRED SUBMITTALS:
   A.   Refer to table
9-30 of this section for the submittals required to accompany the permit
application based upon the type of development. The Administrator may, at his
or her discretion, modify the submittal requirements on a case by case basis
considering the size, complexity and likelihood that a development will affect
the discharge of stormwater runoff. Such modifications shall be requested and
approved in writing. The Administrator's response shall note the relevant
findings and be specific as to what submittal requirements are changed. The
Administrator may not modify submittal requirements for any aspect of the
development requiring State or Federal permits or approvals, nor for any
application in which any variance is requested.

All developments and redevelopments shall meet the requirements of this
article. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-59: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL:
   A.   Erosion and sedimentation control planning shall be part of the initial
site planning process. In planning the development of the site, the applicant
shall consider the sensitivity of existing soils to erosion and topographical
features such as steep slopes, stream corridors and special management areas
which must be protected to reduce the amount of erosion and sedimentation which
occurs. Where appropriate, existing vegetation shall be protected from
disturbance during construction by fencing or other means. In the planning
process the applicant shall also address the following:
      1.   For projects that involve phased construction, existing land cover
for those areas not under current development shall be addressed. If existing
land cover does not consist of an appropriate dense vegetation, then these
phases shall be planted temporarily to reduce erosion from idle land.
      2.   In planning the erosion and sedimentation control strategy,
preference shall be given to reducing erosion rather than controlling
sedimentation. In order to accomplish this, the construction sequence of the
phases must be carefully considered so that the amount of land area exposed to
erosive forces is the minimum consistent with completing construction.
   B.   An applicant with land disturbing activities greater than one acre
shall provide, upon receipt, a copy of the Notice of Intent, stormwater general
permit under Illinois Environmental Protection Agency general NPDES permit no.
ILR 10 (IEPA NPDES ILR10).
   C.   Standards and specifications for erosion and sedimentation control
practices shall be taken from the current editions of one of the following
sources, where the "Illinois Urban Manual" conflicts with the other sources,
the Illinois Urban Manual shall prevail:
      1.   The "Illinois Urban Manual";
      2.   The Technical Manual;
      3.   IDOT Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Projects; and
      4.   Other design criteria, standards or specifications may be approved
by the Administrator.
   D.   The runoff from disturbed areas shall not leave the site without first
passing through sedimentation control practices or devices. This requirement
shall apply to all phases of construction and shall include an ongoing process
of implementation of practices and maintenance of those practices during both
the construction season and any construction shutdown periods.
   E.   In the hydraulic and hydrologic design of major erosion and
sedimentation control practices (those whose tributary drainage area is greater
than 3 acres) such as sedimentation basins and traps, diversions and the like,
the design frequency shall be commensurate with the risk of the design event
being exceeded. The following design frequencies shall be regarded as minimum
design frequencies for the construction period:
      1.   If disturbance is estimated to be permanently stabilized in less
than six (6) months, the storm event having a fifty percent (50%) (2-year
event) chance of being exceeded in any year shall be used for design purposes;
      2.   If disturbance is estimated to be permanently stabilized in greater
than six (6) months but less than one year, the design frequency for major
sedimentation basins shall be a rainfall event with a twenty percent (20%) (5-
year event) chance of being exceeded in any one year;
      3.   If disturbance is estimated to be permanently stabilized in greater
than one year, major sedimentation basins shall be designed for a rainfall
event with a ten percent (10%) (10-year event) chance of being exceeded in any
one year; and
      4.   All sedimentation basins shall be designed for a minimum residence
time of ten (10) hours for detained runoff and draw down the storage within a
twenty four (24) to forty (40) hour period at discharge rates, which at a
minimum do not increase over pre-construction conditions for the storm event
having a fifty percent (50%) chance (2-year frequency, 24-hour storm event) of
being exceeded in any given year. The basin should have a maintenance schedule
that restores its original design dimensions once the sediment has accumulated
to two-thirds (2/3) the design depth of the dead sediment storage per the
Illinois Urban Manual.
   F.   The erosion and sedimentation control plan shall designate a series of
practices which shall be implemented either at the direction of the applicant
or the applicant's representative on- site or at the direction of the
Administrator should an inspection of the site indicate a deficiency in soil
and erosion and sedimentation control practices. At a minimum, these practices
shall include: sedimentation basins, sediment traps, diversion swales, silt
fences, temporary seeding, and erosion control blankets.
   G.   The area of disturbance on-site at any one time shall be limited to
forty (40) acres. An additional forty (40) acres (a maximum of 80 acres of
disturbance at any one time) may be disturbed if necessary to balance cut and
fill on-site. The Administrator may approve a larger area of disturbance
pursuant to a plan for phased construction or after development has begun, if
the developer adequately demonstrates the need therefor and the Administrator
finds that adequate temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation control
practices can be maintained and that the developer is proposing an area of
disturbance which at any one time is the smallest practical area consistent
with the intent to limit disturbed area and minimize the risk of sediment being
introduced into site runoff and being carried off-site. No additional area may
be disturbed without the permission of the Administrator until the previously
disturbed areas have been temporarily or permanently stabilized.
   H.   Stabilization of disturbed areas must, at a minimum, be initiated
immediately whenever any clearing, grading, excavating or other earth
disturbing activities have permanently ceased on any portion of the site, or
temporarily ceased on any portion of the site and will not resume for a period
exceeding fourteen (14) calendar days. Stabilization of disturbed areas must be
initiated within one working day of permanent or temporary cessation of earth
disturbing activities and shall be completed as soon as possible but not later
than fourteen (14) days from the initiation of stabilization work in an area.
Exceptions to these time frames are specified below:
      1.   Where the initiation of stabilization practices is precluded by snow
cover, stabilization practices shall be initiated as soon as practicable.
      2.   On areas where construction activity has temporarily ceased and will
resume after fourteen (14) days, a temporary stabilization method can be used.
   I.   The condition of the construction site for winter shutdown shall be
addressed early in the fall growing season so that slopes and other bare earth
areas may be stabilized with temporary and/or permanent vegetative cover for
proper erosion and sedimentation control. All open areas that are to remain
idle throughout the winter shall receive temporary erosion control practices
including temporary seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanket prior to
the end of the fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of
the growing season must incorporate soil stabilization practices that do not
rely on vegetative cover such as erosion control blanket and heavy mulching.
   J.   Erosion and sedimentation control plans shall include the following:
      1.   Detailed construction phasing plan identifying erosion and
sedimentation control practices to be in place for each phase shall be
submitted;
      2.   Erosion and sedimentation control practices to be installed
initially prior to stripping existing vegetation or mass grading shall be
indicated on the plans;
      3.   Permanent stabilization practices shall be indicated on a separate
plan;
      4.   The expected 2-year and 10-year runoff rates from all off-site areas
draining into the site shall be identified on the plan;
      5.   Methods for conveying flows through the site during construction
shall be indicated. These methods must include the temporary and permanent
stabilization practices to be used to reduce velocity and erosion from flow
through the construction zone;
      6.   A maintenance schedule of each practice used shall be indicated on
the plan;
      7.   A note stating that at a minimum, all erosion and sedimentation
control practices on-site shall be inspected in accordance with the current
IEPA NPDES ILR10 permit, which is weekly or after a one-half inch (1/2") or
greater rainfall event, as of the revision date of this chapter. Any required
repairs shall be made to keep these practices functional as designed; and
      8.   Special management areas shall be indicated on the erosion and
sedimentation control plan.
   K.   Temporary stream crossings of linear watercourses used only for and
during construction shall be designed to convey a storm event having a fifty
percent (50%) chance of occurrence in any given year (2-year frequency, 24-hour
storm event), without overtopping unless a more frequent design event is
allowed by the Administrator and will not obstruct the portion of the channel
carrying the base flow. The entire crossing shall be designed to withstand
hydrodynamic and erosive forces up to the base flood event without washing out.
Ephemeral streams may be crossed at temporary at grade crossings provided that
the crossing point is stabilized with materials resistant to the erosive forces
produced by runoff from the upstream drainage area and the design is approved
by the Administrator. All temporary stream crossings shall be completely
removed, and the stream restored to its preconstruction condition upon
completion of construction. Restoration shall incorporate appropriate native
vegetation.
   L.   To the extent practicable, proposed ditches and waterways that are to
convey off-site flows through the site shall be stabilized prior to their use
to convey flood flows.
   M.   Erosion control blanket placed along the banks of linear watercourses,
within wetlands or buffers shall be one hundred percent (100%) biodegradable or
photodegradable, unless otherwise approved by the Director (or Administrator in
a community certified to administer article VII of this chapter).
   N.   Stockpiles of soil and other building materials (sand, limestone, etc.)
shall not be located in special management areas or buffers, unless otherwise
approved by the Administrator. If a stockpile is to remain in place for more
than three (3) days, erosion and sedimentation control practices shall be
provided.
   O.   Storm sewer inlets shall be protected with sediment trapping and/or
filter control devices during construction.
   P.   Water pumped or which is otherwise discharged from the site during
construction dewatering shall be filtered and a means provided to reduce
erosion and sedimentation.
   Q.   Graveled roads, access drives, parking areas of sufficient width and
length and vehicle wash down facilities if necessary, shall be provided to
prevent soil from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any soil
tracked onto a public or private roadway shall be removed before the end of
each workday or sooner as directed by the authority maintaining the roadway or
the Administrator.
   R.   On areas of exposed soils, the generation of dust shall be minimized
through the appropriate application of water or other dust suppression
techniques.
   S.   The applicant shall design, install, implement, and maintain effective
pollution prevention practices to minimize the discharge of pollutants. At a
minimum, such practices must be designed, installed, implemented and maintained
to:
      1.   Ensure and demonstrate compliance with applicable State and/or local
waste disposal, sanitary sewer or septic system regulations;
      2.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from equipment and vehicle
washing, wheel wash water, and other wash waters. Wash waters must be treated
in a sediment basin or alternative control that provides equivalent or better
treatment prior to discharge;
      3.   Minimize the exposure of building materials, building products,
construction wastes, trash, landscape materials, fertilizers, pesticides,
herbicides, detergents, sanitary waste and other materials present on the site
to precipitation and to stormwater;
      4.   Minimize the exposure of fuel, oil, hydraulic fluid and other
petroleum products by storing them in covered areas or containment areas;
      5.   Minimize the discharge of pollutants from spills and leaks and
implement chemical spill and leak prevention and response procedures; and
      6.   Monitor directional drilling operations and have a contingency plan
in place to contain drilling lubricants and restore disturbed areas if a frac-
out occurs.
   T.   For sites that require an IEPA NPDES ILR10 permit, the applicant shall
provide qualified personnel to inspect disturbed areas of the site for
compliance with the plan. Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the
current IEPA NPDES ILR10 permit, which, as of the revision date of this
chapter, is at least once every seven (7) calendar days and within twenty four
(24) hours of the end of a storm or by the end of the following business or
work day that is one-half inch (1/2") or greater. Areas inaccessible during
inspections due to flooding or other unsafe conditions shall be inspected
within seventy two (72) hours of becoming accessible. Inspections may be
reduced to once per month when construction activities have ceased due to
frozen conditions. Weekly inspections will recommence when construction
activities are conducted, or if there is one-half inch (1/2") or greater
precipitation event, or a discharge due to snowmelt occurs. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-

Notes:
   1.    A watershed benefit measure may be provided in lieu of the required
detention storage facility and stormwater mitigation/BMP at the discretion of
the Administrator.
   2.    Required at the discretion of the Administrator where known flooding
or drainage issues are in the immediate vicinity of the project, in areas
without adequate downstream stormwater capacity, or that outlet to a volume
sensitive watershed.
   3.    Fee-in-lieu requires approval of the Administrator and compliance with
the requirements listed under subsection B4 of this section.
   4.    Redevelopment with a net new impervious area less than the impervious
area being removed will not be required to provide a detention storage facility
per subsection B3a of this section.
      1.   The Administrator may require stormwater management measures for
developments or redevelopments in areas where known flooding or drainage issues
are in the immediate vicinity of the project, in areas without adequate
downstream stormwater capacity, or that outlet to a volume sensitive watershed
unless the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator,
that the development or redevelopment will not result in adverse impacts
upstream or downstream of the site.
      2.   An exemption from the detention storage facility requirements may be
granted by the Administrator in accordance with subsection
9-84R, tables
9-84.A and
9-84.B of this article for redevelopment sites containing an existing detention
storage facility. The redevelopment may still be required to provide a BMP or
watershed benefit measure to meet the requirements of table
9-81 of this subsection B.
      3.   The following special conditions and cases of development and
redevelopment are exempt from providing stormwater management measures:
         a.   Redevelopment with a net new impervious area less than the
impervious area being removed will not be required to provide a detention
storage facility. The redevelopment may still be required to provide a BMP to
meet any other requirements of table
9-81 of this subsection B, such as hydrologically disturbed area or total
impervious area;
         b.   Bridge and culvert modifications, repairs, and replacements;
         c.   Projects whose sole purpose is to install, repair or replace
water, sewer and all underground or overhead utility lines within a public
right-of-way or utility easement;
         d.   Stream restoration projects;
         e.   Restoration of natural areas;
         f.   Wetland mitigation facilities or banks; and
         g.   Flood-relief projects.
      4.   The Administrator may waive the requirements of table
9-81 of this subsection B and approve a fee-in-lieu of stormwater management
measures if the following conditions are met:
         a.   The development will not increase peak discharges from the site,
nor change the existing conveyance of off-site flow:
            (1)   If the development produces increased runoff to a volume
sensitive watershed, fee-in-lieu may be allowed if it discharges to an outfall
in accordance with subsection
9-83B1 of this article;
            (2)   If the development produces increased runoff to a volume
sensitive watershed and it does not discharge to an outfall in accordance with
subsection
9-83B1 of this article, then:
               (A)   The applicant shall be required to rebuild the outfall in
accordance with subsection 9-83B1 of this article before approval of fee-in-
lieu; or
               (B)   The cost to rebuild the outfall in accordance with
subsection
9-83B1 of this article shall be included in the assessed fee.
         b.   The development provides a net benefit in water quality compared
to the existing conditions;
         c.   The Administrator may waive the requirements of subsection
9-81B3a of this article if the development discharges directly to a perennial
stream or river and will not cause an adverse hydraulic impact. (Ord. 19-151,
5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-82: GENERAL STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   No development shall:
      1.   Result in any new or additional expense to any person other than the
developer for flood protection; or
      2.   Increase water surface elevations or decrease conveyance capacity
upstream or downstream of the site.
   B.   Analysis and design of all stormwater management measures required for
a development shall:
      1.   Comply with the standards and criteria established in any applicable
Watershed Plan or Interim Watershed Plan; and
      2.   Ensure that the site is reasonably safe from flooding.
Stormwater management measures shall be functional where practicable before a
building permit is issued for any other construction on a site and all of its
parcels.
   C.   The design of any development shall incorporate the following specific
planning principles:
      1.   Impervious areas are the minimum necessary to satisfy the intended
design function. Where requirements of zoning ordinances conflict with this
principle, consideration has been given to asking for a zoning variance.
      2.   Where feasible, allow sufficient right-of-way and easement widths so
that stormwater runoff may be conveyed in vegetated swales. Storm sewers may be
used for conveyance of nuisance flows and where conveyance in vegetated swales
is impractical.
      3.   Existing open channels have been preserved and incorporated into the
design.
      4.   BMPs have been used in the site drainage plan to reduce the volume
of stormwater runoff and the quantity of runoff pollutants.
      5.   Wetlands have been avoided, preserved or enhanced. (Ord. 19-151, 5-
7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-83: SITE RUNOFF REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The location of the existing outfall from the site prior to development
is maintained (unless approved in writing by the Administrator) and in a manner
so as not to cause an adverse hydraulic impact downstream. Concentrated
discharges from new developments must enter conveyance systems capable of
carrying the design flow rate without increasing flood elevations, damage,
inundation depths or duration, erosion or maintenance costs to upstream,
downstream, or adjacent properties.
   B.   The following principles and requirements shall be observed in the
design:
      1.   Off-Site Outfall: Surface drainage, Major and Minor Stormwater
Systems and Subsurface Drainage Systems shall be evaluated with regard to their
capacity and capability to convey nuisance flows and the detention storage
facility release without damage to downstream structures and land. The off-site
outfall shall be evaluated to the nearest open channel. If the outfall is
located within a publicly owned storm drainage system, it shall be evaluated to
the downstream location directed by the Administrator. The following provisions
shall apply:
         a.   The applicant or developer shall notify adjoining, downstream
property owners in writing of any proposed modifications to stormwater outlet
locations and designs.
         b.   Discharges from outfalls to downstream agricultural surface
drainage systems and steep slope zones (examples are provided in the Technical
Manual) with no base flow must be conveyed one hundred percent (100%)
underground within forty eight (48) hours after a storm event up to and
including the one percent (1%) chance storm event.
         c.   Off-site outfalls shall be located within a public right-of- way
or dedicated easement and marked on the record drawings. The easement language
shall clearly define the individual or entity responsible for long term
maintenance.
         d.   Discharge from outfalls to volume sensitive watersheds shall not
increase flood elevations and shall mitigate for any additional volume produced
to ensure the flood duration is not increased.
         e.   Off-site Agricultural Subsurface Drainage Systems shall not be
used for surface water discharges including the discharge from the control
structure or nuisance flows discharges, but may be used for stormwater
mitigation/BMP underdrains in accordance with reasonable use:
            (1)   The capacity of such systems shall be the lesser of the
existing downstream capacity or three thousandths of a cubic foot per second
per acre of tributary area (0.003 cfs/acre) to the Agricultural Subsurface
Drainage System;
            (2)   Nonagricultural Subsurface Drainage Systems may be used for
nuisance flows with the approval of the permitting authority or owner of the
Subsurface Drainage System;
            (3)   Nuisance flows must be conveyed in a storm sewer to an open
channel or publicly owned storm drainage system with approval by the permitting
authority if a Nonagricultural Subsurface Drainage System is not available; and
            (4)   Off-site Agricultural Subsurface Drainage Systems may be used
for surface water discharges including the discharge from the control structure
or nuisance flows discharges if there is an agreement between the applicant and
the downstream owner specific to capacity and long term maintenance and that
agreement is recorded with the property and on a plat.
         f.   If an off-site outfall is required to be constructed and the
downstream property owner refuses to grant access across his or her property,
and construction within a right-of-way or alternate route is not feasible or
reasonable, the applicant shall provide the Administrator a two (2) year post-
development security for the engineer's estimate of probable construction cost
for the off-site outfall plus a ten percent (10%) contingency. If the
downstream property owner has not granted access for construction of the
improvements within two (2) years following completion of the development, the
Administrator shall release the security.
         g.   The applicant shall consider coordinating with adjacent property
owners that may develop within the same tributary area to design and construct
a mutually beneficial stormwater management improvement to meet the
requirements of this chapter. Maintenance, construction costs, and
responsibilities for the improvement shall be coordinated between the owners by
an agreement.
         h.   Contributions to a Recapture Fund shall be considered by the
certified community for developments occurring without an off- site outfall
that meets the provisions of this section in an effort to establish the means
to construct a mutually beneficial stormwater system.
         i.   Permit applications are required to be submitted for a fifteen
(15) business day review to the following entities prior to issuance of a
stormwater management permit:
            (1)   Drainage Districts, if the development discharges to a
drainage facility owned and maintained by an active Drainage District within
the County; or
            (2)   Downstream municipalities (including unincorporated Kane
County), if the development discharges outside of the municipal boundary of the
certified community issuing the permit.
      2.   On-Site Drainage Systems: Agricultural Subsurface Drainage Systems
and other Subsurface Drainage Systems shall be evaluated in accordance with
article II of this chapter and the following provisions:
         a.   A subsurface drainage survey shall be conducted to locate
existing farm and storm drain tiles by means of slit trenching or other
appropriate methods performed by a qualified subsurface drainage consultant.
Any Subsurface Drainage System damaged during investigation shall be repaired
to its previous working status. A subsurface drainage survey shall include the
following as applicable on a topographic map:
            (1)   The location of each slit trench identified to correspond
with the investigation report and field staked at no less than fifty foot (50')
intervals;
            (2)   The location of each drain tile with a flow direction arrow,
tile size and any connection to adjoining properties;
            (3)   A summary of the investigation report showing trench
identification number, tile size, material and quality, percentage of tile
filled with water, percentage of restrictions caused by sedimentation, depth of
ground cover and working status; and
            (4)   The name, address, phone number and qualifications of the
person or consultant responsible for the subsurface drainage survey.
         b.   Information collected during the subsurface drainage survey shall
be used as part of the design and construction of a stormwater management
system that meets the requirements of this chapter. The County's standard
Subsurface Drainage System notes (refer to the Technical Guidance Manual) shall
be included on the plans. Subsurface Drainage Systems that service a single
site may be excused from this requirement upon approval from the Administrator.
         c.   The Administrator may accept a drain tile map prepared by a
Drainage District or other reliable source in lieu of a subsurface drainage
survey. The survey requirement shall be waived by the Administrator for any
development with less than five thousand (5,000) square feet of net new
impervious area. The Administrator may waive the survey requirement for other
development, provided the applicant submits a narrative and supporting evidence
indicating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that Subsurface Drainage
Systems are not likely present within the development. This evidence may
consist of:
            (1)   Soil maps;
            (2)   Historic aerial photographs;
            (3)   Historic topographic maps; and
            (4)   Wetland maps.
         d.   Subsurface Drainage Systems found on-site during design or
construction of the development shall be replaced and incorporated into the new
Minor Stormwater System or Subsurface Drainage System. The system or bypass
shall be of an equivalent size and capacity. The capacity shall be determined
by either the capacity of the existing tile flowing full, in its original
condition, or the existing downstream capacity, whichever is more restrictive.
A flow restrictor shall be required as necessary to achieve the existing
discharge requirements.
         e.   All existing on-site Agricultural Subsurface Drainage Systems not
serving a beneficial use shall be abandoned in their entirety by trench removal
prior to development and recorded on record drawings. If any existing system
continues to serve adjacent properties, the applicant or his or her
representative must maintain drainage service during construction until new
storm sewers or a maintainable outlet can be installed for a permanent
connection.
      3.   Off-Site Tributary: Existing drainage systems shall be evaluated
with regard to existing capabilities and reasonable future expansion capacities
of upstream properties. The following provisions shall apply:
         a.   All existing tributary Subsurface Drainage Systems shall be
incorporated into the new Minor Stormwater System or Subsurface Drainage System
including observation structures located at the limits of the site. Maintenance
access shall be provided through an easement;
         b.   Subsurface connections serving off-site tributary areas shall
have a free flow discharge into the drainage system within the development,
where practical, and shall not be subject to head pressure within the storm
sewer or surcharge resulting from fluctuating water elevations in a detention
storage facility;
         c.   Sizing of subsurface connections for off-site tributary areas
shall be based upon the established sizing chart published as part of Illinois
Drainage Law to allow for reasonable future subsurface drainage improvements to
occur on upstream, tributary farms. A drainage coefficient of three-eighth
inches per day (3/8"/day) shall be assumed for plastic tubing;
         d.   The applicant or his or her representative shall consult with the
upstream land owner regarding plans for future stormwater improvements. The
applicant or the representative shall provide documentation showing
consultation with the upstream owner regarding future drainage improvements;
and
         e.   Tributary surface conveyance from agricultural land shall be
accepted by the new development with design consideration given to the natural
amount of erosion, sediment and farm debris present in agricultural runoff.
Highly erodible land in agricultural production shall maintain agricultural
Best Management Practices in accordance with NRCS conservation guidelines and
standards. The following provisions shall apply:
            (1)   The applicant shall work with the agricultural land owners to
develop a means for a maintainable system, such as a sedimentation trap. The
proposed system may be provided on the site or the upstream agricultural
property;
            (2)   If a maintainable system is not provided then the tributary
surface conveyance from agricultural land shall bypass the Major and Minor
Stormwater System and detention storage facility within the development;
            (3)   Upstream surface agricultural flows shall be conveyed through
the development within a public right-of-way, outlot, or other commonly owned
property. It shall not be conveyed in a drainage easement located on a private,
residential property; and
            (4)   Maintenance costs and responsibility for this system shall be
included in the long-term maintenance plan in accordance with article IX of
this chapter for the development.
      4.   Preservation Of Existing Systems: New roadway construction shall
preserve existing Subsurface Drainage Systems within the right-of-way.
Observation structures shall be placed at the right-of-way and Subsurface
Drainage Systems found not to be flowing between structures at the end of
construction shall be replaced if damaged.
   C.   Minor Stormwater Systems shall be sized to convey runoff from the
tributary watershed under fully developed conditions consistent with the design
requirements of the permitting authority.
   D.   Major Stormwater Systems shall be sized to carry the storm with a one
percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year without causing additional
flood damage.
   E.   Major and Minor Stormwater Systems shall be located within easements or
rights-of-way explicitly providing for public access or maintenance of such
facilities.
   F.   All developments shall have an overland flow path to the downstream
limit of the site that will pass flow from the storm with a one percent (1%)
chance of occurrence in any one year without increasing flood damage. If the
upstream drainage area is less than twenty (20) acres, a storm sewer pipe and
inlet sized for the storm with a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any
one year may be constructed in lieu of providing an overland flow path.
Overland flow paths internal to the site shall be considered part of the Major
Stormwater System and shall be designed for conveyance of a minimum of one
cubic foot per second per tributary acre (1 cfs/acre) without damage to
structures. All structures adjacent to an overland flow path shall comply with
the building protection standards of section
9-139 of this chapter.
   G.   Design runoff rates shall be calculated using the event hydrograph
methods and the assumptions contained in subsection
9-84C of this article. Design runoff rates for minor conveyance systems may be
calculated using the rational method if the tributary watershed is less than
twenty (20) acres.
   H.   Any design runoff rate calculation method shall use Bulletin 70
northeast sectional rainfall statistics and shall calculate flow from all
tributary areas upstream of the point of design. Peak discharges for conveyance
design purposes shall be based on the one percent (1%) critical duration
considering the appropriate rainfall distribution.
   I.   Maximum flow depths for new transverse stream crossings shall not
exceed one foot (1') at the crown of the road during the storm with a one
percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year. The maximum flow depth on a
roadway shall not exceed six inches (6") at the crown for flow parallel to the
roadway. For flow over a roadway or parallel to a roadway the product of the
flow depth (in feet) and velocity (in feet per second) shall not exceed four
(4) for the storm with a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year.
   J.   Transfers of waters between watersheds (diversions) shall be prohibited
except when such transfers will not violate the provisions of subsection
9-82A of this article and are otherwise lawful. Watersheds for the purposes of
this section shall be the major watershed divides shown in article XVII,
appendix A of this chapter.
   K.   Building protection standards shall be in accordance with section
9-139 of this chapter. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-84: DETENTION STORAGE FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   The onsite hydrologically disturbed area, area of land cover
disturbance, or a combination thereof, whichever encompasses the greatest area
of the site, shall be used to calculate the required detention storage volume.
The tributary area at the point of discharge shall be used to calculate the
allowable release rate of the restrictor for the detention storage facility.
   B.   Absent any applicable Watershed Plan or Interim Watershed Plan,
sufficient detention storage shall be provided such that the probability of the
post-development release rate exceeding 0.1 cubic foot per second per acre of
development shall be less than one percent (1%) per year.
      1.   For sites where the undeveloped release rate is less than 0.1 cubic
feet per second per acre, the developed release rate and corresponding
detention storage volume shall be based on the existing undeveloped release
rate for the site.
      2.   The applicant shall demonstrate the allowable release rate from the
site, considering all upstream tributary flows, is less than the existing
conditions flows from the one percent (1%) critical duration design storm.
      3.   The Administrator may allow a higher release rate to accommodate the
minimum restrictor size specified in subsection I of this section provided that
the applicant demonstrates there are no adverse impacts.
   C.   Runoff volumes shall be calculated using event hydrograph methods (such
as EPA-SWMM, HEC-1, HEC-HMS, TR-20, TR-55 or other tabular methods using SCS
curve number methodology as approved by the Administrator). Event methods shall
incorporate the following assumptions:
      1.   Antecedent moisture condition equals two (2);
      2.   Appropriate Huff rainfall distribution except that SCS type II
distribution is acceptable with TR-55 tabular method only; and
      3.   Twenty four (24) hour duration for the storm with a one percent (1%)
probability of occurrence in any one year as specified by Bulletin 70 northeast
sectional rainfall statistics.
   D.   When depressional storage is present on-site, detention storage volume
shall be provided in accordance with subsections A and B of this section. A
volume equivalent to any filled depressional storage shall be provided between
the high-water elevation and the elevation of the emergency overflow at a one-
to-one (1:1) ratio. The emergency overflow shall be designed and sized in
accordance with subsection G of this section.
   E.   If there is additional on-site or off-site tributary area to the
detention storage facility that is routed to the basin, but is not
hydrologically disturbed or is off-site to the development, then:
      1.   Detention volume shall be provided for the development according to
subsections A and B of this section when there is no depressional storage on-
site. The restrictor shall be sized independently for a release rate of 0.1
cubic feet per second per acre for the total tributary area to the detention
storage facility using the computed high-water elevation and assuming
appropriate tailwater considerations. The normal water level shall be designed
to establish the design head on the reservoir side of the restrictor. The
emergency overflow shall be sized to accommodate the upstream tributary flow in
accordance with subsection G of this section. Two stage restrictors shall be
considered with large, off-site tributary areas.
      2.   Sites with upstream tributary flows and depressional storage shall
provide detention volume for the development in accordance with subsection B of
this section and shall replace any lost depressional storage between the high-
water elevation and the elevation of the emergency overflow. The restrictor
shall be sized independently using the high-water elevation used to replace the
depressional storage, and the normal water elevation. The restrictor is sized
for a maximum release rate at the new high-water elevation for 0.1 cubic feet
per second per acre for the total tributary area. An emergency overflow shall
be sized to accommodate the upstream tributary flow in accordance with
subsections D and G of this section.
   F.   Nuisance flows shall be included when calculating the allowable release
rate. Any nuisance flows that are not routed through the detention storage
facility shall be added to the allowable release rate assuming a rate of five
(5) gallons per minute per structure with sump pumps for the first fifty (50)
structures, and assuming three (3) gallons per minute per structure for every
structure thereafter.
   G.   The detention storage facility shall have an emergency overflow set at
a minimum elevation required to contain the detention storage volume and any
depressional storage volume in accordance with subsection D of this section.
The emergency overflow shall be sized to convey the flow from the allowable
release rate for the site for the one percent (1%) critical duration design
storm.
   H.   Hydraulic computations for the release structure must assume
appropriate backwater conditions considering the likelihood of concurrent flood
events on the site and receiving stream.
   I.   Restrictors such as orifices, weirs and perforated risers shall be
located within a control structure and be designed to prevent tampering and
clogging and reduce the need for maintenance. The Administrator may adopt a
minimum restrictor policy so long as the policy does not have a minimum
diameter greater than four inches (4") when a single pipe outlet or an orifice
plate is used to restrict the outflow from a detention storage facility. The
Administrator may require a restrictor less than four inches (4") in diameter
if it is determined there will be adverse impacts to properties downstream or
if it outlets to a volume sensitive watershed.
   J.   Detention storage facilities shall be designed such that:
      1.   A minimum freeboard of one foot (1') is provided above the high-
water elevation as determined by the flow over the emergency overflow according
to subsection G of this section.
      2.   All design detention storage volume shall be provided above the
seasonal high groundwater table and the invert elevation of the restrictor;
      3.   The impacts of stormwater runoff on water quality are minimized by
incorporating BMPs as described in article V of this chapter;
      4.   The distance between inlets and outlets is maximized to the extent
possible;
      5.   Sedimentation and catchment of floating material is facilitated.
Unless specifically approved by the Administrator, concrete lined low flow
ditches shall not be used in detention storage facilities;
      6.   The basin functions without human intervention under tailwater
conditions assuming the tailwater conditions for the receiving stream is equal
to the design storm event with a ten percent (10%) (10-year event) chance of
being exceeded in any one year; and
      7.   Minimum maintenance is required and there is adequate access for
maintenance equipment.
   K.   Detention storage facilities located within the regulatory floodplain
shall:
      1.   Comply with article VI of this chapter;
      2.   Store the required amount of detention volume to meet the allowable
release rate under all stream flow and tailwater conditions up to the design
storm event with a ten percent (10%) (10-year event) chance of being exceeded
in any one year flood elevation on the adjacent receiving watercourse. The
Administrator may approve designs which can be shown by detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis to provide a net watershed benefit not otherwise realized by
strict application of the requirements set forth in this subsection; and
      3.   Provide compensatory storage in accordance with section
9-141 of this chapter.
   L.   Detention volume provided by enlarging existing regulatory floodplain
storage (an on-stream detention storage facility) shall be allowed only as a
watershed benefit measure.
   M.   Detention storage facilities may be located off-site if:
      1.   The off-site storage facility meets all the requirements of this
article;
      2.   Adequate storage capacity in the off-site facility is dedicated to
the development; and
      3.   The development includes means to convey the one percent (1%) chance
design storm to the off-site storage facility.
   N.   Detention storage facilities for redevelopment shall be designed and
constructed according to subsection R, tables
9-84.A and
9-84.B of this section with the following characteristics:
      1.   The required total detention volume for the site shall not be less
than the existing volume of the existing detention storage facility at the time
of application, regardless of the provisions of this section;
      2.   Incidental disturbance to an existing detention storage facility to
provide new required detention volume will not be counted as part of the
hydrologically disturbed area;
      3.   The redevelopment provides stormwater mitigation/BMPs in accordance
with section
9-137 of this chapter, subsection
9-81B,
table 9-81 of this article and article V of this chapter; and
      4.   The redevelopment provides adequate capacity to convey stormwater
runoff to the existing detention storage facility for all storms up to and
including the one percent (1%) design storm.
   O.   Structures built across the channel to impound water to meet detention
storage requirements shall be prohibited on any perennial stream (i.e., has
continuous flow) unless part of a public flood control project with a net
watershed benefit. Those streams appearing as blue on a USGS quadrangle map
shall be assumed to be perennial unless better data is provided by the
developer. In all cases it must be demonstrated that all such structures will
not cause short term or long-term stream instability. Where such facilities are
approved the applicant must also comply with article VI of this chapter and
obtain an IDNR-OWR dam safety permit or letter stating no permit is required
prior to the start of such activity.
   P.   All structures adjacent to a detention storage facility shall comply
with the building protection standards of section
9-139 of this chapter.
   Q.   Record drawings shall be provided for every detention storage facility
and shall indicate the as-constructed volume and utility information, including
the control structure.
   R.   Maintenance costs and responsibility for every detention storage
facility shall be included in the long-term maintenance plan submitted as part
of the stormwater management permit for the development.

   Notes:
      1.    Required at the discretion of the Administrator where known
flooding or drainage issues are in the immediate vicinity of the project, in
areas without adequate downstream stormwater capacity, or that outlet to a
volume sensitive watershed.
      2.    Fee-in-lieu requires approval of the Administrator and compliance
with the requirement listed under subsection
9-81B4 of this chapter.
   C.   Category I BMPs shall provide volume reduction and water quality
treatment of one-inch (1.0") of rainfall over the new impervious area. The
required volume reduction shall be calculated as the product of the new
impervious area and a one- inch (1.0") rainfall event with no abstractions.
   D.   Category II BMPs shall provide volume reduction and water quality
treatment of the required volume reduction. The required volume reduction shall
be:
      1.   Calculated as the product of the new impervious area and a one-inch
(1.0") rainfall event with no abstractions; or
      2.   Calculated via continuous simulation so that the post- development
infiltration volume shall match ninety percent (90%) of the pre-development
infiltration volume, based on the average annual rainfall.
   E.   The applicant shall identify the pollutants of concern that may be
generated by the development or redevelopment and select BMPs that address
those pollutants. BMPs shall provide both water quality treatment and runoff
volume reduction unless no pollutants are identified, then applicant may
provide a BMP that provides volume reduction only.
   F.   Pretreatment shall be required for runoff from non-permeable parking
lots or roadway areas that will enter an infiltration- based BMP.
      1.   The pretreatment shall be designed to treat one-inch (1.0") of
rainfall over the new impervious areas tributary to the infiltration-based BMP
to protect it from clogging prior to scheduled maintenance and to protect
groundwater quality;
      2.   Pretreatment options include: manufactured BMPs such as hydrodynamic
separators, biofiltration, vegetated swales, filter strips, or other
pretreatment BMPs, upon approval by the Administrator;
      3.   For manufactured BMPs, pollutant removal rates shall be eighty
percent (80%) removal of hydrocarbons and total suspended solids (TSS), with
the TSS being defined as the OK110 particle size distribution (PSD).
   G.   Infiltration-based BMPs are prohibited on sites where:
      1.   Fueling and vehicle maintenance areas are tributary to the BMP;
      2.   Commercial, industrial and institutional land uses are tributary to
the BMP within four hundred feet (400') of a known community water system well,
or within one hundred feet (100') of a known private well. The applicant shall
identify such zones from available information sources, which include the
Illinois State Water Survey, IEPA, USEPA, Kane County Health Department and the
local municipality or water agency;
      3.   Contaminants of concern, as identified by the USEPA or the IEPA
prior to development, are present in the soil through which infiltration would
occur. For sites with a No Further Remediation (NFR) letter from the USEPA or
IEPA, the applicant shall determine whether or not structural barriers are part
of the mitigation strategy and account for such measures in the design;
      4.   Soils on-site that are classified entirely as hydrologic soils group
A by the NRCS through which rapid infiltration would occur and alternate
locations on-site where more suitable soils are present are not practical;
      5.   Soils on-site through which infiltration would occur are proven to
have low permeability that are not conducive for infiltration-based BMPs and
alternate locations on-site where soil permeability is conducive for
infiltration-based BMPs are not practical; and
      6.   The seasonally high groundwater table is within two feet (2') of the
surface where infiltration would occur.
   H.   Developments and redevelopments that are prohibited from providing on-
site infiltration-based BMPs shall provide BMPs within a native vegetated

pretreatment practice identified within subsection F of this section; and
      2.   A payment of a fee in lieu of providing stormwater management
measures in accordance with section 9-85 of this chapter.
   I.   Developments and redevelopments that provide volume reduction are
eligible to receive credit for detention storage provided the calculated volume
is infiltrated and/or evapotranspirated in no less than one day or no greater
than five (5) days of the storm event. The potential average daily
evapotranspiration rate shall be one-tenth inch per day (0.1 in/day). The
applicant may provide site specific calculations to prove an evapotranspiration
rate that is different than one-tenth inch per day (0.1 in/day) for review and
approval by the Administrator. The applicant must document that:
      1.   The infiltration capacity of the subgrade soils of areas where BMPs
are proposed are suitable for the intended BMP. This shall be verified by an
appropriate geotechnical investigation. An opinion of the soils suitability
shall be provided by a professional engineer or soil scientist. Verification of
soil conditions prior to placement of subsurface storage material or topsoil
may be required by the Administrator. Final approval is at the sole discretion
of the Administrator; or
      2.   That Subsurface Drainage Systems and flow control orifices or weirs
are incorporated into the design of BMPs to meet this requirement.
   J.   Detention storage credit shall be:

four inches (24") in depth; and
      2.   The volume of the expected void space (typically no greater than 36
percent) within the uniformly graded stone, aggregate or sand layer of the BMP.
Particles less than one-sixteenth millimeter (1/16 mm) may not be used to
complete this calculation. The design shall incorporate pretreatment measures
to protect the void space from long term deposition of fine sediments. If
testing is completed on samples of the proposed material which indicates a
higher level of porosity, the applicant may submit the analysis completed on
the material along with the storage calculations.
   K.   The applicant may use the Technical Manual as a reference for the
design.
   L.   Native vegetated BMPs shall be planted with predominately native deep-
rooted vegetation and a BMP planting plan shall be submitted in accordance with

Nothing in this chapter purports to alter or affect the regulatory program
administered by IDNR-OWR. Anything in this chapter to the contrary
notwithstanding, if under the rules and regulations administered by IDNR-OWR a
submittal need not be made to IDNR-OWR, or a review, approval or permit from
IDNR-OWR need not be obtained, then nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to impose a requirement that such a submittal be made or that such a review,

Development that qualifies for any of the self-issuing Statewide or regional
permits administered by IDNR-OWR (Statewide permits nos. 1 through 14 and
regional permit no. 3) are similarly permitted under this article. The
developer need only submit to the Administrator such information as shall show
the Administrator that the development qualifies for the particular Statewide
or regional permit in question under the regulations established by IDNR-OWR
for such permit and no further submittal need be made under this article. All
other provisions of this chapter applicable to such development, however,
continue to apply. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-135: FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT:
All development shall meet the requirements set forth in this article. (Ord.
19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-136: FLOODPLAIN, REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN, BFE AND REGULATORY FLOODWAY LOCATIONS
AND STANDARDS:
   A.   The BFE shall be delineated on the site topography to establish the
regulatory floodplain area limits for regulation under this chapter. Regulatory
floodplains shall be delineated on the site map from the current FEMA FIRM, FIS
or LOMR and include those areas of the SFHA which are not regulatory
floodplains. The current version of the maps adopted and published by FEMA for
regulation under the NFIP together with any amendments, additions, revisions or
substitutions thereto or therefor adopted and published by FEMA at any time in
the future are hereby referred to, adopted, and made part hereof as if fully
set out in this chapter. A list of the current regulatory maps for the County
to be consulted is maintained by the department. A list of the current
regulatory maps for each community to be consulted is maintained by the
Administrator.
   B.   The BFE shall be the elevation of the profile shown for the design
storm with the one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any given year for the
site on the current Flood Insurance Study.
      1.   In the case of FEMA delineated AH Zones the elevation noted on the
current applicable regulatory map(s) shall be the BFE.
      2.   In the case of FEMA delineated AO Zones the BFE shall be the depth
number shown on the current applicable regulatory map(s) added to the highest
adjacent grade, or at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if
no depth number is provided.
      3.   When no BFE information exists and the upstream tributary area is
six hundred forty (640) acres or more, the BFE shall be determined using a
site-specific floodplain study by a professional engineer using appropriate
hydrologic and hydraulic models as follows:
         a.   Hydrologic models: TR-20, HEC-1, HEC-HMS;
         b.   Hydraulic models:HEC-2, HEC-RAS, WSP-2; or
         c.   A technique approved by the Administrator and IDNR-OWR.
      4.   Where a channel has a tributary drainage area of six hundred forty
(640) acres or more, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR-OWR for
approval.
      5.   For a nonriverine regulatory floodplain where no BFE information
exists, a site-specific floodplain study is required for the purpose of
establishing a BFE for the development.
      6.   For floodplains that are not regulatory, are not draining more than
six hundred forty (640) acres and for which no BFE has been determined, the
Administrator may require a site-specific floodplain study for the purpose of
establishing an FPE for the development.
      7.   The Administrator may require the use of a floodplain study not yet
approved by IDNR-OWR and FEMA if its use would establish a higher BFE than the
approved study. This provision may necessitate that different analyses be
prepared for other agencies having permitting jurisdiction over the floodplain
and floodway.
      8.   When none of the above apply but the proposed development consists
of more than fifty (50) lots or more than five (5) acres, a study acceptable to
the Administrator shall be provided for determination of a site-specific BFE.
   C.   The location of the regulatory floodway shall be as delineated on the
current applicable regulatory map(s). The location of the regulatory floodway
boundary shall be scaled on the site plan using references common to both the
map and the plan (typically the centerlines of adjacent roadways). Where an
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory
floodway boundary, IDNR-OWR should be contacted. If an area of the site is
located in the regulatory floodway that is higher than the BFE, that area is
subject to the floodway standards of sections
9-142 and
9-143 of this article, including the appropriate use criteria, until such time
as a LOMA or LOMR receives concurrence from IDNR-OWR and is issued by FEMA.
   D.   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations in the regulatory
floodway are as follows:
      1.   The flood profiles, flows and data from the current applicable
regulatory map must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study
data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, FEMA and IDNR-OWR shall
be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions
data to use. The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement obligates a public
entity to maintain the proposed conditions or the land cover is changing from
vegetative to nonvegetative. The Administrator shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
      2.   If the BFE at the site is affected by backwater from a downstream
receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed development shall be
shown to meet the requirements of this section with the receiving stream at
both the normal water elevation and BFE.
      3.   If the applicant is informed by IDNR-OWR, a local government or a
private owner that a downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is
scheduled to be removed, reconstructed or modified, or a public flood control
project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the
next five (5) years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and shown to
meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the
expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control
project is built, removed or modified.
      4.   If the development will result in a change in the location of the
regulatory floodway or an increase in the BFE, the applicant shall submit the
information required for the issuance of a CLOMR to IDNR-OWR and FEMA. A public
notice inviting comment on the proposed change in the BFE or location of the
regulatory floodway will be published by IDNR-OWR or its designee before a
CLOMR is issued. All communities adjacent to a watercourse alteration or
revocation shall be notified of the proposed development. Filling, grading,
dredging or excavating may take place upon issuance of a CLOMR issued by FEMA.
No further development activities shall take place in the existing or proposed
floodplain until a LOMR is issued by FEMA. The Administrator shall be copied on
all related correspondence.
      5.   In the circumstances listed below and located in a regulatory
floodway, at a minimum, the information set forth below shall be submitted to
IDNR-OWR for its review and approval:
         a.   Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge, culvert
crossing or roadway approach;
         b.   A professional engineer's determination that an existing bridge,
culvert crossing, or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the
analysis indicating the proposed flood profile;
         c.   A professional engineer's determination that a proposed bridge
affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a
smaller opening;
         d.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage;
         e.   Stormwater management permits issued to local units of government
for regulatory floodway and floodplain development;
         f.   BFE determinations where none now exist;
         g.   IDNR-OWR will issue permits for any IDNR-OWR projects, dams and
all other State, Federal or local unit of government projects, including
community projects;
         h.   IDNR-OWR will issue permits for construction and other activities
in public bodies of water pursuant to 17 Ill. Admin. Code 3708; and
         i.   Permits for organizations which are exempt from this chapter per
Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS) including State, Federal or local units of
government. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-137: GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
The following general performance standards are applicable to all development
in a regulatory floodplain. The standards of this section apply except when
superseded by more stringent requirements in subsequent sections.
   A.   No development shall be allowed in the regulatory floodplain that
singularly or cumulatively creates any increase in flood stage or velocity off-
site, or a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or
velocity on-site or a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.
   B.   For all projects involving a channel modification, fill, stream
maintenance or a levee, the floodway conveyance and storage capacity of the
regulatory floodplain shall not be reduced.
   C.   If the proposed development would result in a change in the regulatory
floodplain or BFE, the applicant shall obtain a CLOMR from FEMA. No buildings
may be built in the existing or proposed regulatory floodplain until the LOMR
is obtained from FEMA unless the building meets all the building protection
standards of section 9-139 of this article. Proposed changes to the regulatory
floodway delineation and the BFE must be submitted to IDNR-OWR for approval. If
a LOMR is a result of fill FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 shall be followed and
an engineering report shall be completed by a professional engineer or
certified soil scientist.
   D.   If the development is in the Fox River, a permit must also be received
from IDNR-OWR.
   E.   Prior to the commencement of any construction, modification or removal
of a dam the developer shall obtain an IDNR-OWR dam safety permit or letter
indicating a permit is not required.
   F.   For public flood control projects, sections
9-135 through 9-167 of this article will be deemed met if the applicant
demonstrates to IDNR-OWR and the committee that the proposed project:
      1.   By hydraulic and hydrologic modeling will not singularly or

   B.   Maintenance of existing buildings may occur unless the cumulative
percentage of damage, improvement, and maintenance is equal to or greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the structure's fair market value in the year prior to
each improvement, in which case it shall conform to section
9-139 of this article. Maintenance will be recorded cumulatively towards the
substantial improvement of the structure. The cost of maintenance improvements
shall be recorded cumulatively over a rolling, ten (10) year period, beginning
on January 1, 2010.
   C.   Substantial improvement does not include any work done to a structure
listed on the State or Federal Historic Register provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic
structure. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-141: COMPENSATORY STORAGE VOLUME STANDARDS:
The following standards apply within the regulatory floodplain:
   A.   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage volume will be required
for development or redevelopment in a riverine regulatory floodplain and at a
minimum, shall be equal to the regulatory floodplain flood storage volume
displaced multiplied by:
      1.   A factor of one and five-tenths (1.5) if no hydraulic modeling is
provided;
      2.   A factor of one and two-tenths (1.2) if hydraulic modeling is
provided;
      3.   A factor of one for public roadway, stream restoration or streambank
stabilization projects; or
      4.   A factor of one for depressional storage and nonriverine regulatory
floodplain.
   B.   Compensatory storage shall be provided incrementally such that:
      1.   The storage volume displaced below the existing ten percent (10%)
frequency flood elevation must be replaced below the proposed ten percent (10%)
frequency flood elevation.
      2.   The storage volume displaced above the existing ten percent (10%)
existing frequency flood elevation must be replaced above the proposed ten
percent (10%) frequency flood elevation and below the existing one percent (1%)
frequency flood elevation.
      3.   The additional compensatory storage required beyond a one to one (1:
1) ratio may be placed below the one percent (1%) frequency flood elevation.
      4.   Incremental compensatory storage for public roadway and stream
restoration or streambank stabilization projects may be waived, through a
written waiver at the discretion of the Administrator, provided the storage
volume displaced is replaced below the one percent (1%) frequency flood
elevation.
   C.   Compensatory storage volume for development or redevelopment in a
nonriverine regulatory floodplain area that is also adjacent to a lake shall be
equal to the storage volume displaced.
   D.   Compensatory storage volume requirements for development or
redevelopment in a nonriverine regulatory floodplain that is not adjacent to a
lake shall be replaced in accordance with subsection A4 of this section. If a
detention storage facility is required and the lost storage is in the same
tributary area then the lost storage shall be replaced in accordance with the
requirements for the loss of depressional storage in subsection 9-84D of this
chapter.
   E.   Compensatory storage areas shall be designed to drain freely and openly
to the channel and shall be located in a hydraulically equivalent area to the
development or redevelopment. This standard does not apply to nonriverine
regulatory floodplain or the replacement of depressional storage.
   F.   Compensatory storage for developments and redevelopments requiring
minimal amounts of fill may be waived through a written waiver at the
discretion of the Administrator provided the developer has verified there are
no repetitive loss areas downstream, and there are no adverse impacts resulting
from the following types of development:
      1.   Replacement of on-site septic systems within the floodplain or
floodway provided:
         a.   The existing land use is maintained;
         b.   The volume of fill is the least amount of fill required to
maintain the existing land use;

9-135 of this article.
      2.   Dredging of ditches in the floodplain and non-designated floodway as
long as the dredging spoils are evenly dispersed at a depth of no more than
two-tenths of a foot (0.2') adjacent to the dredging operation;
      3.   Floodproofing of an existing, lawfully habitable residential or
commercial building within ten feet (10') of the outside face of the building
in the floodplain provided the probability of flood damage to other buildings
is not increased;
      4.   Loss of artificially created storage due to a reduction in upstream
head loss caused by replacement of a bridge, culvert, storm sewer, provided
there are no increases to the downstream flows or flood elevation. If increases
to the downstream flows or flood elevation are proposed the following shall be
provided:
         a.   An analysis of the downstream floodplain shall be conducted to
determine whether structures will be at risk of damage. If structures are at
risk of damage, a detailed hydrologic analysis shall be performed to establish
the extent to which the artificial storage decreases flood flows, and the
damages that might be incurred as a result of the loss thereof. Compensatory
storage or mitigation shall be required to the extent necessary to protect the
structures from additional damages; and
         b.   The applicant shall document that the downstream regulatory
entity or Drainage District has been informed.
      5.   Building members (including horizontal and vertical members) for
decks, fences and accessory structures meeting section
9-135 of this article and as constructed within the floodplain;
      6.   Top dressing for the purposes of restoring pre-subsidence grade to
an area that primarily experiences subsidence due to a documented flood event.
Top dressing is the placement of not more than four inches (4") of topsoil or
gravel within the regulatory floodplain. Upon approval of the Administrator,
compensatory storage shall not be required for top dressing provided that it
meets the following:
         a.   This provision shall not be applicable for new developments or
redevelopments;
         b.   Top dressing shall be allowed by permit on a per parcel basis and
not damage or alter adjoining property drainage patterns;
         c.   Top dressing fill shall comply with articles III and VII of this
chapter;
         d.   The restoration fill shall meet pre-subsidence elevations, and
within riverine areas, the pre-subsidence effective regulatory floodplain and
regulatory floodway conveyance shall be maintained;
         e.   Proper documentation shall be submitted as part of the stormwater
management permit application by the applicant and shall be either topographic
information or photographic documentation of the flooding and resulting
subsidence that has occurred on the site;
         f.   Upon completion of top dressing, the applicant shall provide
topographic or photographic documentation of completed work; and
         g.   Repeat top dressing applications are limited to documented flood
events with topographic or photographic evidence of subsidence.
   G.   Compensatory storage shall be operational and functional prior to
placement of fill, structures, or other materials temporarily or permanently
placed in the regulatory floodplain.
   H.   A recorded covenant running with the land is required to maintain the
compensatory storage volume. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-142: FLOODWAY STANDARDS:
The only development in a regulatory floodway or non-designated floodway that
will be allowed are appropriate uses that will not cause an increase in flood
heights or velocities for all flood events up to and including the base flood.
Only those appropriate uses listed below will be allowed in the regulatory
floodway. Development within the floodway will require an approved IDNR-OWR
permit. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, fencing
(including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence), and storage of
materials (except as specifically defined below) as an appropriate use. If the
development is proposed for the regulatory floodway portion of the regulatory
floodplain, the following standards apply in addition to the standards for the
regulatory floodplain:
   A.   Only the construction, modification, repair or replacement of the
following appropriate uses will be allowed in the regulatory floodway:
      1.   Public flood control projects, structures and private improvements
relating to the control of drainage and flooding of existing buildings,
erosion, water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      2.   Water dependent facilities;
      3.   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
      4.   Replacement of existing septic tanks and fields provided:
         a.   All mechanical parts are elevated a minimum of six inches (6")
above the BFE;
         b.   The system is placed within the conveyance shadow of an existing
structure when possible for mounded septic fields;
         c.   The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Administrator that no reasonable alternative location exists on the site
outside of the floodway, and that the fill volume is the minimum amount
necessary to maintain the existing land use; and
         d.   The applicant provides proof of an approved IDNR-OWR permit.
      5.   Underground and overhead utilities if sufficiently floodproofed;
      6.   Recreational facilities such as open space consisting of playing
fields, open pavilions, trail systems and fencing that is publicly owned by a
governmental agency;
      7.   Detached garages, storage sheds, boathouses or other non- habitable
structures without sanitary facilities that are accessory to existing buildings
and will not block flood flows nor reduce regulatory or non-designated floodway
storage;
      8.   Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and railways,
runways and taxiways, required for crossing the regulatory floodway or for
access to other appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway and any
modification thereto;
      9.   Parking lots built at or below existing grade provided that either:
         a.   The BFE is less than one foot (1') above the proposed parking
lot; or
         b.   The parking lot is accessory to short term outdoor recreational
facilities and the applicant agrees to restrict access during periods of
inundation and agrees to accept liability for all damage caused by vehicular
access during flooding events.
      10.   Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
nonerosive slope toward a channel;
      11.   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures or the construction of floodwalls or berms around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall or berm is no more than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of
the existing structure and where such activities are not considered to be a
substantial improvement to the structure, unless the structure then meets
building protection standards. Compensatory storage will be required for any
activities that result in fill in the floodway;
      12.   The repair, replacement or reconstruction of a damaged building or
structure, provided the structure is not considered substantially damaged or
improved and none of the outside dimensions of the building are increased and
such repair, replacement or reconstruction does not constitute a substantial
improvement;
      13.   The repair, replacement, reconstruction or floodproofing of a
building or structure that is substantially damaged or improved is allowed at
its previous location on the site or further outside of the regulatory floodway
provided that:
         a.   The building will meet the building protection standards in
section
9-139 of this article;
         b.   The square footage of the portion of the structure below the
floodplain elevation is not greater than the existing building;
         c.   The width of the building perpendicular to the flow shall be
equal to or less than the existing building width; and
         d.   If demolished, the construction of a replacement building shall
begin within two (2) years of the demolition date. If no construction has begun
prior to this date, a replacement structure will not be considered an
appropriate use in accordance with this section.
      14.   Modifications to an existing building such as fireplaces, bay
windows, decks, patios and second story additions, which do not constitute a
substantial improvement, do not increase the enclosed floor area or livable
space of the building below the BFE and does not block flood flows; no enclosed
floor areas may be built on stilts.
   B.   No change shall be made to the list of appropriate uses without the
prior approval of IDNR-OWR and the committee.
   C.   All development in the regulatory floodway shall require a stormwater
management permit and must be in accordance with all provisions of this
chapter.
   D.   An appropriate use may be permitted if the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data. The Administrator may require the
submittal to be prepared and signed by a professional engineer:
      1.   All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the
development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on-
stream structures or dams, shall be replaced at a 1:1 ratio for all flood
events up to and including the base flood.
      2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used to
determine transition sections in calculations of effective regulatory floodway
conveyance:
         a.   Flowing water will expand no faster than a rate of one foot (1')
horizontally for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
         b.   Flowing water will contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontally for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
         c.   Flowing water will not expand or contract faster than one foot
(1') vertically for every ten feet (10') of the flooded stream's length.
         d.   All cross sections used in the calculations shall be
perpendicular to flood flows.
         e.   Transition sections must be used to determine the effective
floodway conveyance areas on adjacent properties.
      3.   Development of an appropriate use will not result in an increase in
the channel or regulatory floodway erosive velocities or stage. However, in the
case of bridges or culverts or on- stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, erosive velocities
may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will
be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
      4.   In the case of on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water during normal or flood flows, the increase in flood stage when
compared to existing conditions for all storm events up to and including the
base flood event shall be contained within recorded easements or the channel
banks. On- stream structures may increase the BFE within the limits of the
site, but may not increase the BFE on adjacent or upstream properties. A dam
safety permit or letter indicating a dam safety permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR-OWR for such structures. All dams and impoundment structures
shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams).
      5.   If floodproofing construction is required beyond the outside
dimensions of an existing habitable residential or commercial building, the
outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be no further than
ten feet (10') from the building. Compensation for lost storage and floodway
conveyance will be required for floodproofing within the ten foot (10')
perimeter provided the probability of flood damage to other buildings is not
increased.
      6.   IDNR-OWR will issue permits for all IDNR-OWR, State, Federal or
community projects. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-143: NON-DESIGNATED FLOODWAY:
These standards apply to riverine regulatory floodplains with a non-designated
floodway. The applicant shall obtain approval from IDNR-OWR for all
development, any portion of which is located within the regulatory floodplain
(without a delineated regulatory floodway) with a tributary area of six hundred
forty (640) acres or more.
   A.   The development shall not singularly or cumulatively result in an
obstruction of flood flows or potential flood damages outside the site due to
an increase in flood heights, velocities or loss of floodplain area storage.
   B.   A professional engineer shall submit a study that:
      1.   Determines a floodway which meets the definition of a "regulatory
floodway" and demonstrates that the proposed development meets the floodway
standards in sections
9-142 and
9-143 of this article;
      2.   Determines a BFE and demonstrates that the proposed development will
maintain the existing conditions conveyance, will not increase flood
velocities, will not increase flood profiles and will compensate for any lost
floodplain storage in accordance with section
9-142 of this article; or
      3.   Shows that the proposed development will meet the requirements for
regulatory floodplains in sections
9-137 and
9-138 of this article. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-144: BRIDGE AND CULVERT STANDARDS:
These standards are for the construction, reconstruction or modification of
bridges, culvert crossings and roadway approaches located in the regulatory
floodplain:
   A.   A proposed new structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one-tenth of a foot (0.1') when compared to the
existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event unless contained within the channel banks or recorded easements. The one-
tenth of a foot (0.1') increase is allowed for the margin of error in the
model, construction, and survey overall. The evaluation must be submitted to
IDNR-OWR for review and issuance of a permit.
   B.   If the proposed new structure will increase upstream flood stages
greater than one-tenth of a foot (0.1') the applicant must contact IDNR-OWR for
a dam safety permit or waiver. The Administrator shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
   C.   A restrictive bridge or culvert may be altered to increase the
conveyance of the base flood if an impact analysis is completed and approved in
writing by the Administrator and all other required regulatory approvals are
obtained.
   D.   Velocity increases must be mitigated by use of appropriate measures to
avoid scour, erosion and sedimentation at the structure.
   E.   For modification or replacement of existing structures in a regulatory
floodway, the existing structure must first be evaluated in accordance with
IDNR-OWR rules (17 Ill. Adm. Code part 3708) to determine if the existing
structure is a source of flood damage. If the structure is a source of flood
damage, the applicant's engineer shall justify allowing the damage to continue
and evaluate the feasibility of relieving the structure's impact. Modifications
to or replacement of structures, other than a restrictive bridge or culvert
under subsection C of this section, shall not increase flood stages (0.0 feet)
compared to the existing condition for all flood events up to and including the
base flood event. The evaluation must be submitted to IDNR-OWR for review and
approval before a permit is issued. The Administrator shall be copied on all
related correspondence.
   F.   If any work is proposed in, near or over the Fox River, a permit or
letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR-OWR.
   G.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing
the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR-OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required.
   H.   Construction vehicles shall cross streams by the means of existing
bridges or culverts. Where an existing crossing is not available, a temporary
crossing, for which a permit or waiver has been issued by IDNR-OWR, shall be
constructed in which:
      1.   The approach roads will be six inches (6") or less above existing
grade;
      2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the
water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall;
      3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet
(2') below the top of the lowest bank;
      4.   Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel; and
      5.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one
year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the
Administrator. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-145: FLOODPLAIN SUBMITTAL:
The applicant shall obtain approval from IDNR-OWR and FEMA when required for
all new base flood and floodway determinations or as required in section
9-135 of this article. Documentation supporting a finding by the qualified
engineer that the proposed development is compliant with section
9-135 of this article shall be submitted with the stormwater management permit
application. At a minimum, the following materials shall be submitted for

9-169: REQUIREMENTS FOR WETLAND DELINEATION:
   A.   Before any development in or near linear watercourses, nonlinear
waterbodies, or wetlands is permitted, the applicant shall submit a written
report identifying and evaluating the boundaries, location, area, functions and
quality of linear watercourses, nonlinear waterbodies, wetlands, and buffers.
The presence and extent of linear watercourses, nonlinear waterbodies, and
wetlands on the site shall be determined as the result of an on-site
delineation using the following methodology:
      1.   The ordinary high water mark (OHWM) shall be used to delineate all
linear watercourses and nonlinear waterbodies, that are not wetlands;
      2.   All on-site wetlands shall be delineated in accordance with the

current National Food Security Act Manual methodology. Agricultural land that
has been abandoned for five (5) consecutive years shall be delineated in
accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation methodology per
subsection A2 of this section.
   B.   The following areas are not considered to be linear watercourses,
nonlinear waterbodies, or wetlands under this chapter. Documentation is
required to verify the purpose and use of the facility and that the area was
excavated or diked in an upland area. The Director (or Administrator in a
community certified to administer this article) reserves the right on a case-
by-case basis to determine if an area within the categories below shall be
regulated under this chapter:
      1.   Waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or lagoons;
      2.   Drainage, irrigation, agricultural, and roadside ditches excavated
in upland areas;
      3.   Areas with artificial hydrology, including but not limited to drain
tile breaks, irrigation, or detention storage facility outlets which would
revert to upland if the tile were repaired or irrigation were to cease;
      4.   Artificial nonlinear waterbodies or wetlands created by excavating
and/or diking upland areas to collect and retain water and which are used
exclusively for such purposes as stormwater storage, stock watering,
irrigation, industrial cooling systems, settling basins, sediment traps, or
primarily aesthetic purposes;
      5.   Water filled depressions created in upland areas incidental to
construction activity; and
      6.   Pits or quarries excavated in upland areas for the purpose of
obtaining fill, stone, aggregate, sand, or gravel unless and until the
construction or excavation operation is abandoned for a period of five (5)
years or more and the resulting body of water meets the definition of waters of
the U.S. or wetlands.
   C.   Wetland delineations under this section shall be valid for five (5)
years.
   D.   Delineations for permitting purposes may be performed outside the
growing season when site conditions allow. FQI assessments made before May 1st
or after October 15th shall be considered preliminary.
   E.   The approximate location, extent and relative quality of off- site
linear watercourses, nonlinear waterbodies and wetlands within one hundred feet
(100') of the site shall be identified and included in the written report. The
location and extent of such, at the time of development, shall be determined by
using the following hierarchy:
      1.   Site-specific delineation in accordance with the current Federal
wetland delineation methodology;
      2.   Wetlands identified in Watershed Plans or ADID studies;
      3.   Wetlands identified in Interim Watershed Plans; or
      4.   Wetlands identified on USFWS National Wetlands Inventory maps.
   F.   The quality of the wetlands shall be evaluated based upon the FQI. The
FQI shall be based solely on the wetland vegetation. Buffers and adjacent plant
communities shall not be included in the calculation.
   G.   The presence of any Federally or State listed threatened and endangered
species on-site shall be determined. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)

in a community certified to administer this article) determines that the
facility meets the standards he shall release the performance security. If the
Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this article)
determines that the facility does not meet the standards he shall make an
estimate of the probable cost of mitigating for the shortfall in performance.
The Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article) shall reduce so much of the performance security to cash as is
required to mitigate for the shortfall in performance and shall release the
remainder. The amount withheld for mitigation shall be deposited in the fund
created under and expended in the manner described in section
9-179 of this article. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-177: BUFFER REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Applicability:
      1.   The requirements of this section are applicable to:
         a.   Areas in conservation or drainage easements that were established
under this chapter for the purpose of protecting, enhancing or reestablishing a
buffer shall be preserved in accordance with subsection B of this section and
if disturbed, shall be re-established;
         b.   Developments that require a stormwater management permit per
section
9-28 of this chapter but do not require a detention storage facility per
subsection
9-81B of this chapter shall meet subsection B of this section; and
         c.   Developments that require a detention storage facility per
subsection
9-81B of this chapter shall meet subsection B of this section. If disturbance
is proposed within a buffer on the site, the area within the defined width per
subsection B of this section that does not currently meet the definition of a
buffer shall be assessed for potential buffer functions. Areas that have high
potential to provide buffer functions shall be re- established in accordance
with subsection C of this section. Such areas include, but are not limited to:
            (1)   Agricultural land within the defined width currently in
production that are tributary to the linear watercourse, nonlinear waterbody,
or wetland;
            (2)   Maintained turf or landscape areas within the defined width
that are tributary to the linear watercourse, nonlinear waterbody, or wetland;
            (3)   Fallow or unmaintained areas within the defined width
dominated by invasive species that are tributary to the linear watercourse,
nonlinear waterbody, or wetland;
            (4)   Redevelopment areas within the defined width that propose
removal of buildings, structures or impervious surface in an area that is
tributary to the linear watercourse, nonlinear waterbody, or wetland; or
            (5)   Areas within the defined width that are not tributary to, but
provide ground water recharge, to the linear watercourse, nonlinear waterbody,
or wetland.
      2.   The requirements of this section are not applicable to:
         a.   Redevelopment projects on sites adjacent to the main channel of
the Fox River; or
         b.   Isolated wetlands or waters of the U.S. that, in either case, are
below the threshold size limitations for mitigation requirements under the
USACE section 404 permit program (currently, less than 0.10 acre);
         c.   Roadside and agricultural drainage ditches that do not meet the
definition of a wetland or waters of the U.S.;
         d.   Swales that do not have a defined bed and bank that do not meet
the definition of a wetland or waters of the U.S.; and
         e.   Public roadway crossings and their associated installations.
   B.   Buffers:
      1.   A buffer shall not constitute a linear watercourse, nonlinear
waterbody or wetland.
      2.   Buffer widths required as a part of a USACE section 404 permit
supersede the widths required in this section, unless the width required herein
is greater. If a USACE permit is obtained to permanently fill a portion of a
wetland and no buffer is required, the buffer width required by this chapter
immediately adjacent to the area of impact does not apply. "Immediately
adjacent" refers to the area within fifteen feet (15') of the area of impact,
which may be used to transition from no buffer to the required width. In no
case shall additional wetland area be filled to provide buffer required by this
chapter.
      3.   Buffer areas are divided into two (2) types, linear buffers and
water body buffers. The buffer area for all linear watercourses and nonlinear
waterbodies, except wetlands, shall extend from the OHWM. The buffer area for
wetlands shall extend from the edge of the approved delineated wetland
boundary.
      4.   A site may contain buffer that originates from a linear watercourse,
nonlinear waterbody or wetland located on another property.
      5.   Buffer widths are to be fifty feet (50') wide unless otherwise
determined using the criteria specified in this section.
         a.   Linear buffers shall be designated along linear watercourses and
associated wetlands (i.e., swales, creeks, streams, rivers, etc.). Refer to
this section where wetlands are adjacent to and not part of the main channel
(i.e., floodplain wetland, backwater slough, oxbow, bordering wetland complex).
The minimum buffer width for all linear watercourses and associated wetlands
shall be:
            (1)   Determined utilizing the formula, X = (A * 0.0547) + 30,
where "X" equals the buffer width in feet and "A" equals the drainage area in
acres when the linear watercourse has a drainage area less than six hundred
forty (640) acres, measured at the downstream property line. The width
calculated by this formula shall be rounded up to the nearest multiple of five
(5). Subsection I,
figure 9-177.1 of this section may be used to determine buffer widths provided
the resultant width is increased to the nearest multiple of five (5);
            (2)   Fifty feet (50') when the linear watercourse has a drainage
area greater than six hundred forty (640) acres, measured at the downstream
property line, or is designated as ADID because of high habitat value or an
adjacent wetland has a calculated FQI greater than sixteen (16); or
            (3)   One hundred feet (100') when the linear watercourse is rated
A or B for diversity or integrity or is mapped as biologically significant by
the current edition of "Integrating Multiple Taxa in a Biological Stream Rating
System" by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.
         b.   Water body buffers shall encompass nonlinear waterbodies meeting
the definition of waters of the U.S., and wetlands that are not part of the
main channel of a linear watercourse. The buffer width shall be based upon the
FQI of the wetland. Buffer requirements based upon preliminary FQI assessments
per subsection
9-169F of this article shall not be considered final unless maximum buffer
widths are assumed. The minimum buffer width shall be:
            (1)   Fifteen feet (15') and a maximum of thirty five feet (35'),
in accordance with subsection I,
table 9-177.2 of this section, for all wetlands with a FQI of less than seven
(7) and nonlinear waterbodies that do not have associated wetlands;
            (2)   Fifteen feet (15') and a maximum of fifty feet (50'), in
accordance with subsection I,
table 9-177.3 of this section, for all wetlands with a FQI of seven (7) to
sixteen (16);
            (3)   Thirty feet (30') and a maximum of fifty feet (50'), in
accordance with subsection I,
table 9-177.4 of this section, for all wetlands with a FQI greater than sixteen
(16) to twenty five (25); or
            (4)   One hundred feet (100') for all wetlands with a FQI greater
than twenty five (25).
         c.   If protective measures are installed along the perimeter of a
buffer, the width may be reduced by up to ten percent (10%) immediately
adjacent to the protective measure. The reduction in width that may be applied
due to installation of protective measures may not be applied where buffer
width averaging has been used and the buffer would be more than fifty percent
(50%) less than originally specified. Protective measures may consist of
fencing, native vegetated detention storage facilities, BMPs or other methods
approved by the Administrator.
      6.   Buffer width averaging is acceptable at the discretion of the
Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article). If buffer width averaging is proposed:
         a.   The width may not be more than fifty percent (50%) less, at the
narrowest point, than the required width;
         b.   The width may never be less than fifteen feet (15'); and
         c.   High potential buffer function areas may be re-established to
meet buffer averaging requirements for developments meeting subsection A1c of
this section, upon approval by the Director (or Administrator in a community
certified to administer this article).
   C.   Buffer (Re)Establishment: Buffer (re)establishment includes
revegetation of the required buffer per subsection A of this section using the
width determined per subsection B of this section with predominately native
deep-rooted vegetation.
      1.   If buffer (re)establishment is required, a buffer establishment plan
shall be submitted in accordance with section
9-180 of this article.
      2.   The buffer shall be appropriately managed and maintained in
accordance with the following:
         a.   Buffer (re)establishment areas less than five thousand (5,000)
square feet, cumulatively on-site, shall:
            (1)   Meet the following performance standards:
               (A)   All proposed vegetated areas shall achieve eighty five
percent (85%) cover; and
               (B)   All proposed vegetated areas shall not be dominated by or
contain cumulatively more than twenty five percent (25%) cover by non-native or
invasive species.
            (2)   Within one year of the completion of the development a
qualified wetland specialist retained by the developer shall verify compliance
with this section in a report submitted to the Director (or Administrator in a
community certified to administer this article);
            (3)   Make a request for the release of the performance security to
the Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article) once the buffer (re)establishment areas meet the performance
standards. A release of the performance security may be requested as early as
the end of the first full growing season following planting; and
            (4)   Be maintained in accordance with article IX of this chapter
at the end of the monitoring and management period, or upon acceptance by the
Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article).
         b.   Buffer (re)establishment areas greater than five thousand (5,000)
square feet, cumulatively on the site, shall:
            (1)   Meet the following performance standards:
               (A)   All proposed vegetated areas shall achieve eighty five
percent (85%) cover;
               (B)   All proposed vegetated areas shall achieve a minimum FQI
of ten (10) within the three (3) year monitoring period; and
               (C)   All proposed vegetated areas shall not be dominated or
contain cumulatively more than ten percent (10%) cover by non-native or
invasive species.
            (2)   Be monitored and managed for three (3) years beginning on the
day planting is completed;
            (3)   Be monitored via meander method or transect method in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the current Chicago District
protocol promulgated by USACE;
            (4)   Provide an annual report to the Director (or Administrator in
a community certified to administer this article) by February 15th of each year
for every buffer (re)establishment area under permit;
            (5)   Make a request for the release of the performance security to
the Director (or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article) once the buffer reaches its required FQI and meets the performance
standards. A release of the performance security may be requested as early as
the end of the second full growing season; and
            (6)   Be maintained in accordance with article IX of this chapter
at the end of the three (3) year monitoring and management period, or upon
acceptance by the Director (or Administrator in a community certified to
administer this article).
      3.   At the end of the three (3) year monitoring period for a buffer
(re)establishment area greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet, or upon
an earlier request for the release of the performance security, the Director
(or Administrator in a community certified to administer this article) shall
evaluate the buffer for compliance with the performance standards. The Director
or Administrator may review the annual monitoring reports and/or perform a site
visit to make this evaluation. If the Director or Administrator determines that
the buffer (re)establishment area meets the standards he shall release the
performance security. If the Director or Administrator determines that the
buffer (re)establishment area does not meet the standards he shall make an
estimate of the probable cost of mitigating for the shortfall in performance.
The Director or Administrator shall reduce so much of the performance security
to cash as is required to mitigate for the shortfall in performance and shall
release the remainder. The amount withheld shall be deposited in the fund
created under and expended in the manner described in section
9-179 of this article .
   D.   Stormwater Management Facilities: Stormwater management measures shall
not require a buffer but may constitute buffer. The total width of the buffer
required may not be reduced by the installation of a stormwater management
measure unless they can be considered a protective measure, then the width of
the buffer may be reduced as specified in subsection B5c of this section.
   E.   Disturbed During Construction: If a buffer area is disturbed during
construction, the buffer shall be re-established in accordance with subsection
C of this section.
   F.   Access Allowed When Necessary: Access through buffer areas shall be
allowed when necessary for maintenance purposes. Unless otherwise dedicated for
a public purpose, buffer areas shall remain private property and are not
generally accessible to the public.
   G.   Discharge Through Buffer: Undetained stormwater which has not passed
through a detention storage facility shall discharge through a BMP or buffer
before entering a linear watercourse, nonlinear waterbody or wetland.
   H.   Free From Development Once Established:
      1.   All buffer areas once established shall be maintained free from
development, except as follows:
         a.   A buffer area may be used for passive recreation (e.g.,
birdwatching, walking, jogging, bicycling, horseback riding and picnicking) and
it may contain pedestrian, bicycle or equestrian trails, provided that the
created path is no wider than the width required for the designated use by the
AASHTO Guide for Development of Bicycle Facilities, current edition. If the
path leads to a wetland, it must be a winding path to help prevent erosion;
         b.   Accessory structures (i.e., toolshed) and impervious surfaces may
occupy a maximum of fifteen percent (15%) of the portion of the required buffer
that extends onto or is part of a site;
         c.   Below and above ground utilities shall be allowed provided all
other Federal, State and local regulations are met;
         d.   Utility maintenance, and maintenance of drainage facilities and
drainage easements shall be allowed provided the maintenance activity meets all
other Federal, State and local regulations; and
         e.   Anchoring and placement of boat docks and piers shall be allowed
provided the structure meets all other Federal, State and local regulations.
      2.   Buffer areas including the protected linear watercourses, nonlinear
waterbodies and wetlands shall be shown to be within appropriate easements on
all new plats. Additionally, the stormwater management permit number, and any
associated maintenance requirements shall be noted on the plat or included as a
covenant running with the land in any deed which conveys any portion of a
buffer area.
      3.   An easement over buffer areas for projects meeting the requirements
of subsection C2a of this section is not required. A Declaration of Restriction
and Covenant that acknowledges the presence of linear watercourses, nonlinear
waterbodies, wetlands and buffers on-site, the stormwater management permit
number, and any associated maintenance requirements. However, an easement per
subsection H2 of this section may be required at the discretion of the
Administrator.

   B.   If mitigation credits are available from any wetland mitigation bank,
the applicant shall also prepare a statement of the estimated probable cost of
satisfying the mitigation requirement through the purchase of credits from a
wetland mitigation bank (which estimate is subject to the approval of the
Director [or Administrator in a community certified to administer this
article]) as if the applicant had chosen to satisfy the mitigation requirement
in such manner.
   C.   The fee in lieu of wetland mitigation to be paid under this section
shall be the greater of subsection A or B of this section. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-
2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-180: WETLAND SUBMITTAL:
   A.   The applicant shall obtain a permit for all Federally regulated
activities involving waters of the U.S. from the appropriate Federal
authorities. The applicant shall obtain a permit from the County (or community
certified to administer this article), for all developments having a wetland
impact or that modify a linear watercourse or nonlinear waterbody.
   B.   If the development proposes a wetland impact or modification to a
linear watercourse or nonlinear waterbody, the requirements of this article
shall be met and a wetland submittal shall be required. The submittal shall
include all of the following information:
      1.   A written report containing:
         a.   A wetland delineation report (USACE format);
         b.   Calculation of the required buffer width for each linear

      4.   That is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; or
      5.   As required by the Administrator.
   C.   Each letter of credit shall provide that:
      1.   It is irrevocable;
      2.   The consent of the applicant is not required prior to its
presentment for payment; and
      3.   If at any time it will expire within forty five (45) or any lesser
number of days, and if it has not been renewed and the renewal submitted to the
Administrator, and if any obligation of the applicant for which it stands as
security remains uncompleted or is unsatisfactory, then the Administrator may,
without notice and without being required to take any further action of any
nature whatsoever, present the letter of credit for payment and thereafter
either hold all proceeds as security for the satisfactory completion of all
such obligations or employ the proceeds to complete all such obligations and
reimburse the permitting authority for any and all costs and expenses,
including legal fees and administrative costs, incurred by the permitting
authority.
   D.   If the Administrator at any time determines that the amount of the
letter of credit is not, or may not be, sufficient to pay in full the remaining
unpaid cost of the construction of all stormwater facilities or the
installation and maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control
practices, then, within ten (10) days following a demand by the Administrator,
the applicant shall increase the amount of the letter of credit to the amount
determined by the Administrator to be sufficient to pay such unpaid costs.
Failure to increase the amount of the letter of credit shall be grounds for the
Administrator to present the letter of credit for payment.
   E.   If at any time the Administrator determines that the bank issuing the
letter of credit is without assets of at least ten million dollars
($10,000,000.00), is unable to meet any Federal or State requirement for
reserves, is insolvent, is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is
otherwise in danger of being unable to honor such letter of credit at any time
during its term, or if the Administrator otherwise reasonably deems the
permitting authority to be insecure, then the Administrator shall have the
right to demand that the applicant provide a replacement letter of credit from
a bank meeting the requirements of this section. Such replacement letter of
credit shall be deposited with the Administrator not less than ten (10) days
following such demand. Upon such deposit, the Administrator shall surrender the
original letter of credit to the applicant.
   F.   If the applicant fails or refuses to fully meet any of its obligations
under this chapter then the Administrator may, in his or her discretion,
present the letter for payment and thereafter either hold all proceeds as
security for the satisfactory completion of all such obligations or employ the
proceeds to complete all such obligations or otherwise mitigate the effects of
such failure or refusal and may reimburse the permitting authority for any and
all costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative costs, incurred
by the permitting authority. If as a result of such default, the remaining
amount of the letter of credit is less than the amount otherwise required to be
then maintained under this article, then the applicant shall, upon demand of
the Administrator therefor, immediately deposit with the Administrator such
additional funds as the Administrator determines to be required to be then
maintained. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)

to adequately carry out its duties, the Administrator will require, as a
condition of approving of any application for a stormwater management permit,
the establishment of a special service area pursuant to 35 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 200/27-5 et seq., either as the primary means of providing for the
long-term maintenance of these areas, or as a backup vehicle in the event the
person designated by the applicant as having primary maintenance responsibility
fails to adequately carry out its duties. If the establishment of a special
service area is required, the Administrator shall make a good faith estimate of
the tax rate required to produce a tax to be levied upon all taxable property
within the area, sufficient for the long term maintenance of these areas and
submit the same to the permitting authority which shall incorporate such rate
into its enactment of the ordinances necessary for the establishment of the
area. The ordinances to be enacted by the permitting authority shall be
substantially in the form set forth in article XVII, appendix D of this
chapter. On or before August 1st of each year thereafter, the Administrator
shall submit to the permitting authority a good faith estimate of the amount of
tax required to be levied upon all taxable property within the area for the

An application for a variance, signed by at least one of the persons identified
in section
9-31 of this chapter with respect to the development to which it relates, shall
be filed with the Administrator. No application for a variance will be accepted
for filing unless it relates to a previously or contemporaneously filed
application for a stormwater management permit. Applications for a variance
shall be filed in such number of duplicate copies as the Administrator may
designate by administrative order. No action will be taken on an application
for a variance unless it and the corresponding application for a stormwater
management permit to which it relates are complete as determined by the
Administrator. The Administrator shall send a copy of the complete application
to the Director and to all other communities within the same watershed.
Applications for a variance need not be made upon any specific form, but shall
contain the information set forth as follows:
   A.   Application For Variance: An application for variance shall set forth:
      1.   The common address(es) and legal description of the site;
      2.   The persons identified in section 9-31 of this chapter;
      3.   The names and addresses of all consultants retained in connection
with the application for a variance;
      4.   The names and addresses of all owners of record of land within two
hundred fifty feet (250') of the site;
      5.   The specific feature or features of the development that require a
variance;
      6.   The specific provisions of this chapter from which a variance is
sought and the precise extent of the variance therefrom;
      7.   A statement of the characteristics of the development that prevent
compliance with the provisions of this chapter;
      8.   A statement that the variance requested is the minimum variance
necessary to permit the development; and
      9.   A statement as to how the variance requested satisfies the standards
set forth in section
9-260 of this article. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-258: APPLICATION FEE:
With the filing of the application for a variance, the applicant shall pay a
fee to be prescribed by separate ordinance by the certified community. (Ord.
19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-259: PUBLIC HEARING:
When the application is complete, the Administrator will so notify the
applicant and will schedule a public hearing on the application before the
oversight committee. Notice of the hearing shall be published as provided in
section
9-317 of this chapter and served as provided in section
9-316 of this chapter upon the applicant, the Director, all owners of record of
land within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the site as disclosed in the
application, and upon each community within the same watershed as the
development. The notices given under this section shall set forth the common
name, address and legal description of the development and a brief description
of the variance as requested. (Ord. 19-151, 5-7-2019, eff. 6-1-2019)
9-260: GRANTING OF VARIANCES:
   A.   The oversight committee shall not recommend nor shall the decision-
making authority grant a variance from the provisions of this chapter unless
the variance is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and meets the
following standards based upon substantial evidence submitted at the hearing:
      1.   The variance will not increase the probability of flood damage or
create an additional threat to the public health, safety, and welfare.
      2.   The variance is the minimum required considering each of the
following statements of policy underlying this chapter and there are no means
other than the requested variance by which the demonstrated hardship can be
avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit the reasonable
continuation of the development:
         a.   Detention storage facility shall also contribute to the
improvement of the quality of stormwater runoff.
         b.   The volume provided in open air vegetated detention storage
facilities is maximized consistent with other site constraints on land use,
including zoning requirements essential for the proposed development.
         c.   Conveyance of stormwater shall not disproportionately absorb the
design capacity of existing off-site conveyance facilities for any storm event
from the fifty percent (50%) design storm to the one percent (1%) design storm.
         d.   High quality natural areas shall be preserved on the site,
including, without limitation, stands of native trees, existing wetlands,
natural floodplain storage or other valuable environmental and biological
resources.
      3.   The variance is not requested solely for the purpose of increasing
the density of the development nor impervious areas on the site.
      4.   The variance is not requested solely as a result of economic
hardship.
      5.   If applicable, the variance is required due to unique, natural
topographical features of the site.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are not self-imposed.
   B.   Variances requested in connection with the restoration of a historic
structure may be granted using criteria more permissive than those set forth
above provided that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the historic structure; and
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure no
longer meeting the definition of a "historic structure" under this chapter.
   C.   No variance shall be granted for any development in the regulatory
floodway, or waters of the U.S. or wetlands, the effect of which would be to
create regulations less restrictive than the Federal or State minimum standards
applicable to development in such areas.

10.5-21: SHORT TITLE:
This article shall be known as the KANE COUNTY COMMUNITY ANTENNA TELEVISION
ORDINANCE and is passed pursuant to the authority set forth in 55 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/5-1095, as amended, which are incorporated herein and made
part hereof. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)
DIVISION 1A. PREAMBLE
10.5-22: PREAMBLE:
Whereas, the county of Kane ("county") is granted the power to license,
franchise, and tax operators of community antenna television systems pursuant
to section 5/5-1095 of the Illinois statutes; and
Whereas, the county believes that it is in the best interest of the county and
the public to have competition in the provision of video programming services
within the county and the county desires to encourage competition among
providers of video programming to the extent permitted by law; and
Whereas, the county is granted the power to franchise operators of cable
systems and open video systems pursuant to title 47 of the United States Code,
as amended; and
Whereas, the public rights of way represent a limited resource, and the county
has a duty to ensure that they are used, repaired, and maintained in a manner
that best serves the public health, safety, and welfare and the public
interest; and
Whereas, cable systems and open video systems advance the public health,
safety, and welfare through the use of the rights of way, which are public
property, to provide video programming; and
Whereas, the purpose and intent of this chapter is for the county to exercise
its full and complete authority, granted by state and federal law, to license,
franchise, and tax the business of operating a community antenna television
system ("CATV system"). To the extent either state or federal law is found to
provide broader authority, the powers exercised herein shall be deemed to be
based on the broadest grant of authority; and
Whereas, requiring CATV system operators to obtain a franchise prior to
constructing such systems and also requiring the county to act expeditiously on
any franchise request, allows the county to ensure that the preceding
objectives and others which are in the public interest are met, while allowing
expanded competition and the prompt provision of service.
Now, therefore be it ordained by the president and board of commissioners of
the county of Kane, Illinois, as follows. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-
2008)

compensation for promotion or exhibition of any products or services on the
holder's network, such as a "home shopping" or similar channel, subject to
subsection I of this definition.
   I.   In the case of a cable service or video service that is bundled or
integrated functionally with other services, capabilities, or applications, the
portion of the grantee's or the holder's revenue attributable to the other
services, capabilities, or applications shall be included in gross revenue
unless the grantee or the holder can reasonably identify the division or
exclusion of the revenue from its books and records that are kept in the
regular course of business.
   J.   The franchise fee or service provider fee permitted under this article.
Gross revenues do not include any of the following:
   A.   Revenues not actually received, even if billed, such as bad debt.
   B.   Refunds, discounts, or other price adjustments that reduce the amount
of gross revenues received by the grantee or the holder to the extent the
refund, rebate, credit, or discount is attributable to cable service or video
service.
   C.   Regardless of whether the services are bundled, packaged, or
functionally integrated with cable service or video service, any revenues
received from services not classified as cable service or video service,
including, without limitation, revenue received from telecommunications
services, information services, or the provision of directory or internet
advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner advertisement, and
electronic publishing or any other revenues attributed by the grantee or the
holder to noncable service or nonvideo service in accordance with the grantee's
or the holder's books and records and records kept in the regular course of
business and any applicable laws, rules, regulations, standards, or orders.
   D.   The sale of cable service or video services for resale in which the

   G.   Amounts paid by subscribers to "home shopping" or similar vendors for
merchandise sold through any home shopping channel offered as part of the cable
service or video service. Revenue of an affiliate of a grantee or a holder
shall be included in the calculation of gross revenues to the extent the
treatment of the revenue as revenue of the affiliate rather than the grantee or
the holder has the effect of evading the payment of the fee permitted by this
article which would otherwise be paid by the cable service or video service
provider.
As used herein, "annual gross revenues" shall mean gross revenues attributable
to a twelve (12) month accounting period, or portion thereof. This definition
of gross revenues shall be the basis for computing the franchise fees imposed

accounting principles ("GAAP"), to the extent not in conflict with this
chapter; provided however, that if GAAP, as of the effective date hereof, would

then such category shall be included in gross revenues notwithstanding the
application of GAAP to the calculation.

submission, or, in the event that the county and the applicant have agreed to
an extension of time for review, the county board shall either approve or deny
the application no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of

eff. 9-1-2008)
10.5-43: GRANT OF FRANCHISE:
   A.   The county may grant a franchise for all or any defined portion of the
county; provided, however, that where a second CATV franchise is granted, the

commercial impracticability, and provided in writing to the county board, may
decline to serve a portion of its franchise area. In order to serve those areas
of the county not served by the incumbent CATV grantee, the county may grant a
franchise to a different incumbent CATV grantee serving areas adjacent to the
unserved area in question, or it may also grant a franchise to a competitive
franchise applicant seeking to serve the unserved area.
   C.   The franchise area shall be the entire area defined in the franchise
agreement. The development department shall define a particular geographic area
in which an individual franchise is to be exercised. Such geographical area
shall be within a county unincorporated franchise area. In the event of an
annexation of all or part of a particular county unincorporated franchise area,
the provisions of 55 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5-1095, as amended, shall
apply.
   D.   A grant of franchise shall require an affirmative vote of a majority of
all members of the county board then holding office on a resolution authorizing
execution of the franchise agreement.
   E.   In the event that the county shall grant a nonexclusive, revocable
franchise to construct, operate, maintain, and reconstruct a CATV system within
the franchise area, said franchise shall constitute both a right and obligation
to provide the services of a CATV system as required by the provisions of this
article and the franchise agreement. Any franchise granted under the provisions
hereof shall be consistent with state and federal laws and regulations to the
extent constitutionally required, and shall be consistent with local ordinances
and regulations from time to time enacted and amended.
   F.   In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the
franchise agreement and the statutes of the county applicable to the granting
of a franchise, then the statutory requirements shall, without exception,
control interpretation, amplification, and clarification of statutory
requirements found in the franchise agreement and shall not be considered a
conflict.
   G.   No CATV system shall be allowed to occupy or use the rights of way
located in the franchise area other than in accordance with this article and a
franchise granted pursuant hereto. A CATV system shall, at all times, be in
compliance with the policies for use of the rights of way as such policies are
promulgated by the Kane County department of transportation (KDOT).
   H.   The requirements for the granting of franchises established by this
article may be modified from time to time to reflect changes in law,
regulation, or technology. Such requirements shall be applied to franchises
then in effect at the time such modified requirements are enacted pursuant to
police powers or as permitted by the franchise agreement. Any modified
requirements shall be applicable to any renewed franchise agreement. Any CATV
franchise shall be nonexclusive. The county specifically reserves the right to
grant, at any time, and in a manner consistent with then applicable law, such
additional franchises in the same geographical area granted to an incumbent
grantee in accordance with the provisions of 55 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5-
1095(e)(1-5), or for any other geographical area within unincorporated Kane
County. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)
10.5-44: TERM OF THE FRANCHISE:
   A.   The term of any new or renewed franchise and all rights, privileges,
obligations, and reservations pertaining thereto shall be as established in the
franchise agreement, unless terminated sooner as hereafter provided.
   B.   A franchise shall take effect and be in full effect from and after
acceptance by the grantee, and the same shall continue in full force and effect
for the term specified in the franchise agreement unless otherwise terminated
or revoked as allowed pursuant to the provisions of this article. (Ord. 08-252,
8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)
10.5-45: PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SESSION:
   A.   The county and grantee may hold performance evaluation sessions at any
time during the term of the franchise agreement. All such evaluation sessions
shall be open to the public. At such time that the county seeks to hold a
performance evaluation session, it shall notify the grantee in writing at least
sixty (60) days in advance of each of the specified performance evaluation
meetings. In the event that any such performance evaluation session is not
held, for any reason, as scheduled, it may be held at such a later date as the
county shall select, after thirty (30) days' written notice to grantee.
   B.   Special evaluation sessions may be held from time to time during the
term of the franchise for just cause, at the request of the county or the
grantee.
   C.   All evaluations shall be open to the public and announced in a
newspaper of general circulation at least once ten (10) days prior to said
session. Where possible, the county shall notify subscribers of all evaluation
sessions, by announcements on local government access channels on the system
that serve the unincorporated areas of the county for five (5) consecutive days
immediately preceding each meeting.
   D.   Topics to be addressed may include issues related to the grantee's CATV
system performance and franchise requirements. A grantee may request a copy of
the agenda for any such session to the extent that said agenda is available to
the public. In addition, the county may provide to the grantee, in advance of
the publication of the agenda, a review of topics or a listing of questions in
order to solicit specific questions from the grantee and enable the grantee to
provide more complete answers than would have been possible without advance
prompting.
   E.   During a review and evaluation by the county, the grantee shall
cooperate with the county and shall provide such information and documents as
the county deems necessary to reasonably perform its review.
   F.   If at any time during its review, or within thirty (30) days of a
scheduled review, the county determines that reasonable evidence exists of
inadequate CATV system performance, it may require the grantee to perform tests
and analyses directed toward the suspected inadequacies in accordance with the
standards set forth in section
10.5-140 of this chapter.
   G.   If, at the conclusion of the performance evaluation, the county makes
specific, written findings of fact that show that the grantee has not fully
complied with the requirements of this chapter, or a franchise agreement, and
has failed to correct such violation after a written notice and opportunity to
cure has been provided, the county may assess penalties under this chapter for
such violation or violations of this chapter so identified by the performance
evaluation. Such penalties shall be assessed in accordance with the procedure
for ordinance violations established in section
10.5-123 of this chapter. In the event that a violation or violations of a
franchise agreement have been identified, any sanctions or liquidated damages
shall be assessed in accordance with the procedures for franchise violations as
described in the franchise agreement.
   H.   The county and the grantee may jointly discuss the cost of performance
sessions. The parties may split the cost of such performance sessions equally.
Costs may include, but are not limited to, legal fees, publication costs, costs
for financial review of the grantee's books and records, system technical
analysis, subscriber surveys, and other costs directly attributable to the

10.5-50: INTERCONNECTION WITH OTHER FRANCHISES OR VIDEO PROVIDERS:
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the state of Illinois and
the FCC, in the event that two (2) different incumbent cable providers serve
contiguous franchise areas within the county, an incumbent cable provider and a
competitive cable provider serve the same franchise area, or a holder and an
incumbent cable provider serve the same territory of the county, then the
affected parties shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks,
if needed, for the purpose of providing public, education, and government
programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by direct cable, microwave
link, satellite, or other reasonable method of connection. The affected parties
shall provide interconnection of the public, education, and government channels
on reasonable terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection.
If the affected parties cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection
agreement, the county may require the incumbent grantee to allow the other
grantee or the holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent grantee's
network at a technically feasible point on their networks. If no technically
feasible point for interconnection is available, the other grantee or the
holder and an incumbent grantee shall each make an interconnection available to
the public, education, and government channel originators at their local
origination points and shall provide the facilities necessary for the
interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by the other
grantee or a holder unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The
interconnection required by this section shall be completed within ninety (90)
days from the receipt of written notice from the county that the systems of
both grantees or the incumbent grantee and the holder must be interconnected.

business hours, at grantee's or holder's principal business office in the
county, the county or its designee shall have the right to inspect and audit in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS), the grantee's
financial records used to calculate the grantee's franchise fees or a holder's
service provider fees; provided, however, that any such inspection or audit
shall take place within five (5) years from the date the county receives such
payment, after which period any such payment shall be considered final.
Information on individual subscribers necessary for the conducting of franchise
fee audits shall not be subject to the disclosure limitations of 47 USC section
551.
   B.   Audit Report: Upon completion of any such audit by the county or its
designee, the county shall provide to the grantee or the holder a final report
setting forth the county's findings in detail, including any and all
substantiating documentation. In the event of an alleged underpayment, the
grantee shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the report to provide
the county with a written response agreeing to or refuting the results of the
audit, including any substantiating documentation. Based on these reports and
responses, the parties shall agree upon a "finally settled amount".

"finally settled amount(s)" shall mean the agreed upon underpayment or
overpayment, if any, to the county by the grantee or the holder as a result of
any such audit. If the parties cannot agree on a "finally settled amount",
either party may bring an action to have the disputed amount determined by a
court of law. The grantee, the holder, or the county shall pay any "finally
settled amount(s)" as a result of such audit within thirty (30) days from the
date the parties agree upon the "finally settled amount". Once the parties
agree upon a "finally settled amount" and the grantee, the holder, or the

challenge the payment for that period.
   D.   Time Of Availability; Expense Of Audit: The audit of books and records
must be available for audit within thirty (30) days of the grantee or the
holder receiving notice of the audit by the county. The county shall bear the
expense of its audit of the grantee's or the holder's books and records,
however if the amount due by grantee is greater than five percent (5%) then
grantee or holder shall pay the expense of the audit.
   E.   Payment: No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord
that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance
of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the county may have for
further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this section. (Ord.

In those cases where the county rights of way are fully or partially located in
municipalities and such rights of way are not maintained by the municipality,
but are instead maintained by the county, the grantee or the holder shall pay a
franchise fee or a service provider fee based upon the following schedule:
   A.   Right of way is located one hundred percent (100%) within the

based upon the percentages expressed in subsections A through E of this
section, and notify the grantee and the holder in writing no less than one
hundred twenty (120) days prior to the start of the grantee's or the holder's

   A.   Standard Of Allocation: A grantee shall provide, at a minimum, cable
programming in the following broad categories: children, general entertainment,
family oriented, ethnic/minority, arts, culture, sports, weather, educational
and performing arts, news and information. Except as expressly permitted by
law, the grantee shall not exercise any editorial control over the content of
programming on the access channels.
   B.   Universal Subscriber Service: Unless otherwise required by applicable
law, or a franchise agreement, a grantee shall make cable service available
throughout unincorporated Kane County in accordance with section
10.5-142, "Line Extension", of this chapter. Where density and proximity
requirements provided in section
10.5-142 of this chapter have been met and applicable right of entry agreements
have been received, a grantee shall not exclude any multiple dwelling unit
facilities located in unincorporated Kane County from having the ability to
receive cable services, including, but not limited to, apartment buildings,
mobile home parks, condominium complexes (including duplexes, townhouses and
row houses), co-ops, and senior citizen congregate housing. Nothing prevents a
grantee from recouping from a property management firm the reasonable expenses
necessary to serve the facility. The county acknowledges that a grantee cannot
control the dissemination of particular cable services beyond the point of
demarcation for a multiple dwelling unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
grantee may introduce new or expanded cable services on a geographically phased
basis, where such services require a change in technology of the cable system.
   C.   Access Programming: Use of channel capacity for access programming
shall be provided on the most basic tier of service offered by grantee in
accordance with section 611 of the cable act (47 USC section 531), or on a
mutually agreed upon tier of service. A grantee shall designate one channel on
its CATV system for the use of the county for the purpose of providing
government access programming if the county requests a channel during the term
of a franchise agreement. In the event that the county ceases programming on
the government access channel in its entirety, the county shall recognize a
grantee's proprietary interest in and control of the channel, and shall, at the
written request of a grantee, relinquish the use of the channel to the grantee
in accordance with section 612 of the cable act (47 USC section 532(b)(4))
within sixty (60) calendar days of the receipt of such notice by the county.
   D.   Educational Access: An "educational access channel" is a channel
designated for noncommercial use by schools. In the event a grantee is
cablecasting educational access programming to subscribers in unincorporated
Kane County, the grantee shall continue to cablecast such programming
throughout the term of a franchise agreement or until such programming ceases.
   E.   Public Access: A "public access channel" is a channel designated for
noncommercial use by the residents of Kane County or by not for profit
organizations serving the residents of Kane County. In the event a grantee is
cablecasting public access programming to subscribers in unincorporated Kane
County, the grantee shall continue to cablecast such programming throughout the
term of a franchise agreement or until such programming ceases.
   F.   Government Access: A "government access channel" is a channel
designated for noncommercial use by the grantor.
   G.   Subscriber Survey: The county may, at any time, conduct a subscriber
survey to determine the cable related needs and interests of county residents
regarding the programming offered. The results of the survey may not be binding
upon the grantee, but shall serve as a reflection of the county's needs and
interests. A copy of such survey shall be made available to the grantee. (Ord.

10.5-120: REVOCATION PROCEDURE:
   A.   The franchise granted to a grantee pursuant to a franchise agreement is
subject to revocation in the event of any breach of a franchise agreement or
violation of this chapter. The following events, acts or omissions on the part
of the grantee are a substantial breach and may be considered cause for
revocation of the franchise and termination of a franchise agreement and
include, but are not limited to:
      1.   The grantee repeatedly violates any covenant, agreement, or
condition of its grant, and such violation shall not have been cured within
such reasonable period of time after written notice has been given by the
county authorities pursuant to the provisions of this article.
      2.   Material fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining a franchise.
      3.   Repeated failure to pay taxes, franchise fees, costs or penalties
when and as due the county after failure to respond after repeated notice and
opportunity to cure.
      4.   Failure to provide or maintain in full force and effect required
insurance coverage or required security instruments, including a surety bond or
a letter of credit, or to provide required indemnification to the county as
required by this chapter or a franchise agreement.
      5.   Failure to restore systemwide service in the franchise area after
seventy two (72) consecutive hours provided the grantee's failure to restore
systemwide service is not caused by circumstances or events beyond the
grantee's reasonable control.
      6.   Transfer of the franchise without county approval pursuant to
division 17, "Assignment Or Transfer", of this article.
      7.   Any order is entered in any proceeding against the grantee decreeing
the dissolution or split up of the grantee and such order remains in effect for
sixty (60) days or more.
      8.   The grantee fails to establish, construct, or operate a CATV system
substantially in compliance with the terms of a franchise agreement, with due
consideration given to the nature and cause of any delays.
      9.   The grantee abandons the franchise. The grantee shall be deemed to
have abandoned its franchise if it wilfully refuses or is unable to operate the
cable system as granted by a franchise agreement, when there is no event beyond
the grantee's control that prevents the operation of the CATV system, and where
operation would not endanger the health or safety of the public or property.
      10.   Any other material breach of this article or any violation of an
applicable franchise agreement.
   B.   "Repeated failure" shall mean failure of a material breach or violation
that occurs more than twice a calendar year.
   C.   In the event of a breach of a franchise agreement or violation of this
chapter, the county shall give written notice to the grantee setting forth:
      1.   The nature of the breach or violation by the grantee;
      2.   A written demand that the grantee correct the breach or violation;
      3.   Notice that any failure to correct the breach or violation within
thirty (30) days, or as the parties may agree in a franchise agreement, or by
other mutual agreement, may be cause for revocation of the franchise.
   D.   The grantee shall respond within thirty (30) days in writing to the
county after receipt of a notice of breach or violation and shall provide any
and all information and documentation in support of its response. The grantee's
response may include a statement:
      1.   That it contests the county's notice of breach or violation and
requests an opportunity to be heard as provided herein.
      2.   That corrective action has been implemented by the grantee and the
breach or violation has been cured.
      3.   That corrective action has been implemented by the grantee and is
being actively and diligently pursued, accompanied with a written corrective
action plan that includes the estimated time period in which the breach or
violation will be cured.
      4.   If requested by the grantee, or if the county is not satisfied that
sufficient corrective action is being actively and diligently pursued by the
grantee to remedy the breach or violation, the county shall schedule a public
hearing to hear and determine the issues and to consider whether sufficient
cause exists to revoke the franchise. The county shall give the grantee not
less than fourteen (14) days' written notice specifying the county's intent to
consider the revocation of the grantee's franchise, and the date, time and
place of the public hearing to be held before the county board or a hearing
officer appointed by the county board.
If a hearing officer has been designated, the hearing officer shall hear the
relevant evidence, preserve a record and submit written findings and a
recommendation to the county board for the board to make the appropriate
determination.
      5.   If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, the grantee shall
be entitled an opportunity to present to the county board a summary, orally or
in writing, of its position in response to the hearing officer's findings and
recommendations, but the grantee shall not have further opportunity to present
facts or evidence in support of its position. The county board shall receive
and consider the record and the hearing officer's findings and recommendations,
and shall consider the grantee's summary of its position, and shall determine
whether or not a breach or violation by the grantee has occurred, whether it
has been cured or a satisfactory corrective action plan has been submitted and
is being actively and diligently pursued and whether cause exists to initiate
revocation of the franchise or to impose some lesser sanction. The county board
may continue the hearing in order to allow the grantee to comply with any
lesser penalty imposed by the county board in order to correct any breaches or
violations.
In the event that the county board determines that cause exists to revoke the
franchise, it shall send notice of revocation within a reasonable time after
said determination.
      6.   If the county board determines that cause exists to revoke the
franchise, it may, by ordinance, declare a grantee's franchise to be terminated
and revoked consistent with applicable law, provided that the county may grant
a grantee an additional period of time to remedy the substantial breach or
violation before such ordinance becomes effective or grant a time period in
which the grantee may reinstate the revoked franchise.
      7.   No provision of this section shall be deemed to bar or otherwise
limit the right of the county to seek or obtain judicial relief to enforce the
provisions of this chapter or a franchise agreement.
      8.   In the event that a franchise has been revoked by the county and the
county acquires ownership of the CATV system, or effects a transfer of
ownership of a grantee's CATV system to another person, any such acquisition or
transfer shall be governed under section 627 of the cable act (47 USC section
547) or its successor provision.
      9.   Failure by a grantee to comply with a timetable for corrective
action as required by the county board pursuant to the requirements of this
section shall be considered to be a breach of this chapter and may result in a
cause for revocation of the franchise.
      10.   The county board may, upon good cause shown, and upon its own
motion, impose any lesser sanction permitted by this chapter, a franchise
agreement, or as such lesser sanction is permitted at law or in equity.
      11.   If the county board adopts an ordinance under this section which
terminates the franchise, grantee shall have all further legal remedies
available to it by law. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)

In the event of revocation of the franchise, expiration of the franchise, or
transfer of the franchise between the existing grantee and a successor grantee,
the existing grantee (prior to the revocation, transfer or expiration) shall
continue to provide cable service to its subscribers for a period of time until
a successor cable operator operates the cable system in the same manner and
with the same types of programming, customer service, and repair capabilities
and under the same terms and conditions as provided by a franchise agreement

10.5-122: REMOVAL:
   A.   Upon expiration or termination of a franchise, if the franchise is not
renewed, the cable operator is not using the cable for telecommunications
services as defined by the telecommunications act of 1996, and/or for
information services as defined by the telecommunications act of 1996, and if
neither the county nor an assignee purchases the CATV system, the grantee may
remove any underground cable from the rights of way which has been installed in
such a manner that it can be removed without trenching or other openings of the
rights of way along the extension of cable to be removed. The grantee shall not
remove any underground cable or conduit which requires trenching or other
opening of the rights of way along the extension of cable to be removed, except
as hereinafter provided.

the date of expiration or termination of the franchise. Underground cable and
conduit in the rights of way which is not so removed shall be deemed abandoned
and title thereto shall be vested in the county.
   E.   Upon expiration or termination of a franchise, if the franchise is not
renewed or transferred to a new owner or to the county, the grantee, at its
sole expense, shall, unless relieved of the obligation by the county, remove
from the rights of way all aboveground elements of the CATV system used
exclusively for video programming. The county shall not require the grantee to
remove any cabling, aboveground fixtures, or utility devices that provide
telecommunications services or information services as such are defined in the
telecommunications act of 1996; provided, however that a grantee shall
deactivate all portions of its plant and appurtenances that deliver cable
services if it is required to do so as a result of expiration or termination of
a franchise.
   F.   The grantee shall apply for and obtain such encroachment permits,
licenses, authorizations, or other approvals and pay such fees and deposit such
security as required by county division of transportation permit regulations
and access control regulations.
The grantee shall conduct and complete the work of removal in compliance with
the aforementioned permit and access control regulations, and shall restore the
rights of way to the same condition they were in before the work of removal
commenced. The work of removal shall be completed not later than one year
following the date of expiration or termination of the franchise; otherwise,
the county may complete such work and charge the expense thereof against the
security and/or surety bond required to be provided by the grantee. (Ord. 08-
252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)
10.5-123: MATERIAL VIOLATIONS:
   A.   In the event that the county determines that a grantee has violated any
material provision of the franchise, the county may make a written demand on
grantee that it remedy such violation and provide a period in which the
violation must be cured or remedied. If the violation is not cured or remedied,
or in the process of being cured or remedied to the satisfaction of the county,
within thirty (30) days following any such demand, the county shall determine
whether or not such violation by grantee was excusable or inexcusable as
follows:
      1.   The county shall conduct an administrative hearing to review the
alleged violation, and grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be
heard upon thirty (30) days' written notice to grantee of the time and the
place of the hearing; the allegations of franchise violations; and the remedy
sought by the county.
      2.   If, after notice is given and a hearing is held, the county
determines that such violation by grantee was excusable, the county shall
direct grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in
such manner and upon such terms and conditions as the county may reasonably
direct. If the county determines that such violation was inexcusable under a
like analysis, then it may impose a remedy in accordance with this chapter.
      3.   A hearing reviewing the administrative findings may be conducted by
a hearing officer appointed by the county board on the appeal of either the
county or the grantee. Such hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to
practice under the laws of the state of Illinois.
      4.   The cost of either hearing, if any, shall be borne by the ultimate
nonprevailing party. The costs incurred by the parties for attorney fees,
expert witness fees and other expenses shall be borne solely by the party
incurring the costs.
      5.   In any hearing conducted by a hearing officer, the officer shall,
upon conclusion of the hearing, prepare a recommended decision which includes
findings of fact and conclusions.
The recommended decision shall be filed with the county clerk and mailed to the
parties not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the
hearing. Upon receipt of such a recommended decision, the county board may,
without holding a further hearing, either:
         a.   Adopt the recommended decision, including findings of fact and
conclusions submitted by the hearing officer;
         b.   Adopt the findings of fact and conclusions contained in the
recommended decision, modify the decision, and adopt the recommended decision
as so revised;
         c.   Based upon the record of the hearing, modify the findings of
fact, conclusions or decisions, and adopt the recommended decision as so
revised; or
         d.   Reject the recommended decision and order that a new hearing be
held.
      6.   In the event that the county board determines that a remedy is
warranted, the county may impose a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per day per occurrence from the date upon which the violation or
violations were to have been cured. All fines levied are to be paid within
thirty (30) days and if not, such nonpayment after thirty (30) days could
constitute an additional breach or cause for revocation of the franchise. In
the event that there is a violation of customer service standards under the
provisions of section 10.5-80 of this chapter, the county may impose penalties
up to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each day of the material
breach, and shall not exceed twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) for each
occurrence of a material breach per customer. Monetary penalties pursuant to
this section shall apply on a competitively neutral basis to all providers of
cable service or video service within the county's jurisdiction and in no event
shall monetary penalties be assessed for a material breach if it is out of the
reasonable control of the cable or video providers or its affiliate. (Ord. 08-
252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)
10.5-124: ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES:
No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar the right of the county to
seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of the
franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated
thereunder.
Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this chapter nor the
exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the
county to recover, monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are
otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the grantee, or judicial
enforcement of the grantee's obligations by means of specific performance,
injunction relief or mandate, or any other judicial remedy available at law or
in equity. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)

rules and regulations, as updated and amended from time to time (47 CFR part
76, subpart K).
   B.   The grantee shall perform all tests necessary to determine compliance
with the FCC technical standards. Tests shall include, at minimum, proof of
performance tests required by FCC rule section 76.601 (47 CFR part 76.601) and
such additional or repeat tests involving specified subscriber terminals as may
be required to determine compliance with the FCC technical standards. Within
fifteen (15) days following a written request, the county shall have the right
to review the testing records required to be maintained by the grantee pursuant
to the FCC's rules.
   C.   Where there exists recurring evidence, which in the judgment of the
county, casts doubt upon the reliability or quality of cable service, the
county shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test,
analyze, and report on the performance of the cable system. The grantee shall
fully cooperate with the county in performing such testing and shall prepare
results, and a report, if requested, within thirty (30) days after notice. Such
report shall include the following information:
      1.   The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the special
tests;
      2.   The system component(s) tested;
      3.   The equipment used and procedures employed in testing;
      4.   The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem is resolved;
and
      5.   Any other information pertinent to the tests and analyses, which may
be required.
   D.   The county may require that an independent experienced professional
observe tests. A person shall be deemed an independent experienced professional
if he or she is not an employee of the county and has participated in similar
tests for other local franchising authorities or cable operators in the state
of Illinois. The professional shall be given records of any required tests and
shall forward to the county and grantee such records with a report interpreting
the results of the tests. The grantee shall conform to the FCC proof of
performance standards (47 USC section 76 subpart K). In the event that the
county should require that tests conducted by the grantee be supervised or
readministered, the county shall be responsible for the costs of an independent
experienced professional. In the event that the results of the test show that
the grantee is at fault, or that the grantee's tests were not conducted in
accordance with FCC technical standards, the grantee shall be responsible for
assuming the costs of the professional and the tests performed.
   E.   The county may, at a minimum, require tests, analyses, and reports
covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints concerning
CATV system performance tendered by the public, or other evidence when and
under such circumstances, the county has reasonable grounds to believe that
complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed in order to assure
that the CATV system is operating in compliance with FCC technical standards.
   F.   Not later than ninety (90) days after any new or substantially rebuilt
portion of a CATV system is made available for service to subscribers,
technical performance tests shall be conducted by the grantee to demonstrate
full compliance with FCC technical standards.
Such tests shall be performed by, or under the supervision of an engineer with
proper training and experience. A copy of the report shall be submitted to the
cable administrator describing test results, instrumentation, calibration, and
test procedure, and the qualifications of the engineer responsible for the
tests. In the event that the semiannual FCC proof of performance testing of the
CATV system occurs during the aforementioned ninety (90) day period, the proof
of performance test results from the new or substantially rebuilt portion of
the CATV system shall meet the requirements of this subsection. At the option
of the county, reasonable additional tests may be required, at the expense of
the grantee, if the grantee is unable to meet FCC technical standards based
upon the results of technical performance tests or proof of performance tests.
Any additional tests shall be conducted under the supervision of an engineer
with proper training and experience.
   G.   RF leakage shall be checked at locations for emergency radio services
in the longest feeder line or at trunk line extremities, not less than twice
per month, so as to prove no interference signal combinations are possible.
Radiation shall be measured adjacent to any proposed aeronautical navigation or
communication radio sites to prove that no interference to air navigational
reception is possible. Upon request, reports of grantee's cumulative leakage
index (CLI) performance data shall be filed with the Kane County development
department.
   H.   At any time after commencement of service of subscribers, the county
may require additional reasonable tests, including full or partial repeat tests
complying with the procedures of 47 CFR section 76, subpart K, involving a
subscriber's terminal, at the grantee's expense to the extent that such tests
may be performed by the grantee's employees using existing facilities and
equipment; provided, however, that the county reserves the right to conduct its
own tests upon reasonable notice to a grantee and if noncompliance is found,
the expense thereof shall be borne by the grantee. The county shall endeavor to
arrange its request for such special tests so as to minimize hardship or
inconvenience to the grantee or to the subscriber.
   I.   If the FCC should delete the requirements of 47 CFR section 76, subpart
K, the county hereby reserves the right to amend this article and any franchise
agreement to incorporate similar standards, and every franchise granted
pursuant to this article shall be subject to such reserved power whether or not
expressly so conditioned.
   J.   Pursuant to 220 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/21-1001(a), the foregoing
conditions of subsections A through I of this section shall apply to a holder

notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof, as estimated by the county
based upon prior payments by the surety.

surety bond, the county may, after providing grantee thirty (30) days' notice
of intent to do so, call upon the surety not more than five (5) days before
such expiration date.
   E.   The county shall give the grantee written notice of any payment from
the surety under this section, specifying the amount and the specific reason
for such payment. Within thirty (30) days following receipt by the grantee of
written notice from the county that any amount has been paid out by the surety,
the grantee shall restore such surety bond to the amount required under the
agreement. Failure by the grantee to restore the surety bond shall be
considered a material violation of this chapter.
   F.   The rights reserved by the county with respect to the surety bond are
in addition to all other rights of the county whether reserved by this chapter
or authorized by law or equity, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a
right with respect to surety bond shall constitute a waiver of any other right
the county may have. (Ord. 08-252, 8-12-2008, eff. 9-1-2008)

within twenty four (24) months of the effective date of the franchise agreement
or as may be otherwise provided in the franchise agreement.
   B.   Failure to complete construction within the time frames set forth
herein shall constitute a breach of the terms of any franchise agreement.
However, in locations in which the density of residential dwelling units,
adverse terrain, or other factors render construction of the system and the
offering of services impracticable or technically unfeasible, or create an
undue economic burden, the Kane County development department may, upon the
written request of the grantee, either waive the construction of the system
into such areas, or allow the construction and offer of service on such special
terms, conditions, and provisions as are reasonable and fair to the county, the
grantee, and the potential subscribers in such areas.

available when it is offered on a nondiscriminatory basis for immediate usage
to the owner, or representative of the owner empowered to consent to use, of
the property of each home within the franchise area.
   C.   For the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of this
article and of determining completion under this section, the total number of
dwelling units within each franchise area shall be deemed to be the actual
number of units available for occupancy as of a date forty five (45) calendar
days in advance of the date of filing by the grantee of the notice of
completion; provided that the grantee files the notice of completion with a
good faith belief that it has in fact achieved completion as of the date of
filing.

(60) day period following filing of the notice of completion, all elements and
components thereof, and all equipment and studio facilities required by the
franchise agreement shall be subject to inspection by county employees or
authorized agents or representatives thereof, for the purpose of determining
whether the system and related facilities comply with the franchise agreement
and the provisions of this article. The grantee shall authorize such inspection
and provide such information and cooperation as is required in order to permit
an adequate investigation to determine the existence or nonexistence of such
compliance.

or mortgaged, either in whole or in part, disposed of, transferred in trust,
pledged in whole or in part, by voluntary sale, merger, sale and leaseback
consolidation or otherwise, or by forced or involuntary sale, nor shall title
thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right or interest therein, pass to
or vest in any party without the prior written consent of the county expressed
by ordinance and then on such conditions as therein may be prescribed. Any
sale, transfer, or assignment not made according to the procedures set forth in
this chapter shall render the franchise agreement void.
The sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of the major part of the tangible
assets of a grantee shall be considered an assignment and shall be subject to
the provisions of this section.
   B.   In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the county will not
approve any such transfer of control or ownership prior to substantial
completion of construction or reconstruction of the CATV system.
Notwithstanding the foregoing a grantee may transfer ownership or control of
the franchise or the CATV system, after notice to the county, to an entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with grantee, where such
transfer does not result in a change in the management, operation or ultimate
controlling entity of the franchise or the system without any release of the
liability of the grantee. The recipient of a transferred franchise for said
system shall not be subject to the requirements for new franchises, nor shall
the recipient be considered a new franchise for any other purpose provided by
law, provided that the transferee agrees in writing to abide by all of the
terms and conditions of the franchise agreement with the transferor. In no
event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the
successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement agreeing in writing to
comply with the terms, obligations, and conditions of the franchise agreement
for the remainder of the franchise term. The grantee as transferor, shall
promptly cure any present or ongoing franchise violations or defaults prior to
the county's granting of consent for the transfer of control or ownership of
the franchise.
   C.   Whenever any transfer subject to county approval under subsection A of
this section is proposed, a grantee and any proposed assignee or transferee of
the franchise shall submit an FCC form 394, or its successor at least one
hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer containing or
accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with applicable
law and FCC regulations. In addition, the grantee and/or the transferee shall
provide any and all information and documentation of the legal, financial,
managerial, technical, and character qualifications of the prospective
transferee or controlling party to operate and maintain the cable system. The
grantee and the prospective transferee or controlling party shall provide all
other reasonable information as allowed under applicable law requested by the
county in connection with such inquiry within the time frames established by
the FCC, and that addresses the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment
upon the public.
   D.   Prior approval of the county shall be required where ownership or
control of more than twenty five percent (25%), or such other percentage as may
be agreed to in a franchise agreement, of the right of control of a grantee
acquired, is transferred or during the term of the franchise in any transaction
or series of transactions by a person or group of persons acting individually
or collectively, on the effective date of the franchise agreement. The word
"control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but also includes
actual working control in whatever manner exercised. By its acceptance of the
franchise agreement, a grantee specifically acknowledges and agrees that any
such acquisition occurring without a prior approval of the county shall render
the franchise void.
   E.   Subject to any limitations set forth in the franchise agreement, any
transfer of the grantee's cable system, or any part thereof, subject to the
county's right of approval pursuant to subsection A of this section shall also
be subject to the county's right to elect to acquire the grantee's cable
system, or the part thereof proposed to be transferred, for the consideration
specified in a bona fide purchase offer based upon valuations from a qualified
firm specializing in cable system appraisals acceptable to the grantee. The
county shall exercise this right by written notice to a grantee within thirty
(30) days following its receipt of the notice required in subsection B of this
section. Except for the consideration, the county shall be obligated in
exercising this right to accept all other terms of the proposed transfer. The
county's rights hereunder shall in no way affect its independent rights under
any other provision of this chapter or under the franchise agreement.
   F.   The county shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer if
the county fails to render a final decision on the request for approval of the
proposed transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days following the county's
receipt of the completed written application containing such information as
required in subsection C of this section, unless the county and the applicant
agree in writing to extend the time for the county to review the application
and to grant or deny its consent. The consent of the county for the extension
of time shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   G.   Any transfer approved by the county shall be made by a document

   A.   It is the purpose of this division to provide a source of revenue to
implement the solid waste management fund for Kane County as authorized by
public act 85-14. The fund will be used for solid waste management purposes,
including long term monitoring and maintenance of landfills, planning,
inspection, enforcement and all other activities consistent with the solid
waste management act of Illinois and the authorized uses of the county landfill
enterprise fund.
   B.   It is the purpose of the county board in establishing the county solid
waste disposal fee to administer said fee equitably and in a manner that will
not create economic hardship. It is the county board's intention that the fee
established hereby, although imposed on the landfill owners or operators, shall
ultimately be borne by the generators of waste being disposed of within Kane
County. (Ord. 08-168, 5-13-2008)
11-22: SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FEE:
   A.   On or after August 1, 1988, the county shall assess and collect a fee
in the amount set forth herein from the owner or operator of each sanitary
landfill located within the county which is permitted or required to be
permitted by the Illinois EPA to dispose of solid waste, if the sanitary
landfill is located off the site where such waste was produced and if such
sanitary landfill is owned, controlled, and operated by a person other than the
generator of such waste.
   B.   The owner or operator of any sanitary landfill subject to this section
shall pay a fee of sixty cents ($0.60) per cubic yard of nonhazardous solid
waste received at a site, unless the owner or operator weighs the quantity of
the solid waste received with a device for which certification has been
obtained under the weights and measures act, in which case, the fee shall not
exceed one dollar twenty seven cents ($1.27) per ton of solid waste received.
   C.   The amount of said fee shall be determined by the quantities of solid
waste reported as received on the solid waste disposal report required by this
division.
   D.   Payment of the solid waste disposal fee shall be made on a quarterly
basis in conjunction with the solid waste disposal report required by this
division. Payment shall be in the form of a check payable to the treasurer of
Kane County, Illinois, and shall be deposited in the previously established
enterprise surcharge fund. (Ord. 08-168, 5-13-2008)
11-23: EXEMPTIONS FROM FEE:
   A.   The county shall grant exemptions from the fee requirements of this
division for receipt or transport of solid waste meeting all of the following
criteria:
      1.   Receipt of solid waste is pursuant to a written contract between the
owner or operator of the sanitary landfill and some other person, or transport
of the solid waste is pursuant to a written contract between the transporter
and some other person; and
      2.   The contract for receipt or transport of solid waste was lawfully
executed on or before August 1, 1988, and has not been amended at any time
after that date, and by its express terms continues beyond August 2, 1988; and
      3.   The contract for receipt or transport of solid waste established a
fixed fee for compensation, and by its express terms or by implication does not
allow the operator or transporter to pass the fee through to another party, and
does not allow voluntary cancellation or renegotiation of the compensation or
fee during the terms of the contract.
   B.   Exemptions granted under this section shall cause the solid waste
received by an owner or operator of a sanitary landfill to be disregarded in
calculating the volume or weight of solid waste received during a calendar year
under this division.
   C.   Applications for exemptions under this section may be granted
retroactively. Applications for retroactive or prospective exemptions must be
submitted with proof of satisfaction of all criteria necessary to grant the
exemption, and must be received by the county before October 1, 1988.
   D.   It shall be the duty of an owner or operator of a sanitary landfill to
keep accurate records and to prove to the satisfaction of the county the volume
or weight of solid waste received under an exemption during the calendar year.
   E.   Exemptions under this section shall expire upon the expiration, renewal
or amendment of the exempted control, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 08-168, 5-
13-2008)
11-24: SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL REPORT:
   A.   Every owner or operator of a sanitary landfill located within the
county which is permitted, or required to be permitted by the Illinois EPA,
shall file quarterly reports specifying the quantities of waste received and
the fee payment due to the county.
   B.   Said report shall be on the form provided by the county.
   C.   The quarterly solid waste disposal report shall be due on January 15,
April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each calendar year. (Ord. 08-168, 5-13-
2008)
11-25: TERMINATION:
Any owner or operator of a sanitary landfill subject to the provisions of this
division intending to terminate the receipt of solid waste during the calendar
year shall notify the county of such intent. Unless termination of operation is
the result of an emergency order by a regulatory agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction, the owner or operator of a sanitary landfill must notify the
county ninety (90) days in advance of any termination of operation. Such notice
must include the estimated date upon which the landfill will no longer receive
solid waste for disposal. (Ord. 08-168, 5-13-2008)
11-26: APPEALS:
   A.   Any person disputing the payment of the solid waste disposal fee
established by this division may file a protest along with his payment and
request a hearing.
   B.   A hearing shall, thereafter, be provided by the county within sixty
(60) days of said filing. (Ord. 08-168, 5-13-2008)
11-27: EFFECTIVE DATE:
The solid waste disposal fee established by this division shall become
effective on August 1, 1988. The first quarterly solid waste disposal report
shall be due, together with a fee based on that report, on October 15, 1988.

the date the petition was filed if the applicant filed an amendment to the
petition in compliance with the timing requirements of the act, the county
board shall, by written resolution, upon the vote of a majority of its members,
decide whether to:
      1.   Grant the petition, without any conditions; or
      2.   Grant the petition, but with conditions on such approval, provided
such conditions are reasonable and necessary to accomplish the purposes of
section 39.2 of the act and are not inconsistent with the regulations
promulgated by the Illinois pollution control board; or
      3.   Deny the petition.
   B.   The county board shall state in its decision its findings as to whether
the applicant has established, and whether the public record supports the
establishment of each of the following criteria:
      1.   The facility is necessary to accommodate the waste needs of the area
it is intended to serve;
      2.   The facility is so designed, located and proposed to be operated
that the public health, safety and welfare will be protected;
      3.   The facility is located so as to minimize the incompatibility with
the character of the surrounding area and to minimize the effect on the value
of the surrounding property;
      4.   For a facility other than a sanitary landfill or waste disposal
site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the 100-year floodplain
or the site is floodproofed; and for a facility that is a sanitary landfill or
waste disposal site, the facility is located outside the boundary of the 100-
year floodplain, or if the facility is a facility described in subsection (b)
(3) of section 22.19a of the act, the site is floodproofed;
      5.   The plan of operations for the facility is designed to minimize the
danger to the surrounding area from fire, spills, or other operational
accidents;
      6.   The traffic patterns to or from the facility are so designed as to
minimize the impact on existing traffic flows;
      7.   If the facility will be treating, storing or disposing of hazardous
waste, an emergency response plan exists for the facility which includes
notification, containment and evacuation procedures to be used in case of an
accidental release;
      8.   If the facility is to be located in a county where the county board
has adopted a solid waste management plan consistent with the planning
requirements of the local solid waste disposal act or the solid waste planning
and recycling act, the facility is consistent with that plan; for purposes of
this criterion (8), the “solid waste management plan” means the plan that is in
effect as of the date the application for siting approval is filed; and
      9.   If the facility is located in a regulated recharge area, any
applicable requirements specified by the Illinois pollution control board for
such areas have been met.
   C.   The county board shall consider as evidence the previous operating
experience and past record of convictions or admissions of violations of the
applicant (and any subsidiary, parent corporation, or subsidiary of the parent
corporation) in the field of solid waste management when considering the second
and fifth criterion of the act, and subsections B2 and B5 of this section.
   D.   In making its decision, the county board shall consider the public
record of the hearing proceedings, as defined in section
11-64 of this chapter, except that the county board shall not consider as
evidence those portions of the public record identified in subsections
11-64A3 and
11-64A8 through A10 of this chapter. The county board shall give greater
evidentiary weight to sworn testimony and evidence presented during the public
hearings than to unsworn oral or written comment.
   E.   No determination by the county board of a petition may be reconsidered,
except to the extent it is reversed and remanded on appeal and the county board
is directed by the Illinois pollution control board or Illinois appellate court
to conduct all or part of the review process again.
   F.   Any county board member may be excused from participation in the
hearing and decision upon demonstration of any disqualifying direct and
personal interest in the property or the affairs of the applicants.
Additionally, any county board member may abstain from voting on the decision,
except to the extent there are insufficient number of board members to pass a
resolution consistent with subsection A of this section. (Ord. 04-393, 10-12-
2004; Ord. 08-168, 5-13-2008; Ord. 21-183, 4-13-2021)

legislative capacity for the purpose of regulating the conduct of appearing
nude in public places that, considering what has happened in other communities,
the acts prohibited in section
14.5-5 of this chapter, encourage or create the potential for criminal
activity, that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct, begets and has
the potential for begetting undesirable and unlawful behavior; that sexual,
lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among patrons and employees within

purpose of obtaining money or other financial gain for such person or for
another person or entity; or
   B.   When the conduct of being nude cannot legally be prohibited by this
chapter: 1) because it constitutes a part of a bona fide live communication,

conduct incidental to and necessary for the conveyance or communication of a
genuine message or public expression and is not a mere guise or pretense
utilized to exploit the conduct of being nude for profit or commercial gain and
as such is protected by the United States or Illinois constitution; or 2)
because it is otherwise protected by the United States or Illinois
constitution. (Ord. 96-313, 11-12-1996)

Any person or entity violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
prosecuted in the same manner as other ordinance violations are prosecuted.

The post office designation or address established by federal authorities for
the delivery of rural mail may be used in connection with rural house numbering
and road names. The development director shall be the administrator of this
article. (Res., §§ 13, 14, 12-12-1962)
16-17: ADOPTION; PURPOSES:
   A.   There is hereby established for this county a system of section line
markers or mile posts to be placed along the numbered highway routes and other
main roads and streets throughout the county so that motor vehicle operators
may better determine their general location and destination, and a system of
rural house numbering, based on the section line markers, requiring each owner
of property located in the unincorporated parts of the county to place an
identifying number on his residence, business or other main building and at the
driveway leading thereto from the public road.
   B.   It is the purpose of the section line markers and house numbers:
      1.   To facilitate the rendering of fire and police protection and
assistance and the giving of medical aid in case of accident or other need,
thus promoting the public health, safety and general welfare of the users of
the highways and citizens of the county;
      2.   To expedite the delivery of merchandise, fuel and mail and the
servicing and repair of farm, business and home utilities and equipment; and
      3.   To make possible the gradual development of more efficient methods
of keeping business and public records relating to rural property, residents
and business. (Res., 12-12-1962, § 1)
16-18: LOCATION MARKERS ALONG HIGHWAYS:
   A.   To provide a countywide system of reference for marking locations along
highways, roads and streets and for numbering houses in the rural areas, all
section lines established by government land surveys shall be designated as
follows:
      1.   The east and west section line that forms the south boundary of
sections 7 to 12 in the townships of Kaneville, Blackberry and Geneva shall be
a zero baseline.
         a.   To the north of the zero baseline, all parallel section lines
shall be numbered successively, the first one designated 1N, the second one 2N
and so on to the north boundary of the county, which shall be 20N.
         b.   To the south of the zero baseline, all parallel section lines
shall be numbered successively, the first one designated 1S, the second one 2S
and so on to the south boundary of the county, which shall be 10S.
      2.   The north and south section line that forms the east boundary of
Dundee Township shall be designated 32W. The first parallel section line to the
west thereof and the section line that forms the east boundary of the townships
of Elgin, St. Charles, Geneva, Batavia and Aurora shall be designated 33W. The
next parallel section line to the west thereof shall be 34W, the next 35W and
so on to the west boundary of the county which shall be 51W.
   B.   Wherever a north and south principal highway, road or street intersects
an east and west section line, there may be erected on each side of the roadway
a section line marker or milepost displaying the proper "N" or "S" section line
designation. Similarly on east and west highways at intersections with north
and south section lines, the proper "W" location marker or milepost may be
erected on each side of the roadway. Diagonal and curved highways or major
sections thereof shall be determined by the administrator to be either north
and south or east and west depending on whether the general direction is more
nearly one or the other and whether logical continuity is maintained. Markers
may be placed between section lines at important highway intersections showing
the decimal distance beyond the section line.
   C.   The wording on each section line marker may take the general form of
"MILE 5N", the word "MILE" usually being placed above the number in smaller
sized letters. The administrator shall determine after consultation with
representatives of the several highway jurisdictions in the county any other
features and standards of design and placement.
   D.   The jurisdiction having responsibility for the maintenance of the
various highways, roads and streets in the county may erect location markers on
their respective roads as soon as practicable and shall maintain them as a part
of the roadway improvement. As the system becomes established, map makers shall
be urged to show and explain the system of location markers on new editions of
maps. (Res., 12-12-1962, §§ 2-5)
16-19: RURAL HOUSE NUMBERING:
   A.   In the unincorporated parts of the county the following rules shall
govern the house numbers to be used on the principal buildings, driveways and
potential land divisions:
      1.   999 house numbers shall be available for assignment and use within
each section of land or mile.
      2.   Diagonal and curved highways shall be classified as to direction as
set forth in this article.
      3.   Odd numbers shall be used on the south, east and southeast sides of
highways and shall range across each section from 001 to not over 999.
      4.   Even numbers shall be used on the north, west and northwest sides of
highways and shall range across each section from 002 to not over 998.
      5.   To the north of the zero baseline described above in this article,
house numbering on the north and south highways shall run from south to north;
to the south of the zero baseline, house numbering shall run from north to
south.
      6.   At the half section line numbering shall begin with 501 and 502.
      7.   The house number for all other points shall be apportioned by the
administrator according to distances measured at right angles from the section
lines and half section lines, making such variations as may be necessary in the
case of irregular or fractional sections.
      8.   The complete number to be used in writing or giving an address shall
be formed by combining the section line designation, as established in this
article, and the house number, as illustrated in the following examples:
         5N-502 Dunham Road
         37W-501 Campana Road
   B.   When notified by notice published in the newspapers of the county,
owners or occupants of buildings in the unincorporated parts of the county may
furnish, erect and maintain the house number identifying their properties.
Numerals shall be at least four inches (4") high and be mounted on the main
building in a manner visible from the highway. If the building setback is
greater than one hundred feet (100') from the center of the road, an additional
number shall be placed at or near the driveway entrance in a location visible
from both directions along the highway. The house number may be also displayed
on each highway mailbox. The number on a mailbox which adjoins a driveway
entrance shall be considered as also marking the entrance.
   C.   Where the administrator hereof finds that a small unincorporated area
is wholly or partly surrounded by, or is closely related to, one or more
municipalities and would be best served by the use of adjoining municipal house
numbering, an exception from the use of the rural house number may be granted.
(Res., 12-12-1962, §§ 6, 7, 9)
16-20: ROAD NAMES:
   A.   Existing names and number designations for highways, roads and streets
in the unincorporated parts of the county which the administrator hereof finds
are generally recognized and established by use on current maps and signs shall
be used in connection with rural house numbering unless changed by appropriate
action of the county board.
   B.   The development department shall determine and report to the county
board existing and potential cases of conflicting or confusing names of
highways, roads and streets located in the same or nearby postal service areas
along with recommendations for appropriate changes.
   C.   In order to avoid names which conflict, are similar, or are otherwise
not consistent with good principles of street naming, street names proposed to
be shown on subdivision plats shall be checked with the development department
in advance of completion of the final plat. (Res., 12-12-1962, §§ 10-12)
16-21: USE BY PUBLIC OFFICIALS:
Wherever practicable, section line designations and rural house numbers along
with highway names or numbers may be used in the operation of and records kept
by the county development department, county regional planning commission,
county highway department, assessor, sheriff, state police, state division of
highways, local fire protection districts, townships, civilian defense
officials and other agencies operating in the county. (Res., 12-12-1962, § 8)
16-22: EFFECT UPON MUNICIPALITIES:
This article shall provide an official system of house numbering which may be
adopted by any municipal corporation within the county at the discretion of the
authorities of such corporation. The adoption of this article by the county
board does not imply that the regulations herein contained will be imposed upon
any municipal corporation, but shall be considered permissive authority to
guide the establishment of such a system by those municipal corporations
desiring to use same. (Res., 12-12-1962, § 15)

certificate of appropriateness. (Ord. 88-99, 6-14-1988, eff. 12-1-1988; Ord.
00-186, 7-11-2000)
16-94: CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS:
   A.   Certificate Required: A certificate of appropriateness from the
preservation commission established pursuant to this article shall be required
before any significant alteration, construction, demolition or removal that
affects pending or designated landmarks, preservation districts and road
corridors is undertaken. Such a certificate is required for all such actions
from the date a nomination in proper form for designation is submitted to the
preservation commission.
   B.   Applications For Certificate Of Appropriateness:
      1.   Every application submitted to the county development department,
the county division of transportation or other county department for a permit
wherein the applicant represents and/or delineates plans to commence any action
as immediately described in subsection A of this section affecting any such
property, improvements or areas therein described shall be forwarded to a
representative or representatives of the preservation commission, within three
(3) days following the receipt of said application. The county development
department, county division of transportation or other county department shall
not issue the permit until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by
the preservation commission. Any applicant may request a meeting with the
preservation commission before the application is sent to the preservation
commission or during the review of the application.
      2.   Application for review of construction, alteration, demolition or
removal not requiring a permit for which a certificate of appropriateness is
required shall be made on a form prepared by the preservation commission and
available at the office of the county development department. The preservation
commission may schedule, provide notice and conduct a public hearing concerning
the application in the manner previously described in sections 16-78 and 16-79
of this chapter.
      3.   If a public hearing is not scheduled the commission may consider the
completed application at its next regular meeting and may grant a certificate
of appropriateness at that time. The commission may further designate staff
support responsible for reviewing routing applications for certificates of
appropriateness when the proposed work is clearly appropriate and in accordance
with the criteria set forth in subsections C and D of this section, and the
purposes of this article.
      4.   The commission may seek technical advice from outside its members on
any application for a certificate of appropriateness. The applicant and each
commissioner shall receive a copy of the consultant's written opinion at least
seven (7) days before a determination is made on the application.
      5.   The commission shall act promptly and in a reasonable manner in its
judgment of plans for new construction or for alteration, removal or demolition
of structures in preservation districts or road corridors that have little
historic value and that are not shown on priority lists, except where such
construction, alteration, removal or demolition would seriously impair the
historic, architectural or scenic value of surrounding structures or the
surrounding area.
   C.   Design Criteria: The commission shall consider the following factors in
reviewing applications for certificates of appropriateness:
      1.   Height: The height of any proposed alteration or construction should
be compatible with the style and character of the landmark and with surrounding
structures in a preservation district or road corridor.
      2.   Proportions Of Windows And Doors: The proportions and relationships
between doors and windows should be compatible with the architectural style and
character of the landmark and with surrounding structures within a preservation
district or road corridor.
      3.   Relationship Of Building Masses And Spaces: The relationship of a
structure within a preservation district or road corridor to open space between
it and adjoining structures should be compatible.
      4.   Roof Shape: The design of the roof should be compatible with the
architectural style and character of the landmark and surrounding structures in
a preservation district or road corridor.
      5.   Landscaping: Landscaping should be compatible with the architectural
character and appearance of the landmark and of surrounding structures and
landscapes in preservation districts or road corridors.
      6.   Scale: The scale of the structure after alteration, construction, or
partial demolition should be compatible with its architectural style and
character and with surrounding structures in a preservation district or road
corridor.
      7.   Directional Expression: Facades in preservation districts or road
corridors should blend with other structures with regard to directional
expression. Structures in a preservation district or road corridor should be
compatible with the dominant horizontal or vertical expression of surrounding
structures. The directional expression of a landmark after alteration,
construction or partial demolition should be compatible with its original
architectural style and character.
      8.   Architectural Details: Architectural details including materials,
and textures should be treated so as to make a landmark compatible with its
original architectural style or character.
   D.   Standards For Review: The commission, in considering the
appropriateness of any alteration, demolition, new construction, or removal of
any property or structures designated, or pending designation as a landmark or
any area designated, or pending designation as a preservation district or road
corridor, shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to the
corridor management plan or any design criteria in the ordinance designating
the landmark, preservation district or road corridor, as well as conformance to
applicable zoning classification, height and area limitation:
      1.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      2.   The distinguished original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or natural
feature should be avoided when possible.
      3.   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      4.   Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
      5.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
      6.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      7.   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      8.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
      9.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, cultural or natural material and
such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character
of the property, neighborhood or environment.
      10.   In the case of a road corridor, every reasonable effort shall be
made to protect and preserve the visible features and structures identified in
the corridor management plan for a designated road corridor or in the
nomination and draft corridor management plan, if applicable, for a nominated
road corridor.
   E.   Determination By Preservation Commission:
      1.   Within fifteen (15) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays
excluded) after support staff review, or from the date of the regular meeting,
or from the close of a public hearing concerning an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, or within such further time as the applicant
for said certificate (and/or permit) approves in writing, the commission shall
determine whether: a) the proposed construction, alteration, demolition,
removal or other modification will be appropriate to the preservation of the
particular landmark, preservation district or road corridor and a certificate
of appropriateness may be issued; or b) such proposed modification is
inappropriate to the preservation of the particular landmark, preservation
district or road corridor and a certificate of appropriateness may be denied.
      2.   Written notice of the approval or denial of the application for a
certificate of appropriateness shall be provided to the applicant, sent by
certified mail with return receipt requested, and to the county development
department within seven (7) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays
excluded) following the determination and shall be accompanied by a certificate
of appropriateness in the case of an approval.
   F.   Denial Of Certificate Of Appropriateness: A denial of a certificate of
appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the
denial. The preservation commission shall make recommendations to the applicant
concerning changes, if any, in the proposed action that would cause the
preservation commission to reconsider its denial and shall confer with the
applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the difference(s)
between the applicant and the commission. The applicant may resubmit an amended
application or reapply for a permit that takes into consideration the
recommendations of the preservation commission.
   G.   Decision Binding On Director, County Development Department, And County
Engineer: The director of the county development department and the county
engineer, shall be bound by the determination of the commission and approve, if
in conformance with other provisions of the building code, or disapprove any
permit application for the proposed construction, alteration, or removal of an
exterior architectural or visual feature, or demolition of any building or
structure, in a preservation district or road corridor or any landmark in
accordance with said determination.
   H.   Failure Of Commission To Review Application In A Timely Manner: Failure
of the commission to act upon an application for a certificate of
appropriateness within ninety (90) days shall constitute approval and no other
evidence shall be needed. This time limit may be waived only by mutual consent
of the applicant and the commission.
   I.   Demolitions:
      1.   Pursuant to subsections C and D of this section, the preservation
commission may deny any application for a certificate of appropriateness where
demolition is proposed upon finding that such proposed action will adversely
affect the historic, archaeological, architectural or scenic significance of a
landmark, preservation district or road corridor. Upon receipt of an
application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the
preservation commission shall as soon as possible make a determination,
supported by written findings, whether one or more of the following criteria
are met:
         a.   The structure or visual resource is of such interest or quality
that it would reasonably meet national, state or local criteria for designation
as a historic or architectural landmark.
         b.   The structure or visual resource is of such unusual or uncommon
design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced, or be reproduced
only with great difficulty and expense.
         c.   Retention of the structure or visual resource would aid
substantially in preserving and protecting another structure or visual resource
which meets the criteria of subsection I1a or I1b of this section.
Where the preservation commission determines that one or more of these criteria
are met, no certificate of appropriateness shall be issued and the application
shall be denied.
      2.   Additionally, the preservation commission shall require the
applicant to submit for review, and consideration postdemolition plans, to
include drawings or sketches with sufficient detail to show, as far as they
relate to exterior appearance, the architectural design of any and all
improvements incorporated in such plans.
   J.   Compliance With Certificate: A certificate of appropriateness will
become void:
      1.   If there is any change in the scope of work pursuant to the approved
application subsequent to the issuance of the certificate; or
      2.   If twenty four (24) months have elapsed after issuance of the
certificate and no permit has been issued or if twenty four (24) months have
lapsed after issuance of the last permit and the project has not been
completed.
   K.   Appeals: A denial of a certificate of appropriateness is an
"administrative decision" as defined in 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101
of the administrative review law, and it shall be subject to judicial review
pursuant to provisions of said administrative review law and all amendments and
modifications thereof, and the rules adopted thereto. (Ord. 88-99, 6-14-1988,
eff. 12-1-1988; Ord. 00-186, 7-11-2000)
16-95: ECONOMIC HARDSHIP:
   A.   Issuance: The preservation commission shall issue a certificate of
economic hardship upon determination that the failure to issue a certificate of
appropriateness has denied, or will deny, the owner of a landmark or of a
property within a preservation district or road corridor all reasonable use of,
or return on, the property. Application for a certificate of economic hardship
shall be made on a form and in the manner as prescribed by the preservation
commission. The preservation commission may schedule a public hearing
concerning the application and provide notice in the same manner as prescribed
in section
16-79 of this chapter.
   B.   Expert Testimony: The preservation commission may solicit expert
testimony and the applicant for a certificate of economic hardship may submit
any or all of the following information in order to assist the preservation
commission in its determination on the application, including, but not limited
to:
      1.   An estimate of the cost of the proposed construction, alteration,
demolition or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be
incurred to comply with the recommendations of the preservation commission for
changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness;
      2.   A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any structures on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation;
      3.   Estimated market value of the property in its current condition;
after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition or
removal; after any changes recommended by the preservation commission; and in
the case of a proposed demolition, after renovation of the existing property
for continued use;
      4.   In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect,
developer, real estate consultant, appraiser or other real estate professional
experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation
or reuse of the existing structure on the property;
      5.   Amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the party
from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property
was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer;
      6.   If the property is income producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two (2) years; itemized operating and maintenance
expenses for the previous two (2) years; and depreciation deduction and annual
cash flow before and after debt services, if any, during the same period;
      7.   Remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the
property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two (2) years;
      8.   Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked and offers
received, if any, within the previous two (2) years;

This chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the "Kane County Road
Improvement Impact Fee Ordinance", hereinafter the “chapter.” (Ord. 22-27, 1-
11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-9: PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY:
   A.   The County Board recognizes that new development in Kane County
requires the capacity of the County highway system be expanded and that without
a funded program for County highway system improvements, new development will
have an adverse impact on the safety and efficiency of the County highway
system.
   B.   The County Board further recognizes that all new development in Kane
County generates traffic on the County highway system and requires direct or
indirect access to those highways that are a part of the County highway system,
regardless of the location of the new development.
   C.   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that new development pays a
fair share of the cost of County highway improvements expended to serve new
development. To that end, the imposition of impact fees is designed to
supplement other funding sources so that the burden of paying for County
highway improvements necessitated by new development is allocated in a fair and
equitable manner and orderly growth is promoted throughout Kane County. (Ord.
22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)

17-11: INTERPRETATION OF ORDINANCE, FEE SCHEDULE AND APPEALS:
   A.   Application of the provisions of this chapter, the impact fee
schedules, standard individual assessment, and simplified individual assessment
shall be made by the County Engineer. Whenever necessary, the County Engineer
may use the latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip
Generation Manual, the latest edition of the Transportation Research Board
Highway Capacity Manual, or locally obtained empirical data, in applying this
chapter. The County Engineer shall establish a Procedures Manual identifying
the procedures the Division of Transportation will utilize in administering
this chapter.
   B.   Any decision by the County Engineer with respect to this chapter may be
appealed by the fee payer to the County Board through its Transportation
Committee. Any appeal shall be made by written petition within fourteen (14)
calendar days of written notice of a decision by the County Engineer.
   C.   Upon receipt of a petition for appeal of a decision of the County
Engineer, the Transportation Committee shall schedule consideration of such
appeal at its next regularly scheduled committee meeting that will comply with
the requirements of the Illinois Open Meetings Act, (5 ILCS 120/1 et seq.). The
Transportation Committee shall notify the petitioner in writing of the date and

subsequent relief in a de novo proceeding in the Circuit Court of the Sixteenth
Judicial Circuit, Kane County, Illinois. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-
478, 12-13-2022)
17-12: DEVELOPERS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT TO PAY ROAD IMPROVEMENT IMPACT FEE:
Any developer initiating or conducting new development shall pay an impact fee
to the County in accordance with the terms and conditions of this chapter.
(Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-13: INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS:
At any time after the adoption of this chapter, the County may enter into an
intergovernmental agreement with any municipality the boundaries of which are
within Kane County regarding the impact fee imposed by this chapter. Such
intergovernmental agreements shall be adopted in accordance with law and may
include provisions governing administrative issues involving the collection of
the impact fee assessed and any other matters deemed necessary or appropriate
by the County and the municipality. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478,
12-13-2022)
17-14: ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT FEES AND IMPACT FEE SCHEDULE:
   A.   An impact fee assessment shall be calculated pursuant to the impact fee
schedules set forth in Exhibit B of Ord. 22-7, and Ord. 22-478, and shall be
due upon issuance of a building permit, unless otherwise provided for herein.
Unless the project is otherwise covered by an impact fee agreement, impact fees
shall be assessed based on the predominant use of each building.
   B.   Any new development shall be assessed an impact fee under the terms of
the Ordinance in effect at the time of site specific development approval. For
any new development, the assessed impact fee shall not be greater than the
impact fee calculated under the most current version of this chapter and its
attached impact fee schedules as may be amended. New development assessed an
impact fee under Ordinance #04-22 shall not be eligible for any discounts
provided for in Section
17-17 of this chapter.
   C.   When a land use of a new development is not listed in Exhibit B of Ord.
22-7, and Ord. 22-478, the County Engineer may determine the land use
classification which most closely compares with the new development, which land
use shall apply for purposes of determining the applicable impact fee under
this Section. For land uses not specifically listed in Exhibit B of Ord. 22-
7 and Ord. 22-478, the County may, at the discretion of the County Engineer,
determine an appropriate impact fee based on data published in the latest
edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual
pursuant to Section
17-20  of this chapter. Where land uses are not specifically listed in Exhibit
B of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478, or the latest edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual, the County may, at the
discretion of the County Engineer, determine an appropriate impact fee based on
accepted traffic engineering practices, published data, the impact fee per trip
provided in Exhibit D of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478, and the formula set forth
in Section
17-20  of this chapter.
   D.   Where new development is a change in the existing land use, the amount
of the impact fee shall be based on the net increase in trips generated by the
new development, and the formula set forth in Section
17-20 of this chapter shall be used to calculate the impact fee.
   E.   Speculative industrial new development for which the use of the
building(s) therein has not been determined at the time a building permit is to
be requested will be assessed by one of the following methods:
      1.   Assessed at the highest rates of the impact fee based on the new
development.
      2.   Assessed at a reduced contingent fee via a Fee Payment Agreement per
Section
17-20.
      3.   Assessed pursuant to a standard individual assessment or simplified
individual assessment contained in Section
17-20.
   F.   Where a proposed new development is to be located within two (2)
service areas, the County Engineer shall assess the impact fee as follows:
      1.   In the case of residential new development, the impact fee shall be
determined by counting the number of dwelling units located within each service
area of the new development and charging a per-unit cost for the dwelling units
within each service area.
      2.   In the case of non-residential new development, the impact fee shall
be determined by calculating the average of the impact fees that would
otherwise be charged if the new development were located entirely within each
service area. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-15: EXEMPTIONS:
The following new development shall be exempt from payment of any impact fees
imposed by this chapter:
   A.   Alterations or expansion of an existing dwelling unit where no
additional units are created and the use of the unit is not changed;
   B.   Nonresidential new development where an existing building will be
structurally altered or enlarged and does not exceed the lesser of:
      1.   Twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet of floor area; or
      2.   Twenty-five percent (25%) of the existing floor area square footage
of the building; where
         a.   The nonresidential new development does not require a zoning
change; and
         b.   Where additional trips created by the alteration or enlargement
does not exceed ten percent (10%) of trips per the existing land use; or
         c.   Where the alteration is required by the County's or a
Municipality's building code;
   C.   The construction of nonresidential accessory buildings which do not
constitute an increase in intensity of the existing use;
   D.   The reconstruction of a destroyed or partially destroyed building with
a new building of the same size and use;
   E.   Publicly owned and operated school buildings;
   F.   Public buildings owned, operated and occupied by government agencies;
   G.   Temporary structures;
   H.   Affordable housing. Each housing unit (or a designated percentage of
the housing units in multi-family housing developments) meeting the definition
of "affordable housing" and the requirements of this Section shall be exempt
from payment of an impact fee. The County Engineer shall establish procedures
to ensure that rental housing developments qualifying for this exemption
continue to meet the minimum affordability requirements of the Illinois Housing
Development Authority for a period of ten (10) years. If a rental housing
development fails to meet the affordability requirement in any year, the impact
fee that would otherwise have been due shall be paid in full by the owner of
record; and
   I.   Private schools. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-16: DEMOLITION CREDITS:
   A.   A fee payer or developer shall be entitled to a demolition credit equal
to the dollar value of the reduced impact fee that would have been charged on
the building(s) being demolished if part of a redevelopment plan or new
development. A demolition credit shall not exceed the reduced impact fee for
the new development.
   B.   At the time of application for an impact fee receipt, the person
applying for an impact fee receipt shall present to the County a copy of the
demolition permit or letter of authorization from the unit of local government
issuing the demolition approval. The demolition permit shall be attached to the
impact fee receipt application and demolition credits shall be calculated based
upon the impact fee schedule in effect as of the date the impact fee is
assessed. Demolition credits shall be deducted from the gross impact fee
calculated for the new development.
   C.   The County shall not grant demolition credits for demolitions not
associated with new development. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-
13-2022)

   G.   Impact Fee Discount Application: In order to receive the impact fee
discount described in this Section, the developer shall submit an impact fee
discount application to the Division of Transportation Impact Fee Program
Manager. The impact fee discount application shall include an overall plan of
the new development, a description of the permitted and anticipated land uses,
and detailed calculations clearly demonstrating that the new development meets
the requirements listed in this Section and a schedule indicating the
anticipated year of construction of the various phases and elements of the new
development. The Division of Transportation may establish further requirements
for an impact fee discount application as needed for proper administration of
the requirements of this Section.
      1.   Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a written impact fee
discount application, the County Engineer shall determine if all pertinent
information has been provided by the developer. If the County Engineer
determines that additional documentation is required, the County Engineer shall
send a written statement to the developer specifying the deficiencies. Until
the deficiencies are corrected, the County shall take no further action on the
application for an impact fee discount.
      2.   When the County Engineer determines that the application for an
impact fee discount is complete, the County Engineer shall draft an impact fee
payment agreement for the review and approval of the fee payer pursuant to
Section
17-19.
   H.   Impact Fee Discount Payment: As a condition of receiving an impact fee
discount of greater than twenty percent (20%) under this Section, the developer
shall enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the County Engineer. The
Memorandum of Agreement shall provide that the developer will construct the new
development in accordance with the supporting documents submitted with the
impact fee discount application, within a period not to exceed ten (10) years.
The agreement shall also include a commitment by the developer that if the new
development is not completed in accordance with the impact fee discount
application within ten (10) years of the date of the impact fee payment
agreement, or if there is a material change in the new development that would
result in:
      1.   Its ineligibility to receive an impact fee discount; or
      2.   Its receiving a lesser impact fee discount, then the developer shall
pay or cause to be paid to the County an amount equal to the impact fee
discount or excess impact fee discount received.
The duration of the impact fee discount may be extended beyond the ten (10)
year period upon mutual agreement of the County and the developer, provided
that portions of the new development completed within ten (10) years meet the
qualification requirements for the discount obtained and that additional
portions of the development receiving the discount after the ten (10) year
period continue to meet the requirements for the discount obtained. The County
Engineer may, as a condition of the Memorandum of Agreement, require an impact
fee payment agreement with the County in accordance with Section
17-19 of this chapter, which also may include provision of a guaranty in a form
acceptable to the County to ensure such payment.
   I.   Impact Fee Discount Exemptions: New development shall be eligible for a
one hundred percent (100%) discount from the impact fee assessed in accordance
with Section
17-14 of this chapter, provided:
      1.   It is solely owned and solely occupied by a charitable organization
certified by the Internal Revenue Service as tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code; and
      2.   The total site generates fifty (50) or fewer weekday P.M. peak hour
trips as determined using the methodology contained in Appendix A of the CRIP.
Sites that generate greater than fifty (50) weekday P.M. peak hour trips but
otherwise meet the requirements of this Section shall receive a total maximum
discount the amount of which is determined by multiplying the applicable impact
fee per trip from Exhibit D of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478, by the applicable
impact fee multiplier from Exhibit C of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478, and
multiplying the result by fifty (50). In order to receive this discount, the
charitable organization shall provide satisfactory evidence of its federal tax-
exempt status. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-18: PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   Except as may be otherwise provided in subsections B. and C. of this
Section, impact fees for any new development assessed pursuant to any previous,
or current Ordinance shall, prior to the issuance of a building permit by
either a municipality or the County, be paid in full, or in the case of
Speculative Industrial new development, upon the issuance of an occupancy
permit therefor.
   B.   In the event that a building permit or certificate of occupancy is
issued by a municipality without an impact fee having been paid, the County may
collect the impact fee from the fee payer or the fee payer's successor in title
at any time thereafter. In conjunction with the collection of any impact fee or
portion thereof that remains unpaid or is otherwise due, the County may file in
the Office of the Kane County Recorder notification of an unpaid impact fee.
Any judgement obtained by the County as result of any action filed in a court
of competent jurisdiction for the collection of impact fees that remain due,
owing and unpaid, shall bear the rate of interest as provided in the Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2-1303).
   C.   Payment of an impact fee may be authorized at a time earlier than as
otherwise specified in subsections A. of this Section if the County and the fee
payer enter into an impact fee payment agreement that provides for such earlier
payment of the impact fee. At the option of the County, the County may enter
into an impact fee payment agreement with a fee payer pursuant to Section
17-19 hereof that provides for the installment payment of the impact fee at a
rate of interest which is three percent (3%) over the prime commercial rate in
effect at the time that the impact fee is imposed, for a period of up to ten
(10) years after the impact fee is due, provided that the County receives, in
the opinion of the County, adequate security ensuring such later payment of the
impact fee. In all impact fee payment agreements, interest on any unpaid Impact
fee or part thereof shall begin accruing on the first business day following
submittal of the impact fee application.
   D.   Developers of residential new development which receives assisted
financing, or who have received a written commitment for assisted financing and
whose assisted financing has been provided within six (6) months of the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, may enter into an impact fee payment
agreement with the County whereby the impact fee may be paid in installments
over a ten (10) year period of time at a rate of interest which is three
percent (3%) over the prime commercial rate in effect at the time that the
impact fee is assessed.
   E.   The County and any municipality may enter into an intergovernmental
agreement that provides for the cooperative collection of impact fees and/or
for the conditioning of the issuance of municipal building permits or
certificates of occupancy upon proof of payment of the County's impact fee.
   F.   Municipalities shall provide the County with a notice of issuance of
any building permit in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Municipal
Code of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (65 ILCS 5/11-39-1), and shall submit a
copy of the fee payer's receipt of payment of the impact fee or a County
approved impact fee payment agreement along with such notice. (Ord. 22-27, 1-
11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-19: IMPACT FEE PAYMENT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   At any time prior to the issuance of a building permit, a fee payer may
enter into an impact fee payment agreement with the County providing for the
payment of the impact fee imposed by this chapter, in accordance with
requirements specified by the County Engineer. Such impact fee payment
agreement may provide for the following:
      1.   Installment payments of the impact fee for a period up to ten (10)
years, (only in the case of new development funded by assisted financing);
      2.   Recapture payments for improvement credits;
      3.   Credit and security arrangements; and
      4.   Other matters relating to the impact fee.
In addition, any impact fee payment agreement may also include an improvement
credit agreement as provided for in Section
17-21 of this chapter.
   B.   For new development eligible for deferred payment of an impact fee, the
impact fee payment agreement may require security, the form of which shall be
determined at the sole option of the County. Security may be in the form of a
promissory note, cash bond, security bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or
a lien or mortgage on the lands to be covered by the building permit, among
other things. The impact fee payment agreement may provide that such security
may be partially releasable upon receipt of partial payments of the impact fee.
Fee payers receiving assisted financing shall be charged a rate of interest
which is three percent (3%) over the prime commercial rate in effect at the
time that the impact fee is assessed, on any deferred impact fee payments.
   C.   Fee payers for any new development other than residential new
development and fee payers for multi-unit residential new development will be
allowed to enter into impact fee payment agreements to defer payment of some
portion of the impact fees due upon the issuance of a building permit. Impact
fee payment agreements shall provide that a payment of at least fifty percent
(50%) of the assessed impact fee or any impact fee credits in lieu of cash
shall be payable upon the issuance of a building permit, and the balance shall
be payable in twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of the building
permit. Fee payers shall be charged a rate of interest that is three percent
(3%) over the prime commercial rate in effect at the time that the impact fee
is assessed, on any impact fees deferred in accordance with this Section for
new development eligible for deferred payment of an impact fee, through an
impact fee discount agreement.
   D.   For new development approved for impact fee discounts pursuant to
Section
17-17 of this chapter, the impact fee payment agreement shall provide that the
developer will construct the new development in accordance with the supporting
documents submitted with the impact fee discount application, within a period
not to exceed ten (10) years. The impact fee payment agreement must also
include a commitment by the developer that if the new development is not
completed in accordance with the impact fee discount application within ten
(10) years of the date of the impact fee payment agreement, or if there is a
material change in the new development that would result in:
      1.   Its ineligibility to receive an impact fee discount; or
      2.   Its receiving a lesser impact fee discount, then the developer shall
pay or cause to be paid to the County an amount equal to the impact fee
discount or excess impact fee discount received.
The duration of the impact fee discount may be extended beyond the ten (10)
year period upon mutual agreement of the County and the developer, provided
that portions of the new development completed within ten (10) years meet the
qualification requirements for the discount obtained and that additional
portions of the development receiving the discount after the ten (10) year
period continue to meet the requirements for the discount obtained. The County
may, as a condition of the impact fee payment agreement, require a guaranty in
a form acceptable to the County to ensure such payment.
   E.   Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a written application
for an impact fee payment agreement, the County Engineer shall determine if all
pertinent information has been provided by the fee payer. If the County
Engineer determines that additional documentation is required, the County
Engineer shall send a written statement to the fee payer specifying the
deficiencies in the application. Until the deficiencies are corrected, the
County shall take no further action on the application for an impact fee
payment agreement.
   F.   When the County Engineer determines that the application for an impact
fee payment agreement is complete, the County Engineer shall draft an impact
fee payment agreement for the review and approval of the fee payer. Upon
acceptance of the impact fee payment agreement by the fee payer, the
Transportation Committee shall consider the impact fee payment agreement at its
next regularly scheduled meeting that will comply with the requirements of the
Illinois Open Meetings Act. If the Transportation Committee approves the impact
fee payment agreement, the County Engineer may execute the agreement on behalf
of the County. The Transportation Committee's denial of an impact fee payment
agreement shall be based on written findings. Said written findings shall
indicate that the impact fee payment agreement is not in the best interest of
the County. Reasons for such finding may include but are not necessarily
limited to the extraordinary potential adverse impact of the new development
among other things. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-20: INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT - SIMPLIFIED AND STANDARD ANALYSIS:
   A.   Any developer may choose to provide an individual assessment of the
impacts of the proposed new development upon the County highway system. The
individual assessment may be used by the County to determine:
      1.   Whether the share of the highway improvement capital costs
necessitated by the proposed new development should be less than the impact fee
established in Section
17-14 of this chapter; or
      2.   The impact fee for a particular land use or combination of uses not
otherwise identified in Section
17-14 of this chapter. There are two types of individual assessments available.
   B.   Simplified:
      1.   Where the impact fee assessed under Section
17-14  of this chapter does not reflect the impact of the proposed new
development, and where the latest version of the Institute of Transportation
Engineers Trip Generation Manual provides trip generation data for another Land
Use Code(s) which more closely represents the data for the new development, the
developer may complete a simplified individual assessment.
      2.   Any developer who requests a simplified individual assessment is
required to submit an application for a simplified individual assessment to the
County Engineer (see Exhibit E of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478).
      3.   The County Engineer will review the application for a simplified
individual assessment within fifteen (15) working days of receipt. If the
County Engineer determines the application is not complete, the County Engineer
shall send a written statement specifying the deficiencies to the person
submitting the application. Until the deficiencies are corrected, the County
Engineer shall take no further action on the application for simplified
individual assessment, other than further reviews for completeness.
      4.   The County may, at the discretion of the County Engineer, have the
simplified individual assessment reviewed by an approved transportation
professional. The County Engineer shall approve the proposed impact fee if the
County Engineer determines that the data provided in the latest version of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual accurately
represents the trip generation characteristics anticipated for the new
development. If the County Engineer determines that use of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual data does not fairly assess the
highway improvement capital costs to the County highway system in accordance
with the formula set out in subsection H. of this Section the proposed impact
fee shall be denied, and the developer shall pay the impact fee according to
the schedule established in Section
17-14  of this chapter if the new development's proposed land use has not
previously been identified in the impact fee schedule or an amount as otherwise
determined by the County Engineer.
      5.   If the simplified individual assessment is denied by the County
Engineer, the developer retains the ability to perform a full standard
individual assessment pursuant to this Section.
   C.   Standard:
      1.   Any developer who chooses to provide a standard individual
assessment is required to submit to the County Engineer a written statement of
intent to perform a standard individual assessment, including its intended
methodology, prior to performing the standard individual assessment and
commencing the new development.
      2.   The individual assessment shall be calculated according to the
following formulas (See Technical Specifications for detailed information):
PRIMARY TRIP RATE = GROSS TRIP RATE x TOTAL TRIP REDUCTION
TRIPS = PRIMARY TRIP RATE x NUMBER OF IMPACT UNITS
GROSS IMPACT FEE = TRIPS x IMPACT FEE PER TRIP
NET IMPACT FEE = GROSS IMPACT FEE minus DEMOLITION CREDIT minus IMPROVEMENT
CREDIT
REDUCED IMPACT FEE = NET IMPACT FEE x IMPACT FEE MULTIPLIER
Where:
GROSS TRIP RATE; equals the number of trips generated by one IMPACT UNIT of the
new development on a weekday during the peak hour, between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00
p.m., of adjacent street traffic, as defined in the latest edition of the
Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual. 
TOTAL TRIP REDUCTION: equals the percentage of trips generated by a new
development that are pass-by trips or diverted-linked trips as defined in the
latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation
Handbook.
PRIMARY TRIP RATE; equals the portion of the GROSS TRIP RATE that represents
new trips on the County highway system, discounting pass-by and diverted-linked
trips.
IMPACT UNITS; equals a measure of the size of the new development that
correlates with the number of peak hour trips generated by the new development
between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. For residential new developments, the IMPACT
UNIT is the number of dwelling units of various types in the new development.
For non-residential new developments, the IMPACT UNIT is generally a multiple
of the number of gross interior square feet of the buildings constructed in the
new development.
IMPACT FEE PER TRIP: equals the GROSS IMPACT FEE for the service area for new
development that generates one trip during the peak hour of adjacent highway
traffic between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. (See Exhibit D of Ord. 22-7 and Ord.
22-478).
DEMOLITION CREDIT: equals the GROSS IMPACT FEE that would have been assessed on
a building that a fee payer demolishes in conjunction with new development.
IMPROVEMENT CREDIT: equals the value of impact fee eligible highway
improvements constructed by a developer in conjunction with new development and
pursuant to an improvement credit agreement with the County.
IMPACT FEE MULTIPLIER; equals the percentage determined by the County Board by
which the NET FEE shall be multiplied to determine the REDUCED FEE (See Exhibit
C of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478).
      3.   The standard individual assessment shall include the following
information:
         a.   The trip generation rates for the proposed new development, on an
average daily and on a peak design hour basis. The trip generation rates shall
be based on local empirical surveys for the same or similar land use types.
Empirical surveys shall include data collected from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm at a
minimum of three (3) locations having the same or similar land uses, or three
(3) consecutive days at the same location. Survey locations should be similar
to the location of the new development in terms of land use, adjacent street
daily traffic, and mobility options. Coordination with the Division of
Transportation impact fee program manager is required for survey locations
outside of Kane County
         b.   The proposed trip reduction rates for pass-by and diverted-linked
trips, if any. The trip reduction rates shall be based on data provided in the
latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation
Handbook or local empirical surveys for the same or similar land use types.
         c.   Any other data and supporting calculations that demonstrate a
lower impact fee would be justified due to the unique nature or location of the
new development.
      4.   An individual assessment shall be prepared only by a Professional
Traffic Operations Engineer (PTOE) licensed in the state of Illinois utilizing
established procedures, in the field of transportation planning and engineering
and impact analysis. The standard individual assessment shall be stamped and
signed by the qualified engineer.
      5.   The maximum reduction in any impact fee determined through any
individual assessment, standard or simplified shall not exceed seventy percent
(70%) of the impact fee as initially determined by and set forth in the impact
fee schedule.
      6.   Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of an individual
assessment, the County Engineer shall determine if the standard individual
assessment application materials are complete. If the County Engineer
determines the standard individual assessment application is not complete, the
County Engineer shall send a written statement specifying the deficiencies to
the person submitting the standard individual assessment. The County may, at
the discretion of the County Engineer, have the individual assessment reviewed
by an approved transportation professional. Until the deficiencies are
corrected, the County Engineer shall take no further action on the standard
individual assessment, other than further reviews for completeness.
      7.   When the County Engineer determines the standard individual
assessment is complete, the standard individual assessment shall be reviewed by
the County within thirty (30) days thereafter. The County Engineer shall
approve the proposed impact fee if the County Engineer determines that the
traffic information, traffic factors, and methodology used to determine the
proposed impact fee are professionally acceptable and fairly assess the highway
improvement capital costs to the County highway system in accordance with the
formula set out in subsection H. of this Section. If the County Engineer
determines that the traffic information, traffic factors, or methodology does
not fairly assess the highway improvement capital costs to the County highway
system in accordance with the formula set out in subsection H. of this Section,
the proposed impact fee shall be denied, and the developer shall pay the impact
fee according to the schedule established in Section
17-14 of this chapter or as otherwise determined by the County Engineer if the
new development's proposed land use has not previously been identified in the
impact fee schedule. If the individual assessment is denied by the County
Engineer, the decision of the County Engineer may be appealed in the manner
provided for in Section
17-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-21: IMPACT FEE CREDIT AGREEMENTS:
   A.   Any fee payer may request an impact fee credit against the impact fee
imposed by this chapter for any contribution, payment, recapture or
construction of a system improvement or conveyance of land accepted and
received by Kane County for any system improvement in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. Highway related improvements made primarily for the
benefit of the new development or municipalities or individuals or entities
other than the County, including but not limited to highway related
improvements such as turn lanes, traffic signals at private entrances,
improvements to cross streets not on the County highway system over and above
those necessary for the efficient operation of County intersections, and
improvements to private property, together with the engineering and right of
way costs therefor, are not eligible for an improvement credit. Any
contribution, payment, recapture, construction of a highway related improvement
or conveyance of land accepted and received by the County that does not address
a capacity deficiency as set forth in the CRIP or that is received by the
County as third party beneficiary as consideration included in any annexation
agreement or as consideration for a grant from the County of any benefit to the
new development that the new development is not otherwise entitled to as a
matter of law, is not eligible as an improvement credit. The County Engineer
shall determine which improvements are system improvements eligible for an
improvement credit.
   B.   The County shall not be required to refund any impact fee or part
thereof for any impact fee credits that exceed any impact fee assessed by this
chapter for the new development. However, a fee payer or his or her successor
in interest may apply an improvement credit which has not otherwise been used
in any other improvement credit agreement against an impact fee which would
otherwise be due and owing under the provisions of this chapter, provided that
the highway improvement for which the credit is being applied is located within
the same service area as the new development which would be the beneficiary of
the credit and provided that the credit application is made within five (5)
years of the date of execution of the original improvement credit agreement.
   C.   A fee payer shall be entitled to an improvement credit equal to the
dollar value of the cost of any eligible system improvement contributed, paid
for or committed to by the fee payer or his or her predecessor in interest in
conjunction with the County's approval of the new development which is subject
to the impact fee for which an improvement credit is being sought. The cost of
such highway improvements shall be based on the following criteria:
      1.   The actual cost of the system improvements based on a valid contract
proposal or bid tabulations for work performed within Kane County on the County
highway system; and
      2.   The mean value of two legitimate, unbiased, qualified appraisals,
conducted by an Illinois licensed real estate appraiser, of the fair market
value of any land or interest therein which is part of the system improvement
for which an impact fee credit is being sought. The fee payer or developer and
the County shall each provide the legitimate, qualified unbiased appraisal from
which the mean shall be determined.
   D.   To be eligible to receive an impact fee credit, the fee payer or
developer shall initiate such determination requesting an improvement credit by
submitting a written application prepared by an Illinois licensed civil
engineer for an improvement credit agreement to the County Engineer, no later
than the fee payer's application for:
      1.   The related building permit; or
      2.   The related highway access permit; whichever occurs first. The
application for an improvement credit agreement shall include the following
information:
         a.   A plan of specific proposed system improvements, prepared and
certified by a duly qualified and licensed Illinois civil engineer; and,
         b.   The projected costs for the proposed system improvements, which
shall be based on local information for similar highway improvements, along
with the construction timetable for the completion of the proposed system
improvements. Such estimated costs shall include the cost of all labor and
materials, the appraised value or cost of all lands, property, rights,
easements and franchises acquired, financing charges, interest prior to and
during construction and for one (1) year after completion of construction, cost
of plans and specifications, surveys of estimated costs and of revenues, costs
of engineering and legal services and all other expenses necessary or
incidental to determining the feasibility or practicability of such
construction or reconstruction.
   E.   Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the application for an
impact fee credit agreement, the County Engineer shall determine if all
pertinent information has been provided. If the County Engineer determines that
additional information is required, the County Engineer shall send a written
statement outlining the application's deficiencies to the applicant. The County
Engineer shall take no further action on the proposed improvement credit
agreement, other than further reviews for completeness, until all deficiencies
have been corrected or otherwise settled.
   F.   Once the County Engineer determines that the applicant's proposed
improvement is a system improvement and the proposed costs for the suggested
system improvement are professionally acceptable and fairly assess its cost,
the County Engineer shall draft an impact fee credit agreement that shall be
reviewed and approved by the applicant submitting the request for the impact
fee credit agreement. The impact fee credit agreement shall specifically
outline the system improvements that will be constructed by the applicant, the
time by which the system improvements shall be completed and the total dollar
value of the proposed system improvements. If the County Engineer determines
that either the proposed system improvement is not a system improvement or that
the proposed costs thereof are not acceptable, the County Engineer shall notify
the applicant of his/her decision and may propose an alternative system
improvement and proposed costs therefor consistent with the provisions of this
chapter.
   G.   Upon written acceptance of the impact fee credit agreement by the
County Engineer and the applicant, the Transportation Committee shall consider
the impact fee credit agreement at the next regularly scheduled committee
meeting that will comply with the requirements of the Illinois Open Meetings
Act. If the Transportation Committee approves the impact fee credit agreement,
the County Engineer may execute the impact fee credit agreement on behalf of
the County. Any impact fee credit agreement that includes system improvements
with a total dollar value over one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) shall
be reviewed and ratified by the County Board before it is executed by the
County Engineer.
   H.   The Division of Transportation shall maintain records of the use of
impact fee credits toward payment of impact fees due and shall provide upon
written request a quarterly statement to the beneficiary of each impact fee
credit agreement indicating use of any impact fee credits during the reporting
period and the balance of impact fee credits remaining. Upon execution of an
impact fee credit agreement, the beginning balance shall be equal to the total
dollar value of the impact feet credits as specified in the impact fee credit
agreement. Impact fee credits will be applied against new development in the
following manner:
      1.   The recipient of the impact fee credit shall indicate on the impact
fee application that impact fees assessed will be paid by utilizing impact fee
credits and shall indicate the impact fee credit agreement number.
      2.   For each portion of the new development to which an impact fee
credit is intended to be applied, the Division of Transportation shall
calculate the gross impact fee in accordance with Exhibit B of Ord. 22-7 and
Ord. 22-478 or in accordance with Section
17-20 of this chapter. The remaining impact feet credit balance shall be
reduced by the gross impact fee for that portion of the new development. The
impact fee receipt shall note that the impact fees were paid through
application of impact fee credits and the amount of impact fee credit expended.
      3.   If the impact fee credits remaining are insufficient to cover the
gross impact fee for the new development, the remaining gross impact fee shall
be multiplied by the impact fee multiplier then in effect and the applicant
notified of the impact fee due. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-
13-2022)
17-22: REFUNDS:
   A.   Any impact fee collected may be refunded to the fee payer for the new
development due to non-commencement before the impact fees have been expended
or otherwise encumbered. Refunds may be made in accordance with this Section,
provided that the fee payer or his or her successor in interest files a written
petition for a refund of impact fees paid, within one (1) year of the date that
the impact fees were required to be encumbered or expended.
   B.   Impact fees collected shall be encumbered for any of the purposes
listed in Section
17-24 of this chapter within five (5) years of the date of receipt thereof. In
determining whether the funds have been encumbered, the impact fees shall be
accounted for on a first-in - first-out (FIFO) basis.
   C.   The impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter that have not been
encumbered in accordance with subsection B. of this Section shall be returned
to the owner of record only upon receipt of a petition therefor. The petition
shall include the following information:
      1.   A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the owner of
record of the new development for which the impact fee was paid and that the
petitioner is entitled to a refund under the terms of this chapter;
      2.   A certified copy of the latest recorded deed for the property that
comprises the new development for which the impact fee was paid; and
      3.   A copy of the most recent ad valorem property tax bill for the
property that comprises the new development for which the impact fee was paid.
   D.   Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the written request, the
County Engineer shall determine if the written request is complete. If the
County Engineer determines the refund request is not complete, the County
Engineer shall send a written statement by U.S. mail or email specifying the
deficiencies to the petitioner. Unless the request's deficiencies are
corrected, the County Engineer shall take no further action on the request.
   E.   When the County Engineer determines the written petition for refund of
impact fees paid is complete, the County Engineer shall review the petition
within fifteen (15) working days, and shall approve the requested refund if the
County Engineer determines the fee payer has paid an impact fee which the
County has neither expended nor encumbered within five (5) years from the date
the impact fee was paid.
   F.   If any impact fee has not been expended or otherwise encumbered within
five (5) years of the date the impact fee were received, upon receipt of a
complete refund petition as determined by the County Engineer, the impact fee
shall be refunded along with interest at a rate which is seventy percent (70%)
of the prime commercial rate in effect at the time that the impact fee is
imposed, less five percent (5%) of the total fee to defray the costs of
administration.
   G.   Impact fee refunds may be made at the discretion of the County Engineer
without petition in any case where inadvertent mathematical error resulting in
overpayment has been made.
   H.   Any charitable organization certified by the Internal Revenue Service
as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, and when so
certified paid an impact fee under Kane County Ordinance 04-22 for new
development that is solely owned and solely occupied by the charitable
organization shall, upon written application to the Kane County Engineer,
receive a one-time refund in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of
the impact fee that would have been assessed on an equivalent land use that
generates fifty (50) weekday PM peak hour trips, or an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the impact fee paid, whichever amount is less. (Ord.
22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-23: ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE AREAS:
There are hereby established service areas within the County in accordance with
the boundaries set forth on Exhibit A of Ord. 22-7 and Ord. 22-478. The impact
fee funds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be expended within the
service area(s) from which they were collected, in accordance with the
provisions of Section
17-24 of this chapter. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-24: USE OF IMPACT FEES COLLECTED:
   A.   The impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used in the
same manner and for the same purposes as motor fuel tax money allotted to the
County under the provisions of the Highway Code, (605 ILCS 5/5-701 et seq.)
solely for highway improvement capital costs that are specifically and uniquely
attributable to the new development assessed the impact fee. In no event shall
impact fees be expended to alleviate existing deficiencies in the County's
highway system which were identified in the CRIP that was the basis for the
original Road Improvement Impact Fees adopted by the County. The impact fees
shall be expended on system improvements within the service area(s) from which
the impact fees were collected, as specified in the CRIP. In the event that a
service area boundary is the centerline of a County highway or intersection,
the County Engineer may use the impact fees to complete the system improvements
to the opposite side of the highway or right of way. Co-mingling of impact fees
with regular highway, local gasoline or state motor fuel tax funds on highway
improvements is permissible to the extent that regular tax funds are used to
pay for the cost of alleviating any existing deficiencies. The County Engineer
shall provide a written justification of the allocation of impact fees whenever
such impact fees are allocated to highway improvements that will remedy
existing deficiencies, demonstrating that the impact fees are not used to
improve said existing deficiencies.
   B.   Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within five (5) years from
the date of receipt thereof.
   C.   Impact fees collected by the County pursuant to this chapter shall be
kept separate from other funds of the County.
   D.   Impact fees collected shall accrue to the fund established for the
service area(s) in which the new development is proposed or occurs.
   E.   Impact fees on deposit and not immediately necessary for expenditure
shall be invested in interest bearing accounts designated solely for the impact
fees for each service area(s). All interest derived therefrom shall be retained
in the appropriate fund and used for highway improvements authorized in this
chapter.
   F.   The County shall provide for an annual accounting of any fund or
account containing impact fees and interest earned thereon. Such accounting
shall include, but shall not be limited to, the total impact fees collected,
the source of the impact fees collected, the total amount of interest accruing
on such impact fees, the amount of impact fees expended on highway
improvements, and a list of the impact fee credits granted. The County shall
publish the results of the accounting once a year in a newspaper of general
circulation within Kane County. The notice shall also state that a copy of the
accounting report shall be made available for public inspection at reasonable
times. A copy of the report shall be given to the Advisory Committee.
   G.   Impact fees collected pursuant to Ordinance 04-22 and impact fees
assessed pursuant to Section
17-14 of this chapter may be expended on any eligible highway improvement
identified in the CRIP in effect at the time of award of the contract for
expenditure of the impact fees; however, impact fees collected pursuant to
Ordinance 04-22 and impact fees assessed pursuant to Section
17-14 of this chapter shall be expended within the service area as defined in
Ordinance 04-22 from which the impact fees were collected. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-
2022; amd. Ord. 22-478, 12-13-2022)
17-25: ADVISORY COMMITTEE:
   A.   An Advisory Committee has been established by the County in compliance
with the requirements of the Road Improvement Impact Fee Law to assist the
County in the recommendation of land use assumptions and the development of the
CRIP. After the effective date of this chapter, the Advisory Committee shall,
among other duties, continue to:
      1.   Report to the County on all matters relating to the imposition of
impact fees;
      2.   Monitor and evaluate the implementation of the CRIP and the
assessment of impact fees;
      3.   Report annually to the County with respect to the progress of the
implementation of the CRIP;
      4.   Advise the County of the need to update or revise the land use
assumptions, CRIP, or impact fees;
      5.   Review the County's highway program with respect to impact fee
expenditures; and
      6.   Discuss relevant development trends in the County.
   B.   The County shall adopt procedural rules to be used by the Advisory
Committee in carrying out the duties imposed by this Section. The rules shall
provide that any three (3) members of the Advisory Committee may call a meeting
of the Committee to discuss issues that fall within the duties listed above.
The County shall assist the Advisory Committee and shall make available all

assessment provided for in Section
17-21, the factors used for a standard individual assessment provided for in
Section
17-21, the administration of this chapter and the Procedures Manual, and shall
revise the impact fee schedule in accordance with any changes in the factors
used in calculating the impact fee. The review shall not affect the

Board. If the County Engineer determines that the arithmetic average of any
proposed increase in the impact fees will be five percent (5%) or greater from
the previous impact fee schedule, the County shall hold a public hearing
regarding the proposed revisions to the impact fee schedule. The County shall
give thirty (30) days' notice of such public hearing by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation within Kane County. A majority vote of the
members of the County Board then holding office is required before the impact
fees may be increased. In no event shall this subsection or any other Section
of this chapter be construed to prevent the County Board from taking any action
to amend this chapter after its effective date.
   B.   Regarding any revision of the impact fee schedule, the maximum annual
increase for any one year shall not be more than ten percent (10%) plus any
increase in the Construction Cost Index (as published by the Engineering News
Record) for said year.
   C.   Any impact fee increase or decrease shall become effective on April 1st
of the year that the impact fee schedule is approved by the County Board. If
there has been a State or County gas tax increase or decrease, a revised fee
schedule may be considered by the Transportation Committee at a regularly
scheduled meeting and subsequently by the County Board at the next regularly
scheduled County Board meeting thereafter. Any revised impact fee schedule
approved by the County Board shall reflect the allocation of such gas tax funds
to transportation capacity improvements.
   D.   An annual report shall be provided to the County Board that examines
the expenditure of the impact fees collected under the provisions of this
chapter and analyzes the effectiveness of such expenditures. The annual report
shall be produced prior to June 1 of every year.

shall not apply to any amendment to this chapter resulting from a complete
update of the Land Use Assumptions and Comprehensive Road Improvement Plan in
accordance with the Road Improvement Impact Fee Law. (Ord. 22-27, 1-11-2022;

any interest accruing on any judgement resulting therefrom.
   B.   Unless a fee payer is actively prosecuting the appeal of an impact fee,
or actively prosecuting any other remedy provided by law for relief against an
impact fee, if an impact fee required by this chapter has not been timely paid,
the County or the County Engineer shall not issue to the delinquent fee payer
any subsequent approvals or permits for any other development or work within
the County of Kane in which the delinquent fee payer has an interest and shall
suspend review of any and all pending applications or petitions of the

      3.   the amount included in the second notice of nonpayment was not paid
before the date specified in the notice; and
      4.   the alleged violator was the registered owner or the driver of the
vehicle when the unpaid toll was assessed. Such proof may be established by a
record from the Illinois Secretary of State, the department of motor vehicles
of any other state, or other credible source; or by affidavit or contract
document from the registered owner indicating that the vehicle was in the
possession of the alleged violator pursuant to a valid rental car agreement at
the time of the incurrence of the toll and the registered owner was not the
driver at the time that the unpaid toll was assessed.
   G.   Proof may be established by testimony of a peace officer or a county
employee, video surveillance records, records of the county toll bridge
customer service center or agent of the county responsible for processing toll
invoices, copies of notices of non-payment and violations, or any other
reasonable evidence, including a copy of the rental, lease, or other contract
document or the electronic data provided to the county. Nonpayment by the
registered owner of the vehicle also may be established by a copy of a written
agreement between the county and the registered owner for the payment of unpaid
tolls and administrative fees; and evidence that the registered owner is in
default under the agreement.
   H.   The administrative judge shall issue a final order of liability, if the
person responsible for paying a toll violation:
      1.   is found liable for the toll violation pursuant to Sections
17-47  and
17-48 ;
      2.   requests an administrative hearing and fails to appear or fails to
submit supporting documentation and fails to pay the fine;
      3.   fails to pay any or all of the amounts due by the toll violation due
date.
      Upon the issuance of the final order of liability, the liable person is
responsible for paying the civil penalty in addition to all of the unpaid tolls
and administrative fees.
   I.   The administrative judge may find a person not liable for
administrative fees and/or civil penalty. Notwithstanding the same, in all
cases, where the administrative judge finds that the alleged violator used the
toll bridge but did not pay, the administrative judge shall assess, at a
minimum, the applicable license plate toll(s) for the use of the toll bridge.
   J.   Judicial review of final determinations of ordinance violations are
subject to the provisions of the Administrative Hearing Law.
   K.   The county may enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the
Illinois State Toll Highway Authority under which the Authority may provide
administrative adjudication of toll violations occurring on a county toll
bridge.
   L.   Payment of toll amounts, administrative fees and civil penalties shall
be made as directed in the notice of nonpayment and notice of toll violation.
Such funds shall be promptly turned over to the county treasurer to be credited
to the toll bridge fund. (Ord. 20-52, 2-11-2020)
17-49: DEFENSE TO NONPAYMENT; AND REASSIGNMENT:
   A.   It is a defense to nonpayment under this Article if the vehicle in
question was:
      1.   stolen at the time of the incurrence of the toll and was not
recovered by the time of the failure to pay;
      2.   sold and transferred to another individual at the time of the
incurrence of the toll, provided that the owner being held liable for the
unpaid toll provides proof of sale and transfer along with an affidavit that
includes the name and address of the person to whom the vehicle was sold and
date of the transfer of possession of the vehicle;
      3.   driven by a lessee of a car whose registered owner is a rental
company, as defined in 625 ILCS 27/10, at the time of the incurrence of the
toll, and the rental company timely provided proof acceptable to the county to
transfer liability to the lessee.
   B.   Liability for an unpaid toll or toll violations may be reassigned to
another person in the event of a vehicle sale or transfer or lease pursuant to
a valid rental agreement.
      1.   In the case of a vehicle sale, to reassign a toll violation the
person who received the toll invoice or notices must comply with section
17-49 A(2).
      2.   In the case of a vehicle lease, to reassign a toll violation the
rental car company must:
         a.   Be the registered owner of the vehicle.
         b.   Have included a provision in its rental agreement advising the
renter/lessee that the renter/lessee will be responsible for payment of tolls
and any charges related to the nonpayment of tolls and violations.
         c.   Have posted a sign at the rental/leasing counter notifying the
renter/lessee of the responsibility to pay tolls and any related charges. (Ord.

LIMITING LAYER: A horizon or condition in the soil profile or underlying strata
which includes:
   A.   A seasonal high water table, whether perched or regional, determined by
direct observation of the water table or indicated by soil mottling where
common mottles comprise at least two percent (2%) to twenty percent (20%) of
the soil in a progressive downward direction in the soil.
   B.   Masses of loose rock fragments, including gravel, with insufficient
fine soil to fill the voids between the fragments.
   C.   Rock formation, other stratum or soil condition which is so slowly
permeable that it effectively limits downward passage of effluent.
MAINTENANCE: Any activity that is needed to keep the private sewage disposal
system operating properly, such as, but not limited to, the following: pumping
the tank, replacement of tank lid, replacement of septic tank baffles,
replacement of drop box lids, raising inspection ports to grade, adjusting
water elevation in drop boxes, replacing sewer line between tank and seepage
field, replacing pumps, replacing the line between the tank and the seepage
field, or the elimination of depressions over lines, or the installation of
water conservation devices.
REPAIR: Any change to a private sewage disposal system beyond maintenance, such
as replacing the septic tank(s) or removing and replacing any portion of the
septic field, and does require a permit.

the higher standard for the promotion of the health and safety of the people
shall prevail. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-30: COMPLIANCE:
All private sewage disposal systems within the limits of Kane County shall be
constructed, installed, repaired, and maintained by an individual with a valid
private sewage disposal system installation contractor's registration; and all
such systems shall be pumped, cleaned, and the contents disposed of by
individuals with a valid private sewage disposal system pumping contractor's
registration. All private sewage systems shall be cleaned, pumped, or serviced,

18-32: OCCUPANCY:
No person shall occupy or permit occupancy of any building, structure, or
dwelling not in compliance with this chapter. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-33: DISCHARGES OF SEWAGE; IMPROPER OPERATION OF SYSTEMS:
Every private sewage disposal system shall be maintained in a proper sanitary
condition and in a proper state of repair by the owner. It shall be unlawful
for any person to permit or cause the discharge of improperly treated sewage
directly or indirectly to any lake, stream, ditch, ground surface or abandoned
well, or to allow the contents of any privy, vault, septic tank, or private
sewage disposal system or component thereof, to emit any offensive odor, or to
become objectionable so as to be dangerous or prejudicial to the health, safety
and welfare of the public. Upon verification of such unsanitary conditions, the
county health department shall give written notice to the owner and/or legal
occupant responsible for such acts or omissions, ordering abatement of same.
Failure of any person to obey such an abatement order shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-34: APPROVED PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS:
The following systems are approved for private sewage disposal when designed,
constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the applicable
sections in this chapter:
   A.   Septic tank in addition to one of the following:
      1.   Subsurface seepage system.
      2.   Buried sand filter.
      3.   Recirculating sand filter.
   B.   Aquarobic raised filter bed as approved by the Illinois department of
public health (IDPH).
   C.   Aerobic treatment plants discharging to supplementary treatment as
provided in subsection A1, A2 or A3 of this section.
   D.   Alternative systems:
      1.   Privy.
      2.   Chemical toilets.
      3.   Incinerator toilets.
      4.   Compost toilets.
      5.   Recirculating toilets. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-35: ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS:
When an application for a private sewage disposal system permit on an existing
platted lot or parcel of record with residential zoning has been denied due to
the limitations of the soil, or the lot or parcel is too small to install the
required minimum size disposal system and expansion area, an application may be
submitted to the county health department for an alternative system. All other
sections of this chapter shall be met. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-36: VARIANCES:
The county health department may grant a variance provided it does not conflict
with the stated purpose of this chapter. A variance may be requested by
submitting a written proposal to the county health department. Such written
request shall include pertinent data such as soil suitability, drainage
patterns, and distances to water supplies. The capability of the system to
comply with the intent of this chapter will be the basis for approval or denial
of the variance. The county health department shall respond to all variance
requests in writing within ten (10) working days. If the county health
department refuses to issue a variance, the property owner may file with the
county health department a written request for an appeal and hearing as
specified in section
18-48 of this chapter. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-37: SOIL SUITABILITY:
All subsurface seepage fields and seepage beds shall be designed with primary
consideration to soil type. The county health department or contractor may
request a percolation test to provide additional information where it is needed
to assist in determining extent of compaction of soil. Upon notification
percolation tests may be submitted by the installation contractor to the county
health department in lieu of soil evaluations for repairs. Information about
the location of the seasonal high water table must be included. The method that
provides for the largest seepage field or seepage bed will be required. The
soil type shall be determined by the indication of the soil property of three
(3) or more soil borings in the private sewage disposal system area and
designed as to that which most closely compares to the typical soil profile as
described in the soil survey. Subsurface seepage systems shall have at least
two feet (2') of vertical separation distance between the bottom of the
subsurface seepage system and the top of the limiting layer. For soils which
are moderately rapid or rapidly permeable, a vertical separation of three feet
(3') between the bottom of the subsurface seepage system and the top of the
limiting layer is required. When a limiting layer has been identified by a
mottling depth of twenty four inches (24") or less, a curtain drain may be used
to intercept the movement of subsurface water from higher ground toward the
private sewage disposal system provided soils with permeabilities of 0.6 inch/
hour or greater are present, in the area and surrounding area of the subsurface
seepage system from the ground surface to the depth where the curtain drain
tile is to be placed, and a proper drain outlet exists. Full credit for two
feet (2') of vertical separation from seasonal high water table will be given
when the curtain drain is installed in topography of minimum slope of one
percent (1%), two feet (2') lower than seepage field, and soil of a minimum
permeability of 0.6 to one inch (1") per hour. The curtain drain must have a
minimum separation of ten feet (10') from the nearest seepage trench. All
systems installed or repaired in areas designed as special flood hazard areas
must be so constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them
during flooding. (Ord. 97-327, 11-12-1997)
18-38: SOIL INVESTIGATION:
   A.   Determination of soil characteristics on sites proposed for development
with private sewage disposal systems shall be based on the soil data collected
by a certified soil classifier recognized by the Illinois Soils Classifiers
Association or the American Registry Of Certified Professionals In Agronomy,
Crops, And Soils. United States department of agriculture (USDA) natural
resources conservation service soil classifiers may be available for periodic
quality control sessions conducted with all scientists available for the
performance of on site soil borings. USDA natural resources conservation
service soil scientist may be available to provide needed soils expertise to
the department and other county agencies in connection with the needs of this
chapter. Soil reports shall be provided in a form uniform with county needs and
requirements.
   B.   There shall be a minimum of three (3) soil borings per private sewage
disposal system site in the area where the private sewage disposal system is
intended to be installed. Additional soil borings may be required for accurate
and appropriate evaluation of a site where there is some concern about the
consistency of the soil materials.
   C.   Soil borings shall be dug to a minimum depth of five feet (5') with a
minimum width of two feet (2'), and one end of the pit shall be stepped or
sloped to permit adequate ingress and egress.
   D.   Soil borings shall be excavated at the perimeter of the expected
private sewage disposal system area to minimize damage to the natural soil
structure and potential disruptions of the soil distribution network that may
be caused by settling after installation of the system.
   E.   Soil borings shall not be made when frost depth is ten inches (10") or
greater.
   F.   Site characteristics to be described include zones of estimated
seasonal high ground water table, observed water table, depth to bedrock, frost
depth, USDA soil textural changes, USDA soil structural features of note,
consistence, location of fill soil, compaction and depth, soil coloration,
depth of mottling (depth to low chroma equal to or less than 2 and a value of 4
or more Munsell color chart), and estimated permeability at a depth twelve
inches (12") to thirty six inches (36"). A site location map showing the
location of the soil test sites shall be included with the soil report. The
subsurface seepage system should be sized using section
18-39, table I, "Soil Suitability Chart For On Site Sewage Disposal Design", of
this chapter.

18-39: REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBSURFACE SEEPAGE SYSTEMS UTILIZING FILL:
Subsurface seepage systems utilizing fill shall be designed with the following
criteria:
   A.   If fill is used on systems to maintain at least two feet (2')
separation between the bottom of the trench and the limiting layer, it may not
exceed eighteen inches (18") in depth. Fill soils may be used to cover a
private sewage disposal system provided no part of the system is located in the
fill and the material is at least equal to or better than the original soil or
meets the requirements in subsections B and C of this section.
   B.   Where less than twelve inches (12") of fill is to be placed over a
disposal field, the suitability of the fill materials shall be determined by a
soil classifier. Soils that are to be used for fill shall meet the following
criteria:
      1.   The fill shall conform to soils in design groups II, III, and IV as
identified in the private sewage disposal code 1996.
      2.   The fill shall be of a porous material that is not compacted or wet.
      3.   The fill shall be free of other nonsoil materials such as concrete,
brick or other extraneous material.
   C.   Where more than twelve inches (12") of fill is required, for previously
platted lots the suitability of the fill materials shall be determined by a
soil classifier.
      1.   The clay content shall be less than twenty five percent (25%).
      2.   Sand content shall be less than sixty five percent (65%).
      3.   Less than five percent (5%) of the content shall be greater than two
millimeter (2 mm) stones.
      4.   Organic matter shall be three percent (3%) or greater.
      5.   No clods greater than ten percent (10%) by volume or greater than
four inches (4") in size.
      6.   The fill shall be free of other nonsoil materials such as concrete,
brick or other extraneous material.
   D.   All of the following conditions shall be met for a private sewage
disposal system to be installed in fill:
      1.   Satisfactory original soil shall be at least four feet (4') above
bedrock.
      2.   A maximum of eighteen inches (18") of fill soil shall be used.
      3.   Fill shall not be placed on original soil with a slope greater than
ten percent (10%).
      4.   When adding fill to a depth of less than twelve inches (12"), the
fill may be added after the installation of the seepage field system. When fill
depth is from twelve (12) to eighteen inches (18"), the fill shall be placed
before installation of the seepage field.
      5.   The fill shall be placed at the site so that a minimum of compacting
occurs and the fill shall be allowed to settle undisturbed for a period of at
least twelve (12) months.
      6.   After the fill has been settled, a percolation test shall be
conducted.
   E.   Site preparation for use of fill soil:
      1.   Excess vegetation shall be cut and removed. The site shall be plowed
with a mold board plow seven (7) to eight inches (8") deep with the plowing
done parallel to the slope. Chisel plowing may be used in place of mold board.
Rototilling is prohibited.
      2.   Once the site is plowed, all vehicular traffic must be kept off the
site. The fill material can be deposited on the top with a long reach backhoe
or pushed on from the upslope side, using a track type tractor, keeping six
inches (6") of fill beneath the tracks. At no time shall ruts be made in the
plowed area. The fill shall be placed immediately after site preparation to
avoid the possibility of precipitation falling on the plowed area.
      3.   Traffic on the downslope side of the fill area shall be minimal to
reduce compaction. All work shall be performed from the ends and upslope side.
Compaction of the natural soil down slope will reduce the lateral movement of
the effluent.
      4.   The fill shall not be placed on frozen ground or when the soil is
wet. Moisture content of the soil is very important when filling. Site
preparation shall not take place when the soil is too wet and subject to
compaction. To check moisture content, take a soil sample from the plow layer
(7 to 8 inches) and roll it between the palms of the hands. If it rolls into a
ribbon, it is too wet to prepare. If it crumbles, site preparation can then
proceed.

who shall check them for conformity to the preliminary plan and the provisions
of this and other applicable ordinances. Within thirty (30) days after filing,
the appropriate officials shall notify the applicant as to the acceptability of
the improvement plans. Upon acceptability of the improvement plans and
conformance with the provisions of subsection E of this section, a
preconstruction meeting shall be scheduled.
   D.   Completion Of Land Improvements: Prior to the preconstruction meeting a
construction guarantee is posted in accordance with subsection G of this
section. Construction of all required improvements must be completed within two
(2) years from the date of final plat approval unless good cause can be shown
to the committee for granting an extension of time. A request for an extension
shall not halt the running of the two (2) year period. No extension shall be
granted unless adequate guarantee collateral has been received and approved by

final plat or prior to commencement of any development activity whichever shall
first occur, the owner or developer shall post and continuously maintain with
the plat officer a construction guarantee in the amount of one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the cost of the required improvements. The cost of each
improvement shall be itemized in a list prepared in a format specified by the
county (refer to appendix VIII) and signed and sealed by the design engineer on
his letterhead stationery and approved by the plat officer and the county
engineer. Such guarantee is to:
      1.   Assure the satisfactory installation of said improvements in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications and according to good
engineering and construction practices;
      2.   Assure the satisfactory completion of said improvements within the
prescribed time limits.
Such guarantee shall be in one of the following formats and the form, amount
and provider subject to approval by the plat officer:
         a.   Cash, certificate of deposit with or an escrow account at a
federally insured bank; or
         b.   An undertaking by owner and/or developer guaranteeing completion
of the land improvements remaining to be completed, as secured by an
irrevocable letter of credit or surety bond certifying that adequate funds are
and will be available at a sound and reputable banking or financial institution
authorized to do business in the state of Illinois. Such irrevocable letter of
credit or surety bond shall be in effect for a period of four (4) years from
the date of recording of the final plat, shall run in favor of the county and
shall indicate there are sufficient funds available for one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the estimated cost of all the land improvements remaining to
be completed, and that such funds are held for such purposes only and for no
other purposes. Such undertaking and irrevocable letter of credit or surety
bond shall be in a form to allow the county to procure the funds to complete
the land improvements if construction of said improvements is not completed in
accordance with the provisions hereof, and shall otherwise be in a form
acceptable to the county.
         c.   Other good and sufficient security as approved by the appropriate
legal authority of the county to guarantee the proper installation of land
improvements.
   H.   Construction Guarantee Reduction: A construction guarantee shall be
reduced only by authorization of the plat officer upon:
      1.   Application for payout by the owner and/or developer in amounts of
such that funds remaining will always equal one hundred twenty percent (120%)
of the value of the uncompleted work, as determined by the plat officer after
consultation with the county engineer and other staff. No more than ninety
percent (90%) of the construction guarantee shall be released prior to one year
after the satisfactory completion of the required improvements; or
      2.   The unsatisfactory installation of the required improvements. Where
the required improvements have not been installed in accordance with subsection
G of this section, the county may then declare the construction guarantee to be
in default and may draw from the guarantee amount for use in matters related to
ensuring the satisfactory construction of said improvements, including attorney
fees and court costs encumbered in the enforcement of the provisions of this
section. In the event of failure to complete the required improvements in the
required period, or any extension thereof, or to maintain in force a
performance guarantee as stated above, the committee may direct that no further
building permits be issued to the owner and/or developer for property in such
subdivision until acceptance or acknowledgment of completion by the committee
of the required improvements.
   I.   Release Of Construction Guarantee: The plat officer shall not release a
construction guarantee prior to the satisfactory installation of all required
improvements, as determined:
      1.   One year after the completion of all improvements required for the
approved final plat;
      2.   After the submission of the project engineer's certification that
the project installation has been observed in the field and completed in
substantial compliance with the plans and specifications and with all
applicable ordinances;
      3.   After the submission of one reproducible print and five (5) copies
of record drawings, in the required format including one digital copy, two (2)
of which shall be forwarded to the county engineer. The drawings shall be
prepared by the project engineer who shall show and certify as to the actual
location of all improvements, and shall clearly designate any and all changes
from the approved plans and specifications. The record drawings shall make
reference to at least two (2) permanent bench mark monuments, and at least one
reference monument for each bench mark, all on NGVD datum. The bench mark shall
be newly established within the subdivision for the purposes of establishing
base flood elevations and/or building elevations and finished grades on
individual lots after the subdivision improvements have been completed. (Refer
to appendix XII for certificate and stamp to appear on plans.);
      4.   After notification from the county engineer as to the acceptance of
all road and related drainage improvements by the township highway
commissioner; and
      5.   After the acceptance of all improvements.
   J.   Maintenance: The owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of all
improvements until the release of the construction guarantee. Where a
subdivision has been improved in phases, the applicant shall be responsible for
the proper functioning of drainage improvements for the entire subdivision
site. The applicant shall also be responsible for the following:
      1.   Snow Removal: The owner and/or developer shall be required to
provide for snow removal on all roads and sidewalks until the final acceptance
of said improvements.
      2.   Erosion Control: All exposed earth surfaces resulting from the
required improvements shall comply with the Kane County stormwater management
ordinance and be properly protected by riprap, sod or be seeded and mulched
with rapid growing grass or vegetation as soon as feasible to prevent erosion.
Erosion control structures shall be maintained until the exposed earth is
stabilized. At such time, the temporary structures shall be removed and the
area graded and stabilized prior to final acceptance.
      3.   Debris Removal: The owner and/or developer shall clean and maintain
or cause to be cleaned and maintained, all improvements until the final
acceptance of said improvements. The improvements shall be kept free from
debris, sediment deposits, trash and other extraneous material prior to
acceptance and at such other times during construction as the county may deem

tanks, culverts, storm sewers, etc. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-58: OFF SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
If it is determined that any existing infrastructure including, but not limited
to, water distribution systems, sanitary sewers or other wastewater treatment
facilities, storm sewers, subsurface drainage systems or other stormwater
management facilities, roads, and curbs and gutters, which may be situated
either in part or entirely off site, is inadequate to facilitate a proposed
subdivision when one hundred percent (100%) built out, then improvements to any
one or all of such facilities may be required. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-59: SUBDIVISION CLASSIFICATIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, there shall be two (2) classifications of
subdivisions: urban and country. The improvements which will be required will
be dependent on the type of subdivision as herein described. (Ord. 12-268, 10-
9-2012)
19-60 - 19-65: RESERVED:
DIVISION 2. LOTS AND BLOCKS
19-66: LOT ARRANGEMENT 1 :
The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable
difficulties, for reasons of topography, soils, flooding or other conditions,
in securing permits to build on all lots in compliance with the zoning
ordinance, chapter 18 of this code, and the sewage treatment and disposal
system rules and regulations. Subdivisions shall contain no leftover pieces,
corners, or remnants of lands. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
 
Notes
1 1. See chapter 25, "Zoning", of this code.
19-67: LOT LINES AND DIMENSIONS 1 :
   A.   All lots shall meet the minimum depth, width, and area requirements of
the applicable district in the zoning ordinance.
   B.   In single-family residence districts where lots are forty thousand
(40,000) square feet in area, or larger, individual water supply and septic
systems are permitted. Where a community water supply, but no community sewer
system, is available, the minimum lot area is thirty thousand (30,000) square
feet, and where community sewer, but no community water is available, the
minimum lot area is twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. Where both community
water supply and community sewer system is available, the minimum lot area is
ten thousand (10,000) square feet. In areas zoned multiple-family, business, or
other land uses which may require special water supply or sewage disposal, the
minimum lot areas must be sufficient to safely accommodate these special needs.
   C.   Depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and
industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off road service and
parking facilities required by the applicable district of the zoning ordinance.
   D.   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A proportion of
two and one-half to one (21/2:1) shall normally be considered as a desirable
maximum for lot widths of one hundred feet (100') or more. Side lot lines shall
be substantially at right angles or radial to road lines. Lots at right angles
to each other should be avoided wherever possible.
   E.   Corner lot for residential use shall have ten feet (10') of extra width
to permit full building setbacks on both roads as required by applicable
provisions of the zoning ordinance.
   F.   Lot widths shall be measured at the building setback line, and may be
reduced ten percent (10%) at the end of the cul-de-sac, providing the lot area
meets the requirements of the zoning ordinance. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
 
Notes
1 2. See chapter 25, "Zoning", of this code.
19-68: LOTS AFFECTED BY SURFACE WATERS:
No more than ten percent (10%) of the minimum lot area as defined in section
19-67 of this chapter shall include land within a drainage easement along a
waterway, intermittent stream, or other water body, or a watercourse
constructed to accommodate observed, computed, or anticipated water drainage
through and from the lot. Provided, however, if any lot shall contain at least
forty thousand (40,000) square feet in buildable area exclusive of any drainage
easement, then this provision shall not apply. Where a watercourse separates
the buildable area of a lot from the road by which it has access, provisions
shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure of design
approved by the county engineer. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-69: LOT DRAINAGE:
Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all
building sites and individual lot drainage shall be coordinated with the
general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage shall be designed so as
to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot to adjacent lots.
(Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-70: LOT ACCESS AND DOUBLE FRONTAGE:
   A.   Every lot shall front or abut on a dedicated public road. Lots with an
access only to existing private drives or roads shall be permitted only in
unusual circumstances, with the approval of the committee. The fronting of
residential lots on major roads and county highways is not to be permitted.
   B.   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and
orientation and where limited access highway, railroad right of way, major
road, county highway, or similar situation exists, in which case double
frontage lots are to be preferred, provided suitable screen planting contained
in a no access reservation along the property line and right of way is
provided. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-71: BLOCKS:
The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be such as are appropriate for the
locality and the type of development contemplated, but block length in
residential areas shall not exceed one thousand five hundred feet (1,500'), nor
have less than sufficient width to provide two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate
depth between road lines, except for blocks with one tier of lots which meet
the double frontage requirements of section 19-70 of this chapter. (Ord. 12-
268, 10-9-2012)
19-72: EASEMENTS AND LAND DEDICATIONS:
   A.   Utility Easements: Utility easements shall be provided at the rear of
all lots and along the side and front lot lines where required. On wooded
sites, utility easements shall be located so as to minimize environmental
damage. Utility easements shall be at least ten feet (10') wide, and normally
centered upon the rear or side lot lines. Evidence shall be furnished to the
plat officer that easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated on
the final plat or in the deeds have been reviewed by the individual utility
companies or organizations responsible for furnishing the services. The wording
of utility easements on the final plat shall be approved by the plat officer.
   B.   Drainage And Stormwater Management Facility Easements:
      1.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, or other body of water, appropriate dedications or
easements, with adequate width to accommodate observed, computed or anticipated
stormwater drainage through and from the subdivision, shall be made. The width
of the easement or dedication shall be dependent on the area of land drained by
the watercourse and shall allow access for construction and maintenance
equipment.
      2.   All permanent stormwater management facilities for a subdivision
shall be protected by easements or dedications for drainage and shall permit
ingress and egress for maintenance. All lot lines adjacent to unsubdivided
lands shall have a twenty foot (20') easement for drainage.
      3.   No construction of structures, dams, embankments or channels (except
as indicated on the improvement plans) and no planting of trees, shrubbery or
other vegetation, which hinder the flow of water or otherwise inhibit the
intended purposes, shall be allowed within any drainage or stormwater
management facility easement. In the event the area within such easements is
obstructed, reshaped, regraded or restricted for uses other than as intended or
as shown on the improvement plans, the county will cause to have any
alterations corrected at the expense of the party or parties causing said
obstruction, restriction, regrading or alteration.
      4.   Where possible drainage easements shall be separate and distinct
from utility easements.
      5.   Drainage and stormwater management facility easements shall be
adequately maintained so as to provide for removal of accumulation of
vegetation, silt, debris or other material which may interfere with the flow
characteristics of drainageways or the essential features of retention or
detention facilities. This long term maintenance shall be completed in
accordance with the Kane County stormwater management ordinance.
   C.   Landscaping And Conservation Easements:
      1.   Screen Planting Easement: A screen planting easement may be required
between residential and commercial or industrial lots, or along lot lines to
discourage the undesirable development of residential lots fronting on traffic
arteries. If such easement is to be used for public utilities, the easement
shall be of sufficient width to accommodate appropriate screen plantings
without interfering with utility service or maintenance.
      2.   Conservation Easement: A conservation easement shall be required to
protect unique areas such as wetlands, rivers, streams, creeks, and any other
unique areas. The designated easement area shall be protected from any land
disturbing activities such as the removal of vegetation, filling, grading and
excavating, and any other manmade activity that would reduce the quality of the
conservation area. The boundaries determined shall be by field investigation
and shall be delineated and identified as a conservation easement on the
preliminary plan and on the final plat. An additional fifty foot (50') buffer
zone may be required to allow a transitional zone between the area to be
protected and any land disturbing activity such as removal of vegetation,
filling, grading and excavating, and any other activity that would reduce the
quality of the conservation areas.
      3.   Restoration Of Site Flora Easement: Easements may be required to
protect areas designated for the restoration of site flora.
   D.   Temporary Turnaround Easements: Temporary turnaround easements shall be
reserved for road purposes until the extension of the road is publicly
dedicated. The temporary easement shall then be considered automatically
released for such use and purpose. The dimensions of such turnaround shall meet
the requirements for temporary "T" turnarounds as provided in division 3 of
this article.
   E.   Pedestrianway Easements: Easements or dedications shall be provided for
pedestrianways where deemed appropriate by the committee. Pedestrianway
easements shall be maintained to permit their continued use.
   F.   Land To Be Dedicated To A Governmental Body Or Open Space Organization:
The plat officer shall not execute or deliver any plat without satisfactory
provision for the dedications or conveyances of open space including, but not
limited to, an executed agreement for ownership and maintenance of such open
space. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)

A public road shall be provided for convenient access to all property and lots
within a subdivision. Private roads and easements of access shall not be
permitted except when approved by the committee and after consultation with the
county engineer and the township highway commissioner. All private roads shall
be built to county approved specifications and standards with township highway
commissioner inspection approval provided during construction. (Ord. 12-268,
10-9-2012)
19-86: PUBLICLY PLANNED ROADS:
Roads shall be laid out in conformity to road or highway plans officially
adopted by the county board or the Illinois division of highways. If the
subdivision lies within one and one-half (11/2) miles of the corporate limits
of a municipality, the roads shall also be in conformity with the road or
highway plan officially adopted by the corporate authority of that
municipality. Wherever such a planned road or highway runs through a proposed
subdivision, it shall be provided for in the place, and with the width
indicated, on said plan. However, no more than one hundred twenty foot (120')
right of way width dedication shall be required for any road. Any additional
right of way specified on said plan shall be reserved for circulation purposes
by easement provisions to be acquired at a later date by the public agency
involved. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-87: ALIGNMENT AND CONTINUATION:
Where roads are not a part of the official map or officially adopted road or
highway plans, the arrangement of the roads in a subdivision shall either
provide for the alignment and continuation or appropriate projection of
existing principal roads in surrounding areas, or conform to an approved plan
for the neighborhood which meets a particular situation where topography or
other conditions make continuation of or conformance to existing roads
impracticable. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-88: ROADWAY CLASSIFICATIONS 1 :
All existing and planned roads shall be classified according to the following:
   A.   Major roads shall be those whose primary purpose is to carry high
volumes of traffic, with trip lengths generally over one mile. All marked state
and federal routes, and those county and township roads and other roads so
designated by the county board shall be considered major roads. These should
provide continuous service at moderate speeds through an urban area and
moderate to high speed travel in rural areas.
Freeways and expressways are major roads with fully or partially controlled
access, permitting moderate to high speed travel. Access or modifications of
access to county roads designated by the county board as freeways may be
permitted only by approval of the county board's transportation committee.
   B.   Collector roads shall be those whose purpose is to collect and
distribute medium to low traffic volumes between major and local roads.
Collector roads should be interneighborhood roads and particularly related to
serving specific traffic generating facilities such as schools, churches,
commercial or employment areas, and other areas of greater traffic generation.
All county highways and some township roads shall be considered collector
roads.
   C.   Local roads shall be those whose primary purpose is to provide access
to abutting property. They should be laid out so as to discourage use by
through traffic. All roads other than major and collectors shall be considered
local roads.
   D.   Frontage roads shall be special types of local roads running
approximately parallel and adjacent to the right of way of a railroad, limited
access road, or county, state, federal, or interstate route, so as to provide
access to abutting property only on the side of the road opposite said right of
way. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)

diameter, with a throat right of way radius of seventy feet (70'). The paved
circle shall be centered in the right of way and have a paved circle of one
hundred twenty feet (120') diameter and a throat pavement radius of fifty feet
(50'). Proposal of a cul-de-sac longer than five hundred feet (500') shall
require special review by the plat officer and county engineer. Options to not
pave the inner area to provide a "T" turnaround in lieu of a cul-de-sac are
subject to individual review and approval by the township highway commissioner
and county engineer.
   B.   "T" Turnarounds: A "T" turnaround shall be installed at all temporarily
ended roads. The final plat shall provide for a temporary easement to
accommodate the installation and use of said "T" turnaround until such time as
the road extension is completed and accepted by the appropriate highway
authority. At such time the temporary turnaround easement shall be released.
The additional right of way required for "T" turnarounds shall be forty feet

driveway intersections, sized to eliminate flooding or ponding, but not less
than fifteen inches (15") in diameter, and with a minimum subgrade cover of six
inches (6"). The location, type and sizing of culverts is to be determined by
the county engineer or the township highway commissioner.
   D.   The following criteria shall be used in planning and designing the
groundwater drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity
for groundwater or nuisance flows in a pipe or tile in order to keep yards and
ditches from becoming wet in dry weather.
      1.   Design Methodologies: Groundwater or nuisance flow systems shall be
designed by using the information found in the University Of Illinois
cooperative extension service circular #1226, Illinois drainage guide for
sizing of drain tiles. Drainage coefficients for subsurface drains of one-half
inch (1/2") per day or less shall be used when designing groundwater drainage
systems for wet or perched water table soils in order to not increase base
flows in receiving streams.
      2.   Groundwater Drainage Systems: All septic system curtain drains and
all sump pumps shall be connected to a new groundwater (also called nuisance or
subsurface) drainage system. The new groundwater drainage system shall be
routed around stormwater storage basins. The new groundwater drainage systems
shall not drain into old existing agricultural drain tiles. Rather, they shall
be connected to an existing or proposed wet pond, wetland or stream, or
extended off site to a stream. All new groundwater drainage system pipes, both
on site and off site, shall be placed within a minimum ten foot (10') wide
drainage easement. No footing tiles shall be connected by gravity to a
groundwater drainage system. Groundwater drainage systems shall be kept
separated, in general, from storm sewer systems to avoid hydraulic surcharging
of the groundwater drainage system. However, groundwater systems may drain into
storm sewer systems or utilize the same pipe as the storm sewer system provided
all essential design criteria of a separate groundwater system can be met, and:
         a.   The storm sewer system drains to an on site wet pond, wetland or
stream.
         b.   The groundwater drainage system will not be hydraulically
surcharged by stormwater flows, including the prevention of hydraulic
overloading of sump pump services and septic system curtain drains. (Ord. 12-
268, 10-9-2012)
19-114: UNDERGROUND WIRING:
The owner or developer shall make arrangements for all lines for telephone,
electricity, television and other similar services distributed by wire or cable
to be placed underground entirely throughout the subdivided area. Such conduits
or cables shall be placed within easements or within public ways where
necessary, provided only that overhead lines may be permitted by the committee
where it is determined that overhead lines will not constitute a detriment to
the health, safety, general welfare, and character of the subdivision. All such
facilities placed in dedicated public ways or easements shall be planned so as
not to conflict with other underground utilities. Electrical transformers and
telephone junction boxes shall not be placed in any portion of a designated
drainage or stormwater control facility. All such facilities shall be
constructed in accordance with standards approved by the Illinois commerce
commission, and in conformance with the franchise of said utilities. (Ord. 12-

shall be determined by the scoring system defined in "Wild Plants And Natural
Areas Of Kane County" by Young or "Plants Of The Chicago Region" by Swink and
Wilhelm. All required landscaping shall be environmentally sound with plant
selection appropriate to sunlight exposure and existing climatic, edaphic, and
hydrological conditions. Where no existing native vegetation exists, the
developer shall be required to plant a minimum of two (2) native tree species
on each lot created appropriate to the aforegoing physical conditions
encountered. All plant material shall be of a size sufficient to withstand
external stresses likely to be encountered and shall be planted in a manner
consistent with standard horticultural practices. Disease prone species,
sterile clones and any plant with a negative rating in "Wild Plants And Natural
Areas Of Kane County" are not acceptable. Provision shall be made to assure the

DIVISION 2. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 1
 
Notes
1 1. See also chapter 25, article XII, "Planned Unit District", of this code.
19-136: DEFINITIONS:
A "planned unit development" is a tract or tracts of land which may include two
(2) or more principal uses that would otherwise require classification of the
tract into two (2) or more standard zoning districts and which is developed as
a unit. A planned unit development may also be a tract or tracts of land which
include varying residential lot sizes as a result of providing adequate soil
and other physical requirements for on site wastewater disposal systems
ensuring adequate protection of environmental and natural amenities; and
providing for the reservation of public or private open space areas. (Ord. 12-
268, 10-9-2012)
19-137: INTENT:
The planned unit development is a concept which encourages improved design in
the development of land. It is the intent of this division to provide flexible
land use and design regulations and performance criteria. This division
specifically encourages innovations in residential development so that the
growing demands for housing at economically reasonable prices can be met by
greater variety in type, design, and siting of dwellings and by the
conservation and more efficient use of land in such developments. (Ord. 12-268,
10-9-2012)
19-138: COMPLIANCE 1 :
A planned unit development shall conform to the comprehensive plan, the zoning
ordinance, the requirements as stated herein, all regulations pertaining to the
control of land development and to all other applicable rules, regulations,
specifications and standards. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
 
Notes
1 2. See chapter 25, "Zoning", of this code.
19-139: GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
A planned unit development (PUD) shall consist of such combination and
arrangement of elements as will:
   A.   Form a compatible and harmonious group or groups;
   B.   Be consistent with the policies and recommendations of the
comprehensive plan of the county;
   C.   Be suited to the capacity of existing and proposed community
facilities;
   D.   Be capable of a unitary design consistent with the protection of public
health, safety, and welfare in general; and
   E.   Not adversely affect the permissible uses of adjacent properties. (Ord.
12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-140: DESIGN TALENTS:
Professional talents of qualified land planners, licensed landscape architects,
Illinois licensed professional engineers, Illinois licensed professional land
surveyors, and other specialists deemed necessary shall be utilized in
different stages of the preparation necessary to effect a planned unit
development to assure developments of the quality desired by the county. (Ord.
12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-141: SITE:
The site for a planned unit development shall consist of a single parcel of
land or an integrated group of parcels. The site may include areas of land
which are topographically unsuitable for the erection of structures but which
may be incorporated into the development plan as an element of the open space
system. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-142: PROCEDURES AND APPROVAL PROCESS:
The detailed review procedures, submittal requirements and approval process for
a planned unit development shall be the same as those required in article II of
this chapter except where otherwise stated herein. The following items are for
clarifying the process or providing more detailed requirements:
   A.   Subsequent to completion of the concept plan stage, the applicant shall
prepare a detailed development plan. The submittal requirements and review
process for a development plan shall be the same as required for preliminary
plans in article II of this chapter. In addition, the development plan shall
convey by map, table or text the following:
      1.   Land development pattern showing relationships among physical
features, including:
         a.   Typical arrangements of buildings; community facilities,
landscape features and topography;
         b.   Density of land use to be allocated to parts of the development
site;
         c.   Circulation plan showing major, collector, and local roads;
         d.   Location and function of all common open space.
Except in the case of very large sites, the above information may usually be
included on one or two (2) map sheets.
      2.   Acreage allocated for open space, major types of housing and
nonresidential features. (May be conveyed in tabular form on the map sheet.)
      3.   Relation between the development and adjacent land in terms of uses,
physical features on the land, the areawide system facilities. (A separate map
at area scale is desirable for this information.)
      4.   Written provisions for the permanent maintenance of common or
privately owned community facilities shall be included in the development plan.
The development plan shall be submitted for review by the plat officer and the
committee. Action shall be contingent upon the following criteria:
         a.   Consistency with the general requirements for planned unit
development;
         b.   Fulfillment of the specific quantitative and qualitative
requirements for density, land use, and administrative features;
         c.   The satisfactory arrangement of features on the site as shown on
the development plans in terms of:
            (1)   Free flowing circulation pattern;
            (2)   Functional compatibility among land uses as arranged;
            (3)   Locational convenience of facilities and services for
residents.
   B.   Planned unit development zoning shall be required and considered
subsequent to the committee's action on the development plan. Consideration and
action by the county board on the planned unit development zoning petition
shall be necessary before the matter shall proceed further before the
committee. Granting of planned unit development zoning constitutes official
approval of the development plan and authorizes construction to begin, pending
approval of improvement plans and issuance of the necessary permits. Expiration
of the development plan shall be warranted in the event of failure to commence
construction as approved with an extension of time granted after the passing of
one year from the date of rezoning the site to a planned unit development
district. No authority for construction within the site shall be granted until
the plan is reapproved.
   C.   Subsequent to the approval of the planned unit development zoning
petition, the applicant shall file detailed plans for the construction of
proposed site improvements and obtain necessary permits in accordance with the
requirements for improvement plans in article II of this chapter; however,
detailed improvement plans for entire large scale projects need not be
submitted at one time. The project may be divided into sections, with
improvement plans and construction guarantee necessary only for each section
prior to its construction. Where sectioning is desired, the applicant shall be
required to identify sections for the entire site before any improvement plans
may be approved. At no time shall the overall density of completed sections
exceed the overall density limits for the entire project.
   D.   Final platting and recording of all lots shall be required prior to
transfer of ownership of any parcel in accordance with the requirements for
final plats in article II of this chapter. Written guarantees for the
maintenance of private roads or open space when permitted by the committee must
be accepted by the plat officer prior to the approval of a final plat. (Ord.
12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-143: VALIDITY AND ADJUSTMENTS:
   A.   Approval of a planned unit development plan shall be valid for a period
of not more than ten (10) years from the date of such approval. After the ten
(10) year period, the plan shall be subject to review by the committee for
possible adjustments in light of current conditions before granting extended
approval. Any adjustments as to time or requirements by the committee, after
review and recommendation by the plat officer, may be granted by the committee
provided that if the development contains five hundred (500) or more residents,
the developer shall notify property owners in accordance with subsection B1 or
B2 of this section, prior to the adjustment being acted upon by the committee.
   B.   At any time during the course of construction and operation of the
development, any request by an owner for adjustments regarding the approved
development plan shall be referred to the committee and will be considered as
follows:
      1.   "Minor adjustments" are proposed changes regarding setback
distances, the location of easements and the physical layout and design of lots
and parcels which do not increase the density of area or decrease the open
space of the area and do not affect more than ten percent (10%) of lots in the
phase or unit affected as indicated on the approved development plan. Adjacent
and adjoining property owners within two hundred fifty feet (250') to any area
proposed for a minor adjustment shall be given fifteen (15) days' written
notice of the proposed adjustment and the date, time and place of the committee
meeting at which they may comment on the proposed minor adjustment.
      2.   "Major adjustments" are all adjustments not contained in subsection
B1 of this section or not involving an extension of time. Major adjustments
must proceed in accordance with section 25-4-7 of this code. In addition to the
required distribution associated with the zoning code, a major adjustment shall
be distributed to those listed on the distribution list under subsection 19-34D
of this chapter, preliminary plan distribution. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-144: DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS:
The general design standards of article III of this chapter shall govern
planned unit developments. Variation from the standards or criteria imposed by
article III of this chapter may be granted by the committee at the development
plan stage if there is a finding that the needs of traffic, drainage,
pedestrian circulation, lot layout and other usage are adequately accommodated
by facilities or improvements of dimensions other than those required, but not
necessarily under the minimum. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
19-145: CONVEYANCE AND MAINTENANCE OF COMMON OPEN SPACE 1 :
   A.   All land shown on the development plan as common open space must be
conveyed under one of the following options:
      1.   It may be conveyed to a public agency (pending acceptance) which
will agree to maintain the common open space and any buildings, structures, or
improvements which have been placed on it;
      2.   It may be conveyed to trustees provided in an indenture establishing
an association or similar organization for the maintenance of the planned unit
development;
      3.   It may be retained and maintained by the developer.
   B.   If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, conveyance
or retention must be made subject to covenants to be approved by the committee
which restrict the common open space to the uses specified on the approved
development plan, and which provide for the maintenance of the common open
space in a manner which assures its continuing maintenance and use for its
intended purposes.
   C.   No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the
approved development plan submittals unless the approved development plan
submittals have been amended to permit that use under the Kane County zoning
ordinance. However, no change of the use authorized under the zoning ordinance
may be considered as a waiver of any of the covenants, limiting the use of
common open space areas, are expressly reserved.
   D.   If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one
of the following methods of enforcement must be provided:
      1.   The legal right to develop the common open space for the uses not
specified in the approved development plan must be conveyed to a public agency;
      2.   The restrictions governing the use, improvement, and maintenance of
the common open space must be stated as conditions to the conveyance or
retention of the common open space, the fee title to the common open space to
vest in a public agency in the event of substantial default in the stated
conditions.
   E.   If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, the
covenants governing the use, improvements, and maintenance of the common open
space may authorize a public agency to enforce their provisions.
   F.   Provisions shall be executed for conveyance and maintenance of open
space designated for each section on the land plan at the time of construction
within said section. (Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)

give the reasons therefor in writing to the applicant; and if the objections
can be corrected, the applicant may amend his application and resubmit it for
approval.
   B.   No license shall be issued for any trailer coach park which does not

of whether a license is issued for such trailer coach park for any prior
licensing year.

($10.00) for each ten (10) acres, or a fraction thereof, used to harbor trailer
coaches thereon shall accompany each application for a permit to alter such
trailer coach park. No application fee shall be required to accompany an
application for a permit to alter a park where such alteration involves only a
reduction to the number of trailer spaces to a number less than such park is
currently licensed for. Such change or changes shall comply with such safety
and sanitary code, building code, rules and regulations as are applicable
thereto.
   E.   Such a permit does not relieve the applicant from securing permits or

ordinances applicable thereto. No license to operate and maintain a park shall
be issued if such park is in violation of the zoning ordinance and such park
was not in existence at the time of the passage of such zoning ordinance. (Ord.

for each trailer coach space in the park. Any applicant for an original license
to operate a new trailer coach park constructed under a permit by the zoning
officer shall only be required to pay one-fourth (1/4) of the annual fee if
such park begins operating after January 31 and before May 1 of such licensing
year; or one-half (1/2) of the annual fee if such trailer coach park begins
operation after October 31 and before February 1 of such licensing year; or
three-fourths (3/4) of the annual fee if such park begins operation after July
31 and before November 1 of such licensing year; but shall be required to pay

certified check or United States money order in the amount of the license fee
only, and any license fee, or any part thereof, once paid to and accepted by
the zoning officer, shall not be refunded if the license is granted.
   C.   The zoning officer shall deposit all funds received under this chapter
with the county treasurer. (Ord. 68-25, § 6, 4-9-1968)

the zoning officer; however, the zoning officer shall first serve, or caused to
be served, upon the licensee, a written notice in which shall be specified the
way or ways in which such licensee has failed to comply with this chapter. Said
notice shall require the licensee to remove or abate such nuisance, unsanitary
or objectional condition specified in such notice within a reasonable time. If

   A.   Wells screened into the shallow sand and gravel aquifer are not to be
screened any more than a few feet into the top of the Maquoketa Shale.
   B.   Wells that will be open to the Maquoketa Shale and rely primarily on
that unit for water are required to extend the casing into the unit
sufficiently to prevent water from the overlying sands and gravel aquifers from
entering into the well.
   C.   Wells drilled into the Galena-Platteville and St. Peter units are not
allowed to be open to the Maquoketa Shale. Casing for Galena-Platteville or St.
Peter wells are required to extend all the way through the Maquoketa Shale
formation when drilling a deep well. (ord. 22-356, 10-11-2022)

Kane County, Illinois, adopted December 15, 1954, as amended from time to time.
25-4-3-5: CONDITIONS RESTRICTING CONSTRUCTION; CORRECTIONS:
No building or structure, except advertising signs as permitted herein, shall

flooding, bad drainage, adverse earth or rock formation or topography, or any
other feature likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the
future inhabitants of said land. Where such condition can be corrected or where
construction can be designed to overcome such condition, such correction or
construction shall be designed by an Illinois licensed professional engineer or
architect, qualified for such work, prior to issuance of permit. (Ord. 88-62,
5-10-1988; Ord. 12-268, 10-9-2012)
25-4-4: VARIANCES:
25-4-4-1: PURPOSE:
Whenever in a specific case, after an application for a permit has been made to
the zoning enforcing officer, an appeal is made to the zoning board that there
are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out
the strict letter of any regulations relating to the construction, alteration
or location of buildings or structures, the zoning board may determine and vary
its application in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such
regulations, upon such conditions as may be considered appropriate and in the
public interest, and in accordance with the rules herein set forth.
25-4-4-2: PUBLIC HEARING:
No variation shall be made except after a public hearing before the zoning
board of which there shall be at least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time
and place of such hearing published in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the township where property is located. If no newspaper is
published in such township, then such notice shall be published in a newspaper
of general circulation published in the county where such property is located.
Said notice shall contain the particular location for which the variation is
requested as well as a brief statement of what the proposed variation consists.
However, the zoning board may consider an appeal for and decline to grant a
variation without a duly advertised hearing upon seven (7) days' written notice
to petitioner.
25-4-4-3: STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES:
No variation shall be made unless the zoning board of appeals finds that there
is a practical difficulty or some particular hardship upon the property if the
regulations are applied, and shall further find that such variations will not:
   A.   Impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property;
   B.   Increase the hazard from fire and other dangers to adjacent property;
   C.   Diminish the value of adjacent land and buildings;
   D.   Increase the congestion or traffic hazards in the public streets and
highways; and
   E.   Otherwise impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and general
welfare.
25-4-4-4: DECISION OF THE ZONING BOARD:
The board of appeals shall reach its decision within thirty (30) days from the
date of the public hearing on the request for variance. Four (4) of the seven
(7) members of the board of appeals must concur in order to grant a variance.
If the variance is granted, the action of the zoning board in granting a
variation shall contain or be accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the
reason for making such variation.
25-4-4-5: PETITIONS FOR VARIATIONS OF TEN PERCENT OR LESS:
All petitions for variances which seek a variation of ten percent (10%) or less
of the requirements of this code regarding the location of structures or bulk
requirements shall be reviewed and decided upon by the Kane County zoning
enforcement officer without a hearing before the zoning board of appeals.
However, before such variation may be granted, a notice of the intent to grant
such variation shall be sent by certified mail to all adjoining landowners. If
any adjoining landowner files a written objection with the zoning enforcement
officer within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such notice, the variation
shall not be considered by the zoning enforcement officer under this
subsection, but shall be considered pursuant to section 25-4-4-2 of this
chapter. (Res. 91-52, 3-12-1991; Ord. 05-304, 9-13-2005)
25-4-5: APPEALS:
25-4-5-1: SCOPE OF APPEALS:
Any person aggrieved or any officer, department, board or bureau of the county
may appeal to the zoning board to review any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the enforcing officers or to interpret the regulations.
Such appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the
zoning board by general rule as set forth in section 25-4-2-4 of this chapter,
by filing with the enforcing officers from whom the appeal is taken and with
the zoning board, a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The
enforcing officer shall forthwith transmit to the zoning board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
25-4-5-2: STAY OF ANY ACTION:
An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the enforcing officer certifies to the zoning board, after the notice of
appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the zoning board, or by a court of
record on application, on notice to the enforcing officer and on due cause
shown.
25-4-5-3: NOTICE OF HEARING:
The zoning board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and
give due notice thereof to the parties and decide the same within a reasonable
time. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by
attorney. The zoning board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion
ought to be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all the powers of
the enforcing officer.
25-4-5-4: DECISION OF THE ZONING BOARD:
The board of appeals shall reach its decision within thirty (30) days from the
date of the public hearing on the appeal. The concurring vote of four (4)
members of the zoning board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination of the enforcing officer. (Ord. 05-304,

"map amendment" means an amendment to the zoning map which affects an
individual parcel or parcels of land. Amendments may be proposed by the county
board, the zoning board of appeals or by any person, firm, corporation, or
other legal entity having a freehold interest in the subject property, or a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, or a contractual interest
which may become a freehold interest and which is specifically enforceable.
Proposed amendments shall be directed to the zoning board of appeals for
consideration and report to the county board.
25-4-7-2: PUBLIC HEARING:
No amendment to this ordinance shall be made without a hearing before the
zoning board of appeals. At least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time and
place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation

other county building with more adequate facilities for such hearings. Hearings
on map amendments shall be held in the township or road district affected by
the terms of such proposed amendment or in the courthouse, or other county
building with more adequate facilities for such hearings. Provided, that if the
owner of any property affected by such proposed map amendment so requests in
writing, such hearing shall be held in the township or road district affected
by the terms of such proposed amendment. Within thirty (30) days after the
final hearing, the zoning board shall file a report with the county board.
25-4-7-3: ACTION BY THE COUNTY BOARD:
   A.   Text Amendments: Text amendments may be passed at a county board
meeting by a simple majority of the elected county board members, unless:
      1.   Written protests against the proposed text amendment are signed by
five percent (5%) of the landowners of the county, or
      2.   A written protest by resolution of the corporate authorities of a
zoned municipality is filed with the county clerk, or
      3.   In the case of a text amendment affecting an unincorporated area of
a township having a plan commission, written objections are submitted by the
township board of trustees to the county board within thirty (30) days after
the hearing before the zoning board of appeals,
in which case such amendments shall not be passed except by the favorable vote
of three-fourths (3/4) of all members of the county board.
   B.   Map Amendments: Map amendments may be passed at a county board meeting
by a simple majority of the elected county board members, except that in case
of written protest against any proposed map amendment that is either:
      1.   Signed by the owner or owners of at least twenty percent (20%) of
the perimeter of the land to be rezoned, or
      2.   Signed by the owner or owners of land immediately touching, or
immediately across a street, alley, or public right of way from at least twenty
percent (20%) of the perimeter of the land to be rezoned, or
      3.   In cases where the land affected lies within one and one-half (11/2)
miles of the limits of a zoned municipality, by resolution of the corporate
authorities of the zoned municipality with limits nearest adjacent, filed with
the county clerk, or
      4.   In the case of a map amendment affecting an unincorporated area of a
township having a plan commission, written objections are submitted by the
township board of trustees to the county board within thirty (30) days after
the hearing before the zoning board of appeals.
Such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of three-
fourths (3/4) of all the members of the county board.
   C.   Written Protests: The original copy of a written protest must be filed
with the Kane County clerk not later than the Friday preceding the county board

protestors on the applicant for the proposed amendment and a copy upon the
applicant's attorney, if any, by certified mail at the address of such
applicant and attorney shown in the application for the proposed amendment.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a map amendment is
proposed solely to correct an error made by the county as a result of a
comprehensive rezoning by the county, the map amendments may be passed at a
county board meeting by a simple majority of the elected board.
25-4-7-4: OPTIONAL REVOCATION:
In the case of property zoned by the county board of the county but not used
within one year from date of said zoning, for purposes permitted in
classification to which said property has been zoned, or, if the use of said
property has been discontinued for a continuous period of three (3) years, the
zoning board of appeals shall have the power to institute proceedings, on its
own motion, to consider the rezoning of said property to another
classification. (Ord. 78-79, §§ 3, 4, 6-13-1978; Ord. 79-229, § 1, 12-11-1979;
Ord. 82-66, 5-11-1982; Ord. 92-187, 9-8-1992; Ord. 97-214, 8-12-1997; Ord. 97-
240, 9-9-1997; Ord. 02-81, 3-12-2002)
25-4-8: SPECIAL USES:
25-4-8-1: PURPOSE:
The development and execution of this ordinance is based upon the division of
the county into districts within which districts the use of land and buildings,
and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land
are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are certain
uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use in the particular location.
To provide for the location of special classes of uses which are deemed
desirable for the public welfare within a given district or districts, but
which are potentially incompatible with typical uses herein permitted within
them, a classification of "special uses" is hereby established.
25-4-8-2: PUBLIC HEARING:
Uses as hereinafter enumerated, which may be proposed for classification as
"special uses", shall be considered at a public hearing before the zoning
board, and its report of findings of fact and recommendations shall be made to
the county board following the public hearing; provided, that the county zoning
board, in its report of findings of facts and recommendations to the county
board, shall not recommend a special use unless the zoning board shall find:
   A.   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be unreasonably detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety,
morals, comfort or general welfare;
   B.   That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of
other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood;
   C.   That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district;
   D.   That adequate utility, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
   E.   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress
and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets
and roads;
   F.   That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the county board pursuant to
the recommendations of the zoning board of appeals.
25-4-8-3: CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES:
Prior to the granting of any special use, the zoning board may recommend and
the county board shall stipulate such conditions and restrictions, upon the
establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special
use as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and
welfare. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the county board shall
require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being and will be complied
with.
It shall be required that a detailed plat of all improvements (site plan) shall
be submitted to the zoning board of appeals for approval or amendment at the
public hearing. Such plat, when approved by the county board, shall become a
part of this ordinance and development of the site shall be in accordance with
said plat. Minor variations in the development of the approved plat may be
authorized by the development committee.
25-4-8-4: EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A SPECIAL USE:
No application for a special use, which has been denied wholly or in part by
the county board, shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date
of said order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions found to be valid by the zoning board or county board.
25-4-8-5: REVOCATION:
In any case where a special use has not been established (substantially under
way) within one year from the date of granting thereof, then, without further
action by the county board, the special use or authorization thereof shall be
null and void, unless in the opinion of the zoning enforcing officer,
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee indicate that establishment
of the use has been impossible.
If the special use has been established and subsequently discontinued, the
zoning board of appeals shall have the power to institute proceedings on its
own motion to consider revocation of said special use.
25-4-8-6: ACTION BY THE COUNTY BOARD:
   A.   A special use may be passed at a county board meeting by a simple
majority of the elected county board members. (Ord. 76-29, 3-9-1976; Ord. 82-
66, 5-11-1982; Ord. 97-240, 9-9-1997; Ord. 02-81, 3-12-2002; Ord. 05-304, 9-13-

uncorrected constitutes a separate offense.
25-4-10-2: ENFORCEMENT:
In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land
is used in violation of this ordinance, the proper authorities of the county,
or any person, the value or use of whose property is or may be affected by such
violation, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action
or proceedings in the circuit court:

As required by statute, the type or location of any poles, towers, wires,
cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or any similar distributing equipment of a
public utility are exempt from the requirements of this ordinance with the
following exception: 55 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5-12001.1 gives counties
the authority to regulate certain specified facilities of a telecommunications
carrier. A "telecommunications carrier" is defined in the public utilities act
as of January 1, 1997. A "facility" means that part of the signal distribution
system used or operated by a telecommunications carrier under a license from
the FCC consisting of a combination of improvements and equipment including: a)
one or more antennas; b) a supporting structure (tower) and the hardware by
which antennas are attached; c) equipment housing; and d) ancillary equipment
such as signal transmission cables and miscellaneous hardware.
   A.   The following restrictions shall apply to a facility of a
telecommunications carrier unless a variance is obtained in accordance with
section 25-4-4 of this chapter:
      1.   Minimum Lot Size: A facility is not permitted in residentially zoned
lots that are less than two (2) acres in size.
      2.   Height:
         a.   Residential Zoned District: The height of the facility shall not
exceed seventy five feet (75').
         b.   Nonresidential Zoned District: The height of the facility shall

      3.   Setbacks:
         a.   Residential Zoning District: The setback distance to the nearest
residentially zoned lot shall be at least fifty percent (50%) of the height of
the tower.
         b.   Nonresidential Zoning District: The setback distance to the
nearest principal residential building shall be at least equal to the height of
the tower.
         c.   Any Zoning District: The setback distance of a facility shall be
at least ten feet (10') to the side and rear lot lines, thirty five feet (35')
to the road right of way line, and fifty feet (50') to any limited access
highway right of way line.
   B.   In designing a facility, a telecommunications carrier shall comply with
the following guidelines:
      1.   No building or tower that is part of a facility shall encroach onto
any recorded easement prohibiting the encroachment unless the grantees of the
easement have given their approval.

         h.   The Applicant shall agree that the obligations and liabilities
under a Special Use Permit shall be binding upon the Applicant (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes its successors-in-interest and assignees) and the
Operator. The Applicant further shall agree that the sale, assignment in fact
or at law, or other transfer of the Applicant's financial interest in the
Commercial Solar Energy Facility shall in no way effect or change the
Applicant's obligation to continue to comply with the terms, covenants and
obligations of a Special Use Permit unless such successor-in-interest or
assignee agrees to assume all obligations of the Special Use Permit, including
but not limited to the decommissioning obligations associated with the
Commercial Solar Energy Facility.
         i.   The County and its authorized representatives have the right of
entry onto the Commercial Solar Energy Facility premises for the purpose of

or failure to comply with any law or regulation shall be a default and shall be
grounds for revocation of the Special Use Permit by the County Board.
      2.   Prior to implementation of the applicable County procedures for the
resolution of default(s), the County Board must first provide written notice to
the Applicant and Operator, setting forth the alleged default(s) and provide an
opportunity for the Applicant or the Operator to cure the default(s) within a
thirty (30) calendar day period from the date of the notice. Should the
Applicant commence the cure within that 30-day cure period, and diligently
pursues a cure, then the Applicant shall receive an additional sixty (60) days
to continue to pursue the cure before the County pursues procedures for the
resolution of default. If the default relates to a life safety issue or
interference with local, government public safety (police, fire, emergency
medical services, emergency management services, 911 dispatch) communications,
the Applicant or the Operator shall take all necessary and available commercial
measures to immediately cure the default. If the Applicant or Operator cannot
cure the default(s) or resolve the alleged default(s) within the cure period,
then applicable County ordinance provisions addressing the resolution of such
default(s) shall govern.

ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT Section 25-4-8: Special Uses.
   L.   Hearing Facilitator: The County may engage the services of a hearing
facilitator. The hearing facilitator shall be an independent contractor who
shall conduct a hearing in accordance with all applicable rules of the board
and the county but has no adjudicatory responsibility other than ruling on
requests for continuances, procedural matters, admissibility of evidence and

State of Illinois. The Applicant shall reimburse the county for the fees and
costs charged by the facilitator.
   M.   Hearing Factors: The County Board may approve a Commercial Solar Energy
Facility Special Use Permit application, if it finds the evidence complies with
state and federal law and regulations, and with the standards of this zoning
code including the factors listed in ARTICLE IV. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Section 25-4-8: Special Uses.
      1.   Special Use Permit Conditions and Restrictions. The County Board may
stipulate conditions, guarantees and restrictions, upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance, and operation of the Commercial Solar
Energy Facility Project as are deemed necessary for the protection of the
public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements of
this division.
      2.   Revocation.
         a.   In any case where a Special Use has been approved for a
Commercial Solar Energy Facility Project, the Applicant shall apply for a
Commercial Solar Energy Facility Building Permit and a Stormwater Permit from
the County and all other permits required by other government or regulatory
agencies to commence construction, and commence and actively pursue
construction of the Project within thirty-six (36) months from the date of the
granting of the Special Use. If the Applicant fails to apply for a Commercial
Solar Energy Facility Building Permit and a Stormwater Permit from the County
and all other permits required by other government or regulatory agencies prior
to construction and/or fails to commence and actively pursue construction of
the Project within the thirty-six (36) month period, then without further
action by the County Board, the Special Use authorizing the construction and
operation of the Commercial Solar Energy Facility Project shall be
automatically revoked and void. Upon written request supported by evidence that
the Applicant has diligently pursued issuance of all necessary government and
regulatory permits for the Project required to commence construction and that
any delay in commencement of construction of the Project is due to conditions
out of his/her/its control, the County Board, in its sole discretion, may
extend the above thirty-six (36) month period by passage of an ordinance that
amends the Special Use.
         b.   The Special Use shall be subject to revocation if the Applicant
dissolves or ceases to do business, abandons the Commercial Solar Energy
Facility Project or the Commercial Solar Energy Facility ceases to operate for
more than twelve (12) consecutive months for any reason.
         c.   Subject to the provisions of Article XI (Remedies), a Special Use
may be revoked by the County Board if the Commercial Solar Energy Facility
Project is not constructed, installed and/or operated in substantial
conformance with the County-approved Project plans, the regulations of this
division and the stipulated Special Use conditions and restrictions.
      3.   Transferability; Owner or Commercial Solar Energy Facility
Permittee. The Applicant shall provide written notification to the County Board
at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in ownership of a Commercial
Solar Energy Facility. The phrase "change in ownership of a Commercial Solar
Energy Facility" includes any kind of assignment, sale; lease, transfer or
other conveyance of ownership or operating control of the Applicant, the
Commercial Solar Energy Facility or any portion thereof. The Applicant or
successors-in-interest or assignees of the Special Use Permit, as applicable,
shall remain liable for compliance with all conditions, restrictions, and
obligations contained in the Special Use, the provisions of this section and
applicable County, state, and federal laws.
      4.   Modification. Any modification of a Commercial Solar Energy Facility
that alters or changes the essential character or operation of the Commercial
Solar Energy Facility in a way not intended at the time the Special Use was
granted, or as subsequently amended, shall require a new Special Use. The
Applicant or authorized representative, shall apply for an amended Special Use
prior to any modification of the Commercial Solar Energy Facility.
      5.   Special Use Effective Date: The Special Use shall become effective
upon approval of the ordinance by the County Board.
   N.   Interpretation: The provisions of these regulations shall be held to

intended to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any manner interfere with existing
regulations or laws of the Kane County nor conflict with any statutes of the
State of Illinois.
   O.   Severability: If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase or part of this
division is for any reason held invalid by any court or competent jurisdiction,
such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of
these regulations. (Ord. 23-178, 5-9-2023)

25-5-10-1: CONTINUED CONFORMITY WITH BULK REGULATIONS:
The maintenance of yards and other open space and minimum lot area legally
required for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such
building or of the property on which it is located, as long as the building is
in existence. In the event of a reduction of the size of a parcel due to the
sale of a portion of the property to a government entity for public benefit,
which results in either a loss of a grandfathered status, a size smaller than
the minimum required in the parcel's current zoning district or a parcel
smaller than was approved in the parcel's subdivision, a rezoning would be
required. The zoning enforcing officer shall have the discretion to determine
that in the event an existing home was damaged resulting in a loss more than
fifty percent (50%) of its market value and prior to any rezoning being
granted, that a permit to rebuild could be obtained, subject to all current and
applicable regulations. Rezoning of the parcel would be encouraged, with the
county waiving the rezoning application fee. Furthermore, no legally required
yards, other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to any building shall,
by virtue of change of ownership or for any other reason, be used to satisfy
yard, other open space, or minimum lot area requirements for any other
building.
25-5-10-2: DIVISION OF ZONING LOTS:
No lot shall hereafter be divided into two (2) or more lots and no portion of
any lot shall be sold, unless all lots resulting from each such division or

25-6-1: PURPOSE:
This ordinance establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate
area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is
necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those
nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses which substantially and adversely
affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in the
district not be permitted to continue without restriction.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming
buildings, structures, and uses and to specify those circumstances and
conditions under which those nonconforming buildings, structures, and uses
shall be permitted to continue.
25-6-2: AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES:
Any nonconforming building, structure, or use which existed lawfully at the
time of the adoption of this ordinance and which remains nonconforming, and any
such building, structure, or use which shall become nonconforming upon the
adoption of this ordinance, or of any subsequent amendments thereto, may be
continued subject to the regulations which follow.
25-6-3: RESTRICTIONS ON NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES, AND USES:
Any lawfully existing building or structure which does not conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located may be continued, subject to
the provisions of this section 25-6-3.

So long as a building, structure, advertising sign, or business sign is used or
is eligible for use in a nonconforming manner, only ordinary repairs and
maintenance, including replacement of roof covering and veneering of outer
walls, shall be permitted. In no case shall such repairs include structural
alterations, or other work which will extend appreciably the normal life of the
building, structure, advertising sign, or business sign.
For the purpose of this section, repairs shall include the replacement of
storage tanks where the safety of operation of the installation requires such
replacement, and other replacements of, or substitutions for, machinery or
equipment not involving structural alterations to the building or structure,
except as hereinabove provided.
25-6-3-2: RELOCATION OF BUILDING OR STRUCTURE:
No building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
location on the same or any other lot unless every portion of such building or
structure which is moved, and the use thereof, is made to conform to all of the
regulations of the district in which it is to be located.
25-6-3-3: RESTORATION OF DAMAGED BUILDING OR STRUCTURE:
Any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use which may be destroyed
or damaged by fire or otherwise which requires reconstruction or repairs which
are valued at fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value of the building
before it was damaged or replaced, shall not be repaired or rebuilt, and no
building or structure shall be hereafter erected and used upon any land devoted
to a nonconforming use, except in conformity with the regulations of this
ordinance.
25-6-3-4: DISCONTINUANCE OF A NONCONFORMING USE:
If the nonconforming use of a building, structure, or premises is discontinued
for a continuous period of six (6) months, it shall not be renewed, and any
subsequent use of the buildings, structure, or premises shall conform to the
use regulations of the district in which such building, structure, or premises
is located.
25-6-3-5: EXPANSION OF NONCONFORMING USE:
   A.   Building Or Structure: A nonconforming use occupying a part of a
building or structure may be extended only throughout that part of the building
or structure originally designed for such use, but in no case shall an addition
be made which will provide for an expansion of the nonconforming use. A use
customarily incidental to a residence shall not expand beyond an area that is
clearly incidental to the amount used for residence. A nonconforming use of
land shall not be expanded beyond the area actually so used at the time of the
passage of this ordinance, or at the time, of a later amendment creating the
nonconformity.
   B.   Land: The nonconforming use of land, not involving a building or
structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is
incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be expanded
or extended beyond the area it occupies.
25-6-3-6: CHANGE OF NONCONFORMING USE:
   A.   Building Or Structure: A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or higher classification, provided the provisions
of subsection B of this section relating to expansion are complied with, or

or dissolution, or passage of an ordinance of disconnection, as the case may
be, such territory shall be zoned and the zoning map of the county shall be
amended to reflect the zoning classification, including as applicable, any
special uses that applied to the disconnected territory or to the territory of
the dissolved municipality immediately prior to the disconnection or
dissolution, unless the county zoning classification or special uses applicable
immediately prior to the incorporation are more restrictive than the
municipally approved land use, in which case the more restrictive provision
shall apply. Such zoning shall not preclude any party from applying for any
further zoning relief or amendment subject to the other provisions of this
chapter. This amendatory ordinance shall apply to any property disconnected
after December 1, 2007, and to any property incorporated into a municipality

site.
25-12-1-1: APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS:
The regular provisions of this ordinance shall govern with respect to planned
unit development except as expressly indicated from time to time in this
section.
The PUD district may be used for a planned unit development wherein individual

planning commission, application shall be made to the Kane County zoning board
of appeals for rezoning to PUD district for the area included within said plan.
25-12-1-3: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL:
Approval of a planned unit development plan shall be made only on the condition
that the entire site be under the legal control of the applicant who shall be
the owner of record.

granting PUD classification to the site and shall serve as the land use
regulation within the development.
Upon the passage of said ordinance granting PUD classification, final platting,
subdividing or further rezoning shall not be necessary within the planned unit
to complete the development of the unit in accordance with the approved planned
unit plan.
Prior to any conveyance of any part of the planned unit less than the whole,
the owner shall subdivide the area in compliance with the provisions of the
Illinois plat act, chapter 109 and shall further comply with the provisions of
the subdivision regulations of Kane County.
In the event that any conveyance or transfer is made by whatever nature or

25-14-1-7: Specific Requirements
25-14-1: PURPOSE:
Motor vehicle parking space shall be provided off the street or highway right
of way for each housekeeping unit in residential uses hereafter established,
and, in case of other uses hereafter established or expanded for employees, for
patrons or customers not served in their motor vehicles, and for customers
served in their motor vehicles, in such proportion as to assure free and
uninterrupted movement of traffic on the public streets or highways.
25-14-1-1: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Location: All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses
erected or established after the effective date of this ordinance shall be
located on the same zoning lot within one hundred feet (100') of the building
or use served, except that parking spaces to serve business or industrial
buildings or uses may be located within five hundred feet (500') of such use if
said spaces are located in a business or industrial district.
Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of this ordinance which are
subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the provision of parking
spaces under this ordinance, may be served by parking facilities located on
land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located,
provided such facilities are within five hundred feet (500') walking distance
of a main entrance to the use served. Owners of property, nonconforming as to
parking, who elect to provide parking and become conforming may locate such
parking on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use is
located, as allowed in this section.
   B.   Control Of Off Site Parking Facilities: In cases where parking
facilities are permitted on land other than the zoning lot on which the
building or use served is located, such facilities shall be in the same
possession as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are accessory. Such possession may be either by deed or long
term lease, the term of such lease to be determined by the board of appeals;
and such deed or lease shall be filed with the enforcing officer. The deed or
lease shall require such owner or his or her heirs and assigns to maintain the
required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served or of
the deed or lease, whichever shall terminate sooner.
   C.   Size: Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off street
parking space shall be at least nine feet (9') in width and at least eighteen
feet (18') in length, exclusive of access or drives or aisles, ramps, columns,
or office or work areas. Each space shall have a vertical clearance of at least
seven feet and one-half inch (7'1/2"). For parallel parking, the length of the
parking space shall be increased to twenty two feet (22'). Required handicapped
spaces shall be at least sixteen feet (16') in width in accordance with the
Illinois accessibility code standards.
   D.   Access: Each required off street parking space shall open directly upon
an aisle or driveway at least twenty four feet (24') wide for ninety degree
(90°) parking. Angular and parallel parking designs may allow a narrower aisle
width in accordance with nationally recognized design standards. All off street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movement. In any event, all driveways shall conform to all applicable driveway
specifications adopted by Kane County.
   E.   Collective Provision: Off street parking facilities for separate uses
may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not
less than the sum of the separate requirements governing location of accessory
parking spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no
parking space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than
one use, unless otherwise authorized by the board of appeals.
   F.   Computation: When determination of the number of off street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of less than one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, while a fraction
of one-half (1/2) or more, shall be counted as one parking space. Parking
spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of
employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one time.
   G.   Utilization: Required accessory off street parking facilities provided
for uses listed in section 25-14-1-7 of this chapter shall be determined for
parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees of such
uses.

   C.   Yards And Screening Adjoining Streets: With the exception of single-
family and two-family dwellings, off street parking spaces and access drives
shall not be located within a twenty foot (20') required yard adjoining a
public road right of way, except that an access drive generally perpendicular
to such right of way may traverse such yard. Screening shall be provided within
such yard, by means of landscaping and/or earth berms, so as to screen a
minimum of fifty percent (50%), measured horizontally, of the parking lot
adjoining said yard, as viewed from the public street. Except, within one
hundred feet (100') of the centerline of any intersecting road, street or
railroad at grade, no screening may be over three feet (3') in height so as not
to interfere with the site distance at the intersection.
   D.   Parking Adjacent To Residential Districts: Open off street parking
spaces and access drives adjoining a lot zoned for a residential use shall be
separated from such lot by a yard not less than five feet (5') in depth.
Screening consisting of earth berms, landscaping, and/or fencing shall be
provided and maintained so as to protect the privacy of adjoining residential
lots. Such screening shall be a minimum of five feet (5') in height above the
adjacent parking lot pavement grade.
   E.   General Landscaping Requirement: A minimum of ten percent (10%) of a

the natural beauty and aesthetic values, in the affected areas of the county.
25-15-1-1: MINING OPERATION LICENSE REQUIRED:
   A.   No person, firm or corporation shall hereafter engage in the mining of
topsoil, earth, clay, gravel, sand, stone or other minerals on any land within
the county of Kane, located outside the boundaries of any city, village or
incorporated town without first obtaining from the county a mining operations
license in such form and in such manner as shall hereinafter be provided.
   B.   No mining operations license shall be issued or be renewed, pursuant to
this ordinance unless the mining proposed to be conducted is a permitted use of
the applicable land under the provisions of the county zoning ordinance, as
amended.
25-15-1-2: APPLICATION FOR LICENSE:
   A.   Any person, firm or corporation desiring to commence the mining and
processing of topsoil, earth, clay, gravel, sand, stone or other minerals shall

described. Such application shall be accompanied by the following:
      1.   A bond meeting the requirements hereinafter set forth in this
ordinance.
      2.   A detailed map of the land drawn at a scale of one inch equals one
hundred feet (1":100') showing at least the following specifics:
         a.   Existing topographical features at two foot (2') contour
intervals, up to and including seven percent (7%) grade. Greater than seven
percent (7%) grade would require five foot (5') contours.
         b.   Location of watercourses and drainage systems.
         c.   Outline of area to be excavated.
         d.   The proposed location of sorting, grading, crushing, recycling

shall specify progress and completion dates of the reclamation and landscape
plan; provided, however, the reclamation is to be completed prior to the
expiration of three (3) years after the termination of the mining operation on
the land. In the event the operator and the county shall mutually determine
that characteristics of the area concerned have been found to be present during
the conduct of mining, changes may be made in the original reclamation and
landscape plan by mutual consent of the operator and the development committee
of the county board, which change shall preserve, as substantially as possible,
the original reclamation and landscape plan, and shall also provide for the
previously unknown variables. Contours shall conform to requirements of
development proposed, but not less than required for existing original
topography.

   A.   Each license issued hereunder shall be effective for a period of five
(5) years from and after the date of the issuance thereof, provided the
requirements of operation and reclamation, as are set forth under the operators
permit and application, shall be met. An examination of the premises shall be
made by the zoning enforcement officer of the county at intervals of not more
than each six (6) months during the term of operation.
   B.   Each license shall be renewable for successive five (5) year terms upon
written application therefor to the zoning enforcing officer, accompanied by a

time, and in compliance with and furtherance of the approved reclamation plan
for the affected land.
      2.   Clearing of the mining site shall include the moving of existing
trees and shrubs to such locations as will provide screening as hereinafter
provided whenever possible or as will conform to the plan for ultimate use of
the property as shown on the reclamation plan to be submitted.
      3.   Maximum depth of excavation shall not be below existing groundwater,
except in such cases where the reclamation plan indicates that a lake or lakes
will be part of the final use of the land or where such plan indicates that
adequate fill from overburden is to be used to refill such excavation for
conformance to the approved reclamation plan.
      4.   Adequate planting including native species and/or fencing shall be
provided along all public roads adjacent to the property involved, sufficient
to screen the operation from public view, as shown on approved reclamation and
landscape plan and as approved by the county board in granting a special use.
      5.   Not more than one entrance and one exit from a highway or road shall
be provided to the area of operation. Such entrance shall be subject to
approval by the department of highways having jurisdiction and shall,
preferably be located along a secondary road, and shall be located as to avoid
the routing of vehicles to and from the mining operation over streets that
primarily serve abutting residential development. If required, by the highway
department having jurisdiction, acceleration and deceleration strips shall be
provided on either side of such entrance and exit, of not less than one hundred
feet (100') in length each, and shall be paved of such material as shall be
required by the highway department having jurisdiction. Furthermore, a paved
road from the entrance and exit, a distance not less than three hundred feet
(300') from the right of way line into the area of operation shall be provided
in order to minimize the deposit of dirt and gravel from trucks onto the public
highway. Such pavement shall be in accordance with the specifications of the
county highway department. Entrances and exits shall be provided with the gates
to be securely locked during hours of inoperation.
      6.   Trucks used in hauling materials from the site of excavation shall
be loaded in such a manner as to prevent spillage onto the public highway.
Hours of arrival and departure of transport vehicles shall be from six o'clock

rest of the year the arrival and departure of transport vehicles shall be
restricted to six o'clock (6:00) A.M. to six o'clock (6:00) P.M. Hours may be
extended during a public emergency during which sand, gravel or limestone is
needed and upon the order of the county sheriff, the county engineer, or the
director of the county development department. The county board member
representing the district in which the mining operation is located shall be
notified as soon as permission is granted for extended hours of operation.
      7.   Overburden shall not be removed in excess of the area to be mined
within one year. Development toward final plan shall be carried on as
excavation progresses. Where ground cover or other planting is indicated on
approved plan, such planting shall be made in areas where excavation is
completed and land is not being used for material storage before further
overburden is removed and in order to ensure development as operations proceed.
      8.   Mining operations, not including maintenance of equipment used in
the mining operation shall be conducted only during the hours from six o'clock
(6:00) A.M. to six o'clock (6:00) P.M., except during a public emergency during
which sand and gravel is needed and upon order of the county sheriff, the

preserved, maintained, and supplemented for the depth of the required roadside
setback.
      13.   Upon the completion of operations, the land shall be left in a
condition so that sufficient drainage is provided in order to prevent water
pockets or undue erosion with all grading and drainage such that natural
stormwater leaves the entire property at the original, natural, drainage points
and that the area drainage to any one such point is not increased. In the event
the reclamation plan shall provide for the permanent establishment of a lake,
the grading and drainage may be altered, but not in such a manner as to cause
damage or inconvenience to surrounding or abutting properties.
      14.   Graded or backfilled areas or banks in the cases of excavations
made to water producing depth shall be covered with topsoil to a minimum depth
of six inches (6"). Such topsoil shall have a minimum of twenty five percent
(25%) organic material except that no greater depth of topsoil or percentage of
organic material shall be required than originally existing on property prior
to the commencement of operation.
      15.   Upon replacement of the topsoil, trees, shrubs, legumes, grasses or
ground cover, native species if possible shall be planted in accordance with
the approved landscape, soil erosion control and reclamation plan.
      16.   Whenever production on any property shall have been completed, all
buildings, plants, structures (except fences) and equipment shall be entirely
removed within six (6) months after such completion, unless same are to be used
in connection with the reclamation project proposed or relative to the removal
of stored materials. Any and all stockpiled materials shall be removed in not
more than two (2) years following cessation of production and the area occupied
by such stockpiled material, or materials, shall then be restored as provided
for in the reclamation plan.
      17.   Whenever production on any property involves blasting such
operation shall be in accordance with the Illinois department of mines and
minerals regulations. In addition, these operations shall have a seismograph
located on site available to calibrate ground disturbances in close proximity
to the mining.
      18.   Concrete and asphalt may be stockpiled on the mining site for
recycling purposes only. Recycling of these materials may only be conducted in
conjunction with a licensed mining operation and in accordance with Illinois
environmental protection agency applicable regulations. Concrete and asphalt to
be recycled and its byproducts (such as, but not limited to, reinforcing bar
and wire mesh), must be properly processed and disposed of at a minimum of one
time per year. All activity associated with concrete and asphalt recycling
shall not be conducted closer than two hundred feet (200') from the boundaries
of an adjoining property line. Maximum height of stockpiles shall not exceed
berms as approved on the reclamation map, and/or exceed the height of
excavation below grade.
All recycled materials shall be certified as to origin and potential for
groundwater or surface water contamination. A settling basin shall be provided
for all runoff generated from recycled materials and associated activities. A
minimum one hundred foot (100') separation from any surface waters shall be
provided from recycled materials and associated activities.
25-15-1-5: SETBACK REQUIREMENTS:

25-16-3: SETBACK RESOLUTION:
Whereas, the 1933 general assembly adopted an act entitled "an act to authorize
and empower county boards to establish building or setback lines on or along
any road, street, trafficway, drive or parkway outside the corporate limits of
cities, villages and incorporated towns", and
Whereas, the purpose of granting this authority as stated in said act is "to
the end that adequate safety may be secured and the congestion of public roads,
streets, trafficways, drives and parkways may be lessened or avoided".
Therefore, be it resolved by the county board of Kane County, Illinois, that no
building, structure, or concrete, stone or masonry wall (but not including wire
or open wood fences) shall be erected, structurally altered or placed so that
any part thereof is nearer to the established centerline of any adjoining
public street or highway than the distance specified in the county zoning
ordinance or such street or highway, and
Be it further resolved, that the requirements of this resolution shall be
enforced by the enforcing officer of the zoning ordinance and as provided in
the state act relating thereto, and
Be it further resolved, that this resolution shall be in full force and effect
from and after the passage thereof.
(Adopted December 13, 1938)
25-16-4: PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT:
The zoning department is hereby authorized, with the concurrence of the zoning
board, to promulgate forms and procedures relative to the implementation and
enforcement of this chapter.
Such instructions for procedures shall be attached for informational purposes
as section
25-16-5, "Appendix A, Instructions", of this chapter. (Ord. 80-37, § 7, 3-13-
1980)
25-16-5: APPENDIX A, INSTRUCTIONS:
25-16-5-1: INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILING REQUEST FOR REZONING OR SPECIAL USE:
Request for the rezoning of property, or for certain special uses of property,
as set forth in these instructions must be addressed to the Kane County zoning
board of appeals, 719 S. Batavia Avenue, Geneva, IL 60134, attention of the
zoning enforcing officer in a form prescribed by the Kane County development
and community services department. Certification that all property owners
within two hundred fifty feet (250') of the property lines of the parcel which
is the subject of the rezoning/special use have been notified must be filed
with the department along with the rezoning or special use application. A
public notice sign or signs are to be obtained from the department. This sign
is to be placed conspicuously on the property which is the subject of the
rezoning or special use at the end of the right of way along a public road,
street, driveway or any other easement of access. The posting of multiple signs
may be required as deemed appropriate by the department. The owner is to
certify the sign was posted at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the
zoning board of appeals meeting. The sign can be removed after the development
committee meeting at which the rezoning or special use request is to be
considered.
The request must set forth the legal description of the property involved. This
description must be accurate, as any rezoning is actually an amendment to the
zoning ordinance itself, and upon adoption by the county board, the maps, which
are a part of the ordinance, are changed to show the reclassification.
A land use opinion must accompany the petition for rezoning or special use.
Application blanks for this purpose may be obtained from the Kane-DuPage soil
and water conservation district office located at 545 Randall Road, St.
Charles, IL 60174.
An endangered species consultation agency action report must accompany any
rezoning or special use request involving land zoned F district - farming.
Application blanks for this purpose may be obtained from the endangered and
threatened species program manager, Illinois department of natural resources,
524 South Second Street, Springfield, IL 62701 - phone: 217-785-8774.
The request should also state what the existing classification of the property
is, under the zoning ordinance, and what classification is desired. Information
regarding the necessary classification for the use desired can be obtained
directly from the zoning ordinance. In the case of a request for certain
special uses, requiring a hearing before the zoning board, and approval by the
county board, it must be determined first, if the zoning classification is
correct and then a request for establishing the particular use desired should
be submitted. If the zoning classification is not correct for the special use
desired, the request for rezoning and for the special use shall be incorporated
in the same petition.
It is necessary that a detailed sketch, showing the location of proposed
buildings and parking areas, be submitted with the petition. This should also
show proposed entrance(s) and exitway(s) to and from the public highway.
Authority for location of such entrance(s) and exitway(s) must be obtained from
the particular highway commissioner having jurisdiction. To promote safety,
these should be kept to a minimum and it is necessary to consult the state
highway department regarding the locations of such entrance(s) and exitway(s)
where said entrance(s) and exitway(s) are located on state highways. If a
township, county, or state road is adjacent to the property involved in the
rezoning or special use request, it may be necessary to dedicate right of way.
To determine this, contact Kane County division of transportation, 41W011
Burlington Road, St. Charles, Illinois. (Ord. 92-187, 9-8-1992; Ord. 97-240, 9-
9-1997; Ord. 05-304, 9-13-2005; Ord. 12-295, 10-9-2012)
25-16-5-2: INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING APPLICATION FOR A VARIATION:
Application for a variation from the zoning ordinance of Kane County must be
addressed to the Kane County Zoning Board Of Appeals, 719 S. Batavia Avenue,
Geneva, IL 60134, attention of the zoning enforcing officer, in a form
prescribed by the Kane County development and community services department.
The application must set forth the legal description of the property involved.
This description should be copied from the deed covering the property and must
be accurate, as it is necessary to locate the property on the zoning maps,
using said description. In addition to the description, the actual variation
desired must also be set forth, with a clear explanation of what is wanted and
why the request is made. This explanation should show why the regular
requirements of the zoning ordinance cannot be met, and must show proof that a
particular hardship would result if a variation were not granted. Such a
hardship must not be self-created.
A sketch of the property involved, drawn to scale, must accompany the
application for a variation. This sketch should show the outline and dimensions
of the property and all the buildings and structures located thereon. The
distances from the buildings to the property line must be measured accurately
and be shown on the sketch. The portion of the building or structure for which
a variation is requested should be clearly shown on the sketch. The name and
address of the applicant must be given. The petition must be signed by the
owner of record of the property. In case the property is under purchase
contract, the owner of record must sign and the contract purchaser should also
sign the petition.
Certification that all property owners within two hundred fifty feet (250') of
property lines of the property on which the variance is sought have been
notified must be filed with the department along with the variation
application. A public notice sign or signs are to be obtained from the
department. This sign is to be placed conspicuously on the property which is
the subject of the variance at the end of the right of way along a public road,
street, driveway or any other easement of access. The owner is to certify the
sign was posted at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the zoning board
of appeals meeting. The sign can be removed after the zoning board of appeals
meeting at which the variance request is to be considered. The form for filing
application is available in the offices of the development and community
services department, building A, 4th floor, government center, Geneva,
Illinois.
An aerial (air photo) showing parcels involved in the variation is required.
These may be obtained from the Sidwell Company, 28W240 North Avenue, West
Chicago, IL 60185.
In submitting an application for a variation, a fee as prescribed in section
25-4-9-1 of this chapter shall accompany same.
Pursuant to the state land trust disclosure act (bill 1508), if property
involved is listed under a "trust", a notarized certification, signed by the
trust officer, giving names, addresses and percentage of interest, of all
beneficiaries, is to be filed with all petitions.
Upon receipt of such an application, certification, air photo and fee, the

provide AC power to the EV through a standard connector.
   C.    Level 3: Direct Current (DC) is used for refueling BEV’s at various
amperage levels and voltage levels, most commonly 480 VAC, with power outputs
ranging between 25 and 175 kW of power and provides fifty (50) to five hundred
(500) range miles per hour connected. DCFCs convert AC from facility power and
output DC and Volts Direct Current (VDC), which then delivers DC power to the
BEV through a standard connector.
CHARGING STATION: Equipment that has as its primary purpose the transfer of
electric energy by conductive or inductive means to a battery or other energy
storage device located onboard an electric vehicle. Various types of charging
stations include:

28-1-3: STATION REQUIREMENTS AND DESIGN CRITERIA:
28-1-3-1: GENERAL CHARGING STATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCES,
MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENCES, NONRESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY:
   A.   Charging Station Space Quality And Location Requirements:
      1.   Single-Family, Small Multifamily And Large Multifamily Residences:
It is the intent of the County of Kane to comply with the Electric Vehicle
Charging Act (765 ILCS 1085/1 et seq.). In accordance with the Electric Vehicle
Charging Act, the following provisions apply to newly constructed single-family
residences, small multifamily residences, and large multifamily residences that
have parking spaces and are constructed after January 1, 2024:
         a.   Single-Family Residences And Small Multifamily Residences: A new
single-family residence or small multifamily residence shall have at least one
EV-capable parking space for each residential unit that has dedicated parking.
A new single-family residence or small multifamily residence that qualifies as
an affordable housing development shall have one EV-capable parking space for
each code-required parking space if the owner is issued a building permit after
January 1, 2026.
         b.   Large Multifamily Residences: A new large multifamily residential
building, or a large multifamily residential building being renovated by a
developer converting the property to an Association, shall have one hundred
percent (100%) of its total parking spaces EV-capable. The term "Association"
has the meaning set forth in the Electric Vehicle Charging Act.
      2.   Nonresidential: In order to proactively plan for and accommodate the
anticipated future growth in market demand for electric vehicles, it is
strongly encouraged, but not required, that all new and expanded nonresidential
development parking areas provide the electrical capacity necessary to
accommodate the future hardwire installation of level 2 charging stations. It
is recommended that a typical parking lot (e.g., one thousand (1,000) or less
parking spaces) have a minimum ratio of two percent (2%) of the total parking
spaces prepared for such stations.

      3.   Accessible Charging Stations: It is strongly encouraged, but not
required, that a minimum of one accessible charging station be provided on non-
residential properties. Accessible charging stations should be located in close
proximity to the building or facility entrance and shall be connected to a
barrier free accessible route of travel to and from the building or facility.
It is not necessary to designate the accessible charging station exclusively
for the use of disabled persons. Below are two (2) options for providing for
accessible electric vehicle charging stations.
   OFF STREET ACCESSIBLE CHARGING STATION EXAMPLE - OPTION 1
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/c6e362eeb1bbddea4787b2f88d5d59b293aa0ea7/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3247.png]
 
   OFF STREET ACCESSIBLE CHARGING STATION EXAMPLE - OPTION 2
 [https://export.amlegal.com/media/c6e362eeb1bbddea4787b2f88d5d59b293aa0ea7/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3249.png]
   Comment: The illustrations and photos above show two (2) options for
providing accessible charging stations. Option 1 is a likely scenario for
installation in existing parking lots. By using an existing wider end parking
stall or restriping, an accessible charging station may be more cost
effectively installed. Where feasible, a wider clear area around the equipment
(sixty (60) inches) is preferable. Additionally, this location away from the
near building prime parking has a better likelihood of being available for
disabled persons, since the accessible charging station is not exclusively
reserved for disabled persons. Option 2 provides a location that has a shorter
travel distance for disabled persons and can be easily installed in a new
parking lot. This option may allow the installer to provide a wider, more fully
compliant aisle.
   While other options, depending on the specific layout of the new or
reconfigured parking area, are likely, at a minimum, an accessible charging
station must be located within accessible reach of the barrier free access
aisle (minimum forty-four (44) inch width) and the electric vehicle and connect
to a barrier free route of travel. However, because the charging station
facility is not a parking facility, the accessible charging station does not
need to be located immediately adjacent to the building entrances or reserved
exclusively for the use of disabled persons.
   B.   Charging Station Space Location And Design Criteria:
      1.   Where provided, spaces for charging station purposes are required to
include the following:
         a.   Signage: Each charging station space shall be posted with signage
indicating the charging station space is only for use by electric vehicles for
charging purposes. Days and hours of operations shall be included if time
limits or tow away provisions are to be enforced.
         b.   Maintenance: Charging station equipment shall be maintained in
all respects. A phone number or other contact information shall be provided on
the charging station equipment for reporting purposes when the equipment is not
functioning or other equipment problems are encountered.
         c.   Accessibility: Where charging station equipment is provided
within a pedestrian circulation area, such as a sidewalk or other accessible
route to a building entrance, the charging station equipment shall be located
so as not to interfere with accessibility requirements of the Illinois
accessibility code or other applicable accessibility standards.
         d.   Lighting: Where charging station equipment is installed, adequate
site lighting shall be provided in accordance with county of Kane ordinances
and regulations.
         e.   Charging Station Equipment: Charging station outlets and
connector devices shall be no less than thirty six inches (36") and no higher
than forty eight inches (48") from the ground or pavement surface where
mounted, and shall contain a retraction device and/or a place to hang permanent
cords and connectors a sufficient and safe distance above the ground or
pavement surface. Equipment mounted on pedestals, lighting posts, bollards, or
other devices shall be designated and located as to not impede pedestrian
travel or create trip hazards on sidewalks.
         f.   Charging Station Equipment Protection: Adequate charging station
equipment protection, such as concrete filled steel bollards, shall be used.
Nonmountable curbing may be used in lieu of bollards, if the charging station
is set back a minimum of twenty four inches (24") from the face of the curb.
         g.   Usage Fees: An owner of a charging station is not prohibited from
collecting a fee for the use of a charging station, in accordance with
applicable state and federal regulations. Fees shall be prominently displayed
on the charging station.
      2.   Those providing charging station spaces should consider the
following:
         a.   Notification: Information on the charging station, identifying
voltage and amperage levels and time of use, fees, or safety information.
         b.   Signage: Installation of directional signs at appropriate
decision points to effectively guide motorists to the charging station space
(s).
         c.   Location (Specific To On Street Parking): Placement of a single
charging station is preferred at the beginning or end stall on a block face.
   C.   Data Collection: To allow for maintenance and notification, the county
of Kane shall require the owners of public charging stations to provide
information on the charging station's geographic location, date of
installation, equipment type and model, and owner contact information.
