renovating, custom fabricating, improving, moving, wrecking, painting,
decorating, demolishing, and adding to or substracting from any public

structure, project or development, real property or improvement herein
described of any material or article of merchandise, which is paid for out of a
public fund or out of a special assessment and which contract for such work
will exceed the sum of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00). The term also
includes any public works leased by a political subdivision under a lease
containing an option to purchase. For purposes of this section, the term
"public works" does not include the following: landscaping, any work and/or
maintenance done by Village employees, and any specific project exempted from
this section by action of the Village Board where the Village Board finds such
project requires a particular skill, experience and expertise necessary for
successful completion of the project. The Village retains the authority under
Illinois law to not seek and advertise for bids on a project provided two-
thirds (2/3) of the Village Trustees holding office approve the contract.
   B.   Bid Submission Requirements: In determining whether a bidder is a
"responsible bidder" for the award of a public works contract, the bidder must
submit the following information and supporting documentation verified under
oath on a form designated by the authority, in order for the bid to be
accepted:
      1.   Documents evidencing compliance with all applicable laws and
ordinances pre-requisite to doing business in Illinois.
      2.   Documents evidencing current registration with the Illinois
Department of Revenue if bidder has employees (e.g., document with account
number, Illinois Business Tax number).
      3.   Documents evidencing current registration with the Illinois
Department of Employment Security if bidder has employees (e.g., document with
UI account number).
      4.   Disclosure of any Federal, State or local tax liens or tax
delinquencies against the contractor or any officers of the contractor in the
last five (5) years.
      5.   A statement that all employees are: a) covered under a current
workers' compensation insurance policy and b) properly classified under such
policy. If the bidder is insured with a carrier, the evidence of workers'
compensation insurance shall be a copy of the "information page" of the
contractor's workers' compensation policy and any continuation of that
information page which include the name and address of the insured, as well as
the class codes the compensation premium is based on and the total estimated
remuneration per class code.
      6.   A statement of compliance with all provisions of the Illinois
Prevailing Wage Act 1  and all rules and regulations therein, for the past five
(5) years. Such statement shall also provide that the contractor has reviewed
the Prevailing Wage Act or Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts, has reviewed
and agrees to pay the applicable prevailing wage rates attached to the bid
specifications, and will strictly comply with the Prevailing Wage Act or
Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts and related requirements. A contractor who
has been found by the Illinois Department of Labor to be in violation of the
Prevailing Wage Act twice within a three (3) year period shall be deemed not to
be a responsible bidder for two (2) years from the date of the latest finding.
      7.   A copy of the written program for the prevention of substance abuse
to be filed with a public body pursuant to the Substance Abuse Prevention on
Public Works Projects Act 2 .
      8.   A statement that individuals who will perform work on the public
works project on behalf of the contractor are properly classified as either: a)
an employee or b) an independent contractor under all applicable State and
Federal laws and local ordinances.
      9.   Documents evidencing any professional or trade license required by
law or local ordinance for any trade or specialty area in which the contractor
is seeking a contract award. Additionally, the contractor must disclose any
suspension or revocation of such license held by the company, or of any
director, officer or manager of the company.
      10.   Evidence of participation in apprenticeship and training programs
applicable to the work to be performed on the project which are approved by and
registered with the United States Department of Labor's Office of
Apprenticeship, or its successor organization. The required evidence includes a
copy of all applicable apprenticeship standards and Apprenticeship Agreement(s)
for any apprentice(s) who will perform work on the public works project.
      11.   Bidder shall certify that all employees expected to perform work on
the project have completed a 10-hour or greater OSHA safety program within the
last five (5) years. Only workers that have satisfactorily completed a 10-hour
or greater OSHA safety program will be allowed to participate on the project.
The bidder must have copies of employee OSHA cards on file, and the authority
may request the bidder provide copies of employees OSHA cards; failure to
produce an employee's OSHA card may result in a determination that the bidder
is not a responsible bidder.
      12.   Disclosure of the name and address of each subcontractor from whom
the contractor has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on any part of the
project. Further, each such subcontractor shall be required to adhere to the
requirements set forth herein as though it were bidding directly to the
authority. Each contractor shall submit all subcontractor information and
supporting documentation to the authority prior to the subcontractor commencing
work on the project.
      13.   Statements as to past performance, which shall give an accurate and
complete record of all public works projects completed in the past three (3)
years by the contractor. Such statements shall include the name of the public
body and the project, original contract price, final contract price, and the
names of all subcontractors used, if applicable, and a statement as to
compliance with completion deadlines.
Any material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be reported
in writing to the authority within fourteen (14) days of its occurrence.
Failure to comply with this requirement is grounds for the contractor to be
deemed a non-responsible bidder.
   C.   Incomplete Submissions By Bidders And Subcontractors: It is the sole
responsibility of the contractor to comply with all submission requirements at
the time it submits its bid to the authority. Contractor submissions deemed
inadequate or incomplete may result in a determination that the contractor is
not a responsible bidder.
The submission requirements also apply to all subcontractors, except that the
contractor shall submit all subcontractor submissions to the authority prior to
the subcontractor commencing work on the project. Failure of a subcontractor to
submit the required information shall not disqualify the successful bidder from
performing work on the project and shall not constitute a contractual default
and/or breach by the successful bidder. However, the authority may withhold all
payments otherwise due for work performed by a subcontractor, until the
subcontractor submits the required information and the authority approves such
information.
   D.   Lowest Bidder Not Chosen: The Village shall comply with the
requirements of the law if not awarding a contract to the lowest bidder.
   E.   Multiple Low Bids: When two (2) or more responsible bidders submit the
same low bid, the contract award shall be determined by drawing lots at a
public meeting of the authority, unless one bidder is a local contractor and
one is a non-local contractor, in which event the local contractor shall be
awarded the contract.
   F.   Public Records: All information submitted by a contractor or
subcontractor pursuant to this section are subject to the requirements of the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act 3  if deemed public records.
   G.   Materiality: The requirements for this section are a material part of
the bid documents and the contract and the successful bidder shall insert this
section in all subcontracts. (Ord. 2018-01, 1-11-2018)

1-9-2: SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   Compliance With Laws: The village shall uphold all laws related to
sexual harassment.
   B.   Definition: "Sexual harassment" means any unwelcome sexual advances or
requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment;
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   C.   Examples Of Sexual Harassment:
      1.   Sexual harassment may involve individuals of the same or different
gender. Sexual harassment is most frequently associated with those situations
in which a power differential exists between persons involved; however, it also
may occur between individuals of the same status. Examples of conduct which
may, if continued or repeated, constitute sexual harassment are:
         a.   Unnecessary touching, patting, hugging, or brushing against a
person's body.
         b.   Staring, ogling, leering, whistling.
         c.   Sexually explicit statements, comments, questions, jokes, or
anecdotes.
         d.   Graphic comments about a person's clothing or body.
         e.   Sexually suggestive objects or pictures in the workplace.
         f.   Harassing use of the electronic mail or telephone communication
system.
         g.   Other physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
      2.   Such conduct, whether intended or not, constitutes sexual harassment
and is illegal under both state and federal law. Violations of this policy will
not be permitted.
   D.   Complaint Procedures:
      1.   Complaints Filed With Village:
         a.   The village encourages anyone who feels that he/she has been a
victim of sexual harassment to report such incidents to the village president
or a village board member. Complainants are urged to report sexual harassment
incidents as soon as possible, since a delay in reporting may make it difficult
to gather appropriate information and documentation. It is not necessary for
sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the complaint. The
following steps may also be taken: document or record each incident (what was
said or done, the date, the time and the place). Documentation can be
strengthened by written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone
messages.
         b.   Complaints will be kept in confidence to the extent practicable
and appropriate under the circumstances. (Ord. 2000-06, 5-3-2000)
         c.   The village president, with approval of the board, shall appoint
a committee of at least three (3) people, one of whom shall be the legal
counsel for the village. The role of the committee will be to hear and consider
testimony and other relevant reliable evidence, to make findings of fact, to
determine whether the village policy on sexual harassment has been violated,
and if so, to recommend appropriate relief and disciplinary action(s). A copy
of the written decision shall be promptly furnished to the employee making the
complaint. (Ord. 2000-06, 5-3-2000; amd. 2013 Code)
         d.   The employee will be able to have a representative present at any
discussion between the employee and the village board or committee.
      2.   Complaint Filed With State: The employee making the complaint may
elect to file a written complaint with the Illinois department of human rights
or the Illinois human rights commission. The alternative complaint avenues are
available if the employee would prefer to use them instead of the internal
procedures.

         Illinois human rights commission 217-785-4350
   E.   Protection From Retaliation: The employee is protected by the Illinois
human rights act 1  from retaliation because he or she has opposed that which
he or she reasonably and in good faith believes to be unlawful sexual
harassment in employment or because he or she has made a charge, filed a
complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation under this
chapter. (Ord. 2000-06, 5-3-2000)
   F.   Penalties: Penalties shall be provided as allowed by law. (2013 Code)
 
Notes

recruitment, recruitment advertising, employment, placement, layoff or
termination, promotion, demotion or transfer, rate of pay or other forms of

vendors, etc., who practice or establish a pattern of discrimination based on
sex, color, race, religion, age, developmentally disabled/handicap, national
origin, political affiliation or belief.
   C.   The village assures that it will actively provide nondiscriminatory
outreach, selection, and service to all individuals.
   D.   Efforts will be made to hire minority individuals for all categories so
that minority employment in all categories of the work force will represent a
proportionate share of minority populations in the village as well as
surrounding areas.
   E.   The village will provide accommodations to the best of its ability for
developmentally disabled/handicapped employees contingent on budget and
structural limitations. (Ord. 2000-06, 5-3-2000)

1-10-3: Procedure For Reporting An Allegation Of Sexual Harassment
1-10-4: Prohibition On Retaliation For Reporting Sexual Harassment Allegations

1-10-6: Consequences For Knowingly Making A False Report
 
Notes
  1. This policy was drafted using the Illinois Department of Human Rights
1 Sexual Harassment Model Policy and has been modified to conform to Public Act
  100-0554.
1-10-1: PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have
determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII
of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a
right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment
is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual
orientations. It is a policy of the Village of North Utica to prohibit
harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal
employee, municipal agency or municipal office on the basis of sex or gender.
All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal
agencies or municipal offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any
person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. (Ord. 2018-
37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-29, 11-12-2020)
1-10-2: DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
   A.   This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the
Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as:
   Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct
of a sexual nature when:
      1.   Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an
individual's employment, either explicitly or implicitly; or
      2.   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
      3.   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
offensive working environment.
   B.   Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes, but is not
limited to:
      1.   Verbal Harassment: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults,
humor, jokes about: sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual
propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates; or, statements of a sexual
nature about other employees, even outside of their presence.
      2.   Non-verbal Harassment: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling),
leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls,"
"smacking" or "kissing" noises.
      3.   Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature,
viewing pornographic material or websites.
      4.   Physical Harassment: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing,
pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault.
      5.   Textual/Electronic Harassment: "sexting" (electronically sending
messages with sexual content, including pictures or video), the use of sexually
explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of
electronic communication (email/text/picture/video messages, intranet/online
postings, blogs, instant messages and posts on social network websites, like
Facebook and Twitter).
      The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to
determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more
subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and
interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what
would offend a "reasonable person." (Ord. 2018-37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-
29, 11-12-2020)
1-10-3: PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself
to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as
directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to
the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary
for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report.
Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment,
including the following:
   A.   Electronic/Direct Communication: If there is sexual harassment behavior
in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express
her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending
behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are
needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo.
   B.   Contact With Supervisory Personnel. At the same time direct
communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or
intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the
immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a
director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or
administrator or the chief elected official of the municipality.
   The employee experiencing what she/he believes to be sexual harassment must
not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses
and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the
municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment.
   C.   Resolution Outside Municipality: The purpose of this policy is to
establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every
report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the
municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the
Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with
those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 300 days of the alleged
incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must
also be filed within 300 days.
   D.   Allegations of Sexual Harassment Made Against an Elected Official of
the Governmental Unit by Another Elected Official of a Governmental Unit: In
addition to the methods of reporting included above, an elected official may
request an independent review of a complaint of sexual harassment by another
elected official. The request shall be made to the human resources director,
the city manager or administrator or the chief elected official of the
municipality. The official receiving the request shall take immediate action in
keeping with the procurement process of the municipality to retain a qualified
individual or entity for the independent review of the allegations of sexual
harassment in violation of this policy. The outcome of the independent review
shall be reported to the corporate authorities.
   Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was
said or done, the date, the time and the location), including, but not limited
to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages.
   All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and
investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the
municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment
charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the
questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a
vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. (Ord. 2018-
37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-29, 11-12-2020)
1-10-4: PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS:
   A.   No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or
municipal office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal
employee or official due to a municipal employee's or official's:
      1.   Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
or
      2.   Providing information related to an investigation or testimony
before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any
violation of this policy; or
      3.   Assistance with or participation in a proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this policy.
   B.   For purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand,
discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer or change in
the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken
in retaliation for a municipal employee's or official's involvement in
protected activity pursuant to this policy.
   C.   No individual making a report will be retaliated against, even if a
report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will
be protected from retaliation.
   D.   Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the
State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides
whistleblower protection from retaliatory action, and this policy prohibits
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or
denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who
does any of the following:
      1.   Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public
body an activity, policy or practice of any officer, member, agency or other
employee that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule
or regulation; or
      2.   Provides information to or testifies before any public body
conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of a law,
rule or regulation by any officer, member, agency or other employee; or
      3.   Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of
the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act or this policy.
   E.   Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may
not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an
administrative hearing, before a legislative commission or committee or in any
other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule or
regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the
employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a
violation of a state or federal law, rule or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)).
   F.   According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a
civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire to
retaliate against a person because she/he has opposed that which she/he
reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment,
because she/he has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted or
participated in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under the Illinois
Human Rights Act.
   G.   An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed
over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge within three hundred (300) days of the alleged retaliation.
(Ord. 2018-37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-29, 11-12-2020)
1-10-5: CONSEQUENCES OF A VIOLATION OF THE PROHIBITION ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT:
In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to
municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/
or collective bargaining agreements, any person who violates this policy or the
Prohibition on Sexual Harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject
to a fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) per offense, applicable
disciplinary actions or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines
and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal
law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed
by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by
an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a
state or federal agency. (Ord. 2018-37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-29, 11-12-
2020)
1-10-6: CONSEQUENCES FOR KNOWINGLY MAKING A FALSE REPORT:
A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser to
accomplish an outcome other than stopping sexual harassment or stopping
retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report
made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the
consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense
that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally
makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall
be subject to disciplinary action or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal
policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or
collective bargaining agreements.
In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a
violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to
an ethics commission, an inspector general, the Illinois State Police, a
State's Attorney, the Attorney General or any other law enforcement official is
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an
administrative fine of up to five thousand dollars ($5,000) against any person
who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation. (Ord. 2018-
37, 12-12-2018; amd. Ord. 2020-29, 11-12-2020)

filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. Except for the amount of tax and interest due
under this section, a taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period
before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which
case, the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this

shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:

2004)
         c.   The petitioner shall post a sign on the property that is subject
to the variance at least ten (10), but not more than thirty (30), days prior to
the hearing. The village will supply a sign upon payment by the petitioner of a
fifty dollar ($50.00) deposit. The sign shall be displayed in a prominent
location on the property until the conclusion of the hearing. The Village
reserves the right to specify the location on the property of the placement.

permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
that zone.
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances.
      3.   A variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality.

the alleged hardship.
      5.   The variance would not allow the owner or occupant to enjoy some
special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of
other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely the inability of the owner
to make more money from the use of the subject lot.
      6.   The variance would not increase the danger of fire or floods,
endanger the public safety, or increase the need for repairs to roads,
utilities, and other public facilities.
      7.   The variance would not result in a use or development of the subject
lot that would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes of this
title or the general purpose and intent of the North Utica comprehensive plan.

commission for further consideration.
      2.   No variance shall become effective unless it is first submitted to
and approved by the Planning Commission, or if disapproved, shall receive a
two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the Village Board. If the commission neither
approves nor disapproves the variance within sixty (60) days after the same has
been submitted, it shall be considered to be approved by the commission.
However, the commission may extend this time for the purposes of continuing the
public hearing.
   F.   Conditions Of Variance: In granting a variance, the Board may attach
thereto any conditions and safeguards it deems necessary or desirable in

detrimental, long range effect on the development of surrounding land uses.

effect on surrounding property values.

      5.   The proposed rezoning or text amendment promotes the health, safety,
and welfare of the general public.
      6.   The proposed rezoning or text amendment constitutes an expansion of
an existing zoning district that, due to the lack of undeveloped land, can no
longer meet the demand for the intended land uses.

and can be supported through sufficient public infrastructure and services.

same has been submitted, it shall be considered to be approved by the

modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)
10-12-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is the base flood. The best available base
flood data are listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available
data, the party shall finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace
the existing data with better data and submit it to FEMA and IDNR/OWR for
approval prior to any development of the site.
   A.   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of the Illinois River and

10-12-9: PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER STANDARDS:
   A.   Public health standards must be met for all floodplain development. In
addition to the requirements of sections
10-12-6 and
10-12-7 of this chapter, the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer, or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of section
10-12-7 of this chapter.
      2.   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      3.   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      4.   New and replacement on site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other aboveground openings
located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight.
      5.   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet (3') above
the level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation, whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
   B.   All other activities defined as "development" shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-
13-2011)
10-12-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in
writing thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration
or relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)
10-12-11: VARIANCES:
   A.   Authority: Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship
on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village
board of trustees for a variance. The village board of trustees may refer the
matter to the village planning commission to review the applicant's request for
a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the village board of
trustees. The board of trustees may attach such conditions to the granting of a
variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   B.   Standards For Variance Request: No variance shall be granted unless the
applicant demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain;
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or
creation of a nuisance;
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP; and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   C.   Variances From Building Protection Standards Generally: The zoning
enforcement officer shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from
the requirements of the building protection standards of section
10-12-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a
building will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)
   D.   Historic Landmarks: Variances to the building protection requirements
of section
10-12-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a "historic structure", as defined in section
10-12-2 of this chapter, may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
10-12-6 and
10-12-7 of this chapter, subject to the conditions that: (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-
2011; amd. 2013 Code)
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   E.   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance
issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and wet
floodproofed:
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farmhouses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the village flood insurance rate map
(FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
10-12-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
10-12-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
10-12-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection 10-12-7B1 of this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
10-12-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the zoning enforcement officer and a registered professional
engineer or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development
permit for construction. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)
10-12-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully hereunder. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)
10-12-13: VIOLATIONS; PENALTIES:
   A.   Violation: Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain
or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be
deemed to be a violation of this chapter.
   B.   Determination And Notice Of Violation: Upon due investigation, the
zoning enforcement officer may determine that a violation of the minimum
standards of this chapter exists. The zoning enforcement officer shall notify
the owner in writing of such violation.
   C.   Injunction And Penalty: If such owner fails, after ten (10) days'
notice, to correct the violation:
      1.   The village shall make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense;
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      4.   The village shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   D.   Insurance Suspension: The zoning enforcement officer shall inform the
owner that any violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages
and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be
suspended.
   E.   Suspension Of Development:
      1.   Stop Work Order: The zoning enforcement officer is authorized to
issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop
work order shall be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall
order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop
work order. The stop work order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      2.   Hearing:
         a.   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the board of trustees. Written notice of
such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
            (1)   The grounds for the complaint and the reasons for suspension
or revocation; and
            (2)   The time and place of the hearing.
         b.   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to
present evidence on his behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of
trustees shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   F.   Other Remedies: Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking
such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs
connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord.
2011-19, 7-13-2011)
10-12-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the village to
fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program including
ordinance 2001-10, adopted August 15, 2001, and ordinance 2004-26, adopted
September 22, 2004. However, this chapter does not repeal the original
resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program, nor does
this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements,
covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2011-19, 7-13-2011)

circulation and off street parking and loading spaces. The building permit
application shall include a site plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned,
showing any parking or loading facilities to be provided and all proposed or
existing streets and curbs, easements, and rights of way in compliance with the
requirements of this title.
   B.   Future Uses; Existing Building Permit: All buildings or structures
erected after the effective date hereof shall provide off street parking and
loading spaces. Parking or loading facilities shall be required for a building
or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective
date hereof if construction is begun thereon within six (6) months of the
effective date hereof and diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Existing Uses: All off street parking and loading facilities in
existence on or before the effective date hereof and located on the same lot as
the building or structure shall not hereafter be reduced below the similar
requirements for a similar new building or structure under the provisions of
this title.
   D.   Increase In Intensity Of Use: When the intensity of use of any
building, structure, or premises shall be increased through the addition of
dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of
measurement specified, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall
be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least fifty
percent (50%) of any existing deficiency in parking or loading facilities.
   E.   Change Of Use: Whenever the existing use of a building or structure is
changed to a new use, the appropriate off street parking and loading facilities
shall be provided for the new use. However, if the building or structure was
erected prior to the effective date hereof, then any additional off street
parking and loading facilities are mandatory only if the requirements for the
new use exceed those for the previous use.
   F.   Damage Or Destruction: Any building, structure, or use which is in
existence on the effective date hereof, and which subsequently shall be damaged
or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, may be
reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired if the parking and loading facilities
meet or exceed the requirements established in this chapter.
   G.   Location And Ownership Of Facilities: Except as provided in section
10-14-3 of this chapter, all off street parking and loading facilities shall be
located on the same lot, on an adjacent lot, or across a public street or alley
from the principal use it serves. Off street parking spaces may be located on
surface lots, underground, under a building, or in parking structures.
   H.   Exceptions: Unless otherwise specified, off street parking facilities
are not required for uses within the C-1 central business district and may only
be located in the rear yards of lots. Curb cuts and driveways are not
recommended in order to consolidate parking space in appropriate locations and
ensure a compact C-1 district. Dwelling units located in this district shall
provide two (2) off street parking spaces per dwelling unit. (Ord. 2004-26, 9-
22-2004, eff. 9-22-2004)
10-14-3: JOINT PARKING FACILITIES:
Off street parking for separate uses may be provided collectively in any
district if the total number of spaces provided meets or exceeds the
requirements for each separate use. The village board may reduce the number of
joint parking spaces by up to twenty percent (20%) if shared parking lots are
utilized and the respective hours of operation do not substantially overlap.
The property owners of the respective uses must prove that there is no
substantial overlap in the hours of operation. (Ord. 2004-26, 9-22-2004, eff.
9-22-2004)
10-14-4: ADDITIONAL OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Design:
      1.   Dimensional Requirements: All off street parking lots shall be
governed by the dimensional requirements for parking lots specified in
"Architectural Graphic Standards", current edition, and shall meet the minimum
requirements of a "parking space", as defined in section
10-2-2 of this title. (Ord. 2004-26, 9-22-2004, eff. 9-22-2004; amd. 2013 Code)
      2.   Vertical Clearance: Each space shall have a vertical clearance of
not less than seven feet (7').
      3.   Access: Each off street parking space shall open directly to an
aisle or driveway in order to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular
access. All off street parking facilities shall provide safe access to a public
street or alley. No driveway or curb cut in any district shall exceed thirty
feet (30') in width.
      4.   Surfacing And Striping:
         a.   All open off street parking areas and driveways, except those
accessory to rural residential district dwellings, shall be improved by
constructing with either:
            (1)   Eight inches (8") of compacted gravel base surfaced with
three inches (3") of asphaltic concrete; or
            (2)   Six inches (6") of concrete laid over a firm base.
         b.   Striping of the surface to define the parking space shall be
provided and visible at all times.
      5.   Screening And Landscaping:
         a.   Within any district and visible from any public or private
street, a five foot (5') landscaped divider strip shall be placed between all
sidewalks and parking areas containing six (6) or more cars. The landscaping
must contain one ornamental or evergreen tree and four (4) bushes for every
thirty feet (30') of frontage.
         b.   In addition to the perimeter screening, within any lot containing
at least twenty five (25) parking spaces, one ornamental or evergreen tree and
four (4) shrubs shall be planted for every one hundred (100) square feet of all
parking spaces to be located on an interior strip of private property at a
width of at least ten feet (10'). At least five percent (5%) of the interior
parking lot shall be landscaped. Trees shall be evenly spaced whenever
possible.
         c.   Within or adjacent to a residential district, all open off street
parking areas containing six (6) or more cars shall be effectively screened by
a wall, a solid fence, or a densely planted compact hedge along any side which
is adjacent to property in residential use unless that use is at least seventy
five feet (75') from the nearest residential property line. The screening shall
be at least ten feet (10') from any driveway opening and shall not interfere
with the visibility of vehicles or pedestrians.
   B.   Computation Of Spaces: The determination of the required number of
parking spaces shall be based on the principal use on the zoning lot. When
determination of the number of required off street parking spaces results in a
requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half
(1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction over one-half (1/2) shall be
interpreted as one parking space.
   C.   Signs: Signs may be displayed in any nonresidential district if they
are not larger than six (6) square feet in area, do not exceed six feet (6') in
height, located not more than ten feet (10') from any driveway or alley which
leads to the parking area, and not located within the public right of way. No
signs shall be displayed in any parking area within any residential district

   D.   Lighting: The level of illumination at any point in the parking lot
shall not be less than one foot-candle or more than three (3) foot-candles,
measured at the pavement. See each district for specific regulations. Any
lighting used to illuminate an off street parking area shall be so arranged as
to reflect the light away from adjoining property.
   E.   Drainage: Proper drainage and grading shall be provided to dispose of
all runoff water. For any parking area in excess of six (6) parking spaces, all
runoff water shall be disposed of in an approved stormwater sewer or other
maintenance free system. Any drainage shall conform to the provisions specified
in chapter 12 of this title.
   F.   Maintenance: All parking lots and landscaping shall be maintained and
kept free of weeds, litter, potholes, broken wheel stops, broken curbing, other
surface irregularities, dirt, and snow, whenever possible. All signs used to
indicate traffic movement and location shall be kept in a neat and legible
condition. In addition, all adjacent sidewalks shall be kept free of litter,
dirt, and snow. (Ord. 2004-26, 9-22-2004, eff. 9-22-2004)

   A.   Justification For Variance: When a property owner or his agent shows
that a strict application of the terms of this chapter relating to the use,
construction, or alteration of signs imposes upon him practical difficulties or
particular hardship in that a literal interpretation of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter, the property
owner or agent may apply for a sign variance. The burden of proof lies on the
applicant to clearly establish that a sign variance is necessary.
   B.   Application For Variance: An application for a sign variance shall be
made as follows:
      1.   Filing Application; Fee: The applicant shall file an application for
a sign variance with the village clerk accompanied by a filing fee to be
established by the village board.

the proposed sign variance and shall have attached thereto a diagram or plan
showing the result the proposed sign variance would have on the subject
property and surrounding properties.

               (A) The names, addresses, and phone numbers of the applicant,
owner, and person or firm erecting the sign.
               (B) Location of the building or structure for which the sign is
proposed.
               (C) A drawing of the proposed sign, to scale, indicating height,
dimensions, wording, and elevation and state specifically the type of sign,
location on the lot, and any landscaping of a freestanding sign base. The
drawing should show the entire lot complete with setbacks to all property
lines, existing building footprint, signs, north arrow, and scale.
               (D) A statement indicating the need for the sign variance.
            (2)   These requirements may be waived if the application is part
of a new sign installation, as each of these requirements is necessary for a
sign permit.
      3.   Date Of Filing: The application shall be filed prior to the date the
notice of hearing specified has been published in the local newspaper.
   C.   Date Of Hearing; Notice And Costs: The village planning commission,
through its chairperson, shall set a regular date, time, and place for a public
hearing on the application and shall inform the applicant of the same. The
chairperson has the option of changing the time and/or date if there is a
conflict with other meetings held concurrently at the village hall. The
applicant shall pay for all associated costs. Notice of the public hearing of
the petitioner's application is to be given in the following manner:
      1.   By publishing the notice of the date, time, and place of such
hearing in a paper of general circulation in the village at least fifteen (15),
but not more than thirty (30), days prior to the hearing.

the variance is requested as well as a brief statement describing the proposed

bounds or lot and block description, contain a simple description of the
property as to area and location of such a nature to enable the ordinary reader
to accurately locate such property.
      3.   The petitioner shall post a sign on the property that is subject to
the variance at least ten (10), but not more than thirty (30), days prior to
the hearing. The village will supply a sign upon payment by the petitioner of a
fifty dollar ($50.00) deposit. The sign shall be displayed in a prominent
location on the property until the conclusion of the hearing. The village
reserves the right to specify the location on the property of the placement.
The deposit shall be returned to the petitioner upon return of the sign in the
same condition as it was issued.
   D.   Public Hearing; Review And Decisions:
      1.   Hearing:

commission without a public hearing by the commission as required herein, and
every report shall be accompanied by findings of fact specifying the reasons
for the reported actions.

recommendation of the zoning enforcement officer, and the testimony at the
public hearing and shall grant the sign variance, grant the sign variance

circumstances peculiar to the property and not from general neighborhood or
villagewide conditions.

character of the locality.

alleviate the alleged hardship.

special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of
other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely the inability of the owner
to make more money from the use of the subject lot.

be in harmony with the general and specific purposes of this chapter or the
general purpose and intent of the village comprehensive plan.
   E.   Conditions Of Variance: In granting a sign variance, the planning
commission may attach thereto any conditions and safeguards it deems necessary
or desirable in furthering the purposes of this chapter. Violation of any of
these conditions or safeguards shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.

      1.   Manholes:
         a.   Location:
            (1)   Manholes are utilized to provide access to continuous
underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and cleanout and to
permit a change in direction, grade and size of sewer. Typical locations where
manholes should be specified are:
               (A)    Where two (2) or more storm sewers converge.
               (B)    At intermediate points along tangent sections.
               (C)    Where pipe size changes.
               (D)    Where an abrupt change in alignment occurs.
               (E)    Where an abrupt change of the grade occurs.
            (2)   Manholes should not be located in traffic lanes; however,
when it is impossible to avoid locating manholes in a traffic lane, care should
be taken to ensure it is not in the normal vehicle path.
         b.   Spacing: The spacing of manholes should be in accordance with the
following:
 
Sizes Of Pipe (Inches) Maximum Distance (Feet)
12 to 24               400
27 to 54               600
60 and up              1,000
 
         c.   Type: A manhole, type A (highway standard 1527), with appropriate
frame and lid, should be provided for the following sewer sizes when the depth
exceeds four feet (4'):
            (1)   When the sewer pipe diameter is eighteen inches (18") or
less, a four foot (4') diameter manhole should be provided.
            (2)   When the sewer pipe diameter is twenty one inches (21") to
forty two inches (42"), inclusive, a five foot (5') diameter manhole should be
provided.
            (3)   When the sewer pipe diameter is forty eight inches (48") or
larger, a six foot (6') diameter manhole (standard 2395) or a reinforced
concrete pipe tee (standard 2263) or a special design manhole should be
provided.
         d.   Hydraulic Losses: The following criteria should be used to
estimate hydraulic losses in storm sewer manholes:
            (1)   Allow a drop of 0.1 foot in a through manhole where there is
no change in the diameter of the sewer pipe.
            (2)   Allow a drop of 0.2 foot in the presence of one lateral or
bend.
            (3)   Allow a drop of 0.3 foot when two (2) laterals are present.
            (4)   In a through manhole where there is a change in the diameter
of the sewer pipe, no loss should be allowed if 0.8 foot depth in each sewer
pipe is attained by lowering the larger pipe.
         e.   Pipe Connections: The pipe tee and wye connections are permitted
for connecting lateral lines from pavement inlets to main storm sewer lines,
provided the following conditions are met:
            (1)   Manholes are provided at the required intervals.

            (3)   Precast connections are required unless designer verifies
that the structural and hydraulic integrity of the mainline sewer is not
affected by field connection.
         f.   Junction Chambers: The junction of small sewers is made in
manholes. On occasion, junction chambers of special design are required to join
two (2) or more converging large size storm sewers. In design, a smooth
transition is essential to prevent turbulence in flow which would cause eddies
and deposition of solids. Normally, junction chambers should not be utilized
when the trunk sewer is less than forty two inches (42") in diameter.
      2.   Inlets:
         a.   Inlets are drainage structures utilized to collect surface water
through grate or curb openings and convey the water to storm sewers or direct
outlet to culverts and ditches. Grate inlets should be provided with
appropriate frames and grates as provided in section B of the highway
standards.
         b.   An inlet type A (standard 1683) should be utilized when the sewer
pipe diameter is fifteen inches (15") or less and the depth of pipe is not more
than four feet (4'). For larger diameter pipes or where there is both an
incoming and outgoing pipe in the inlet, a larger diameter inlet structure,
such as inlet type B (standard 2349) or a three foot (3'), four foot (4') and
five foot (5') diameter catch basin or manhole should be specified. When such a
structure is used in a shallow pipe situation, a precast reinforced concrete
flat slab top, shown on standard 2354, should be used in lieu of the standard

CHAPTER 7
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
SECTION:
11-7-1: Findings And Purpose
11-7-2: General Principles
11-7-3: Erosion And Sedimentation Control Plan
11-7-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   A.   The village board finds as follows:
      1.   That excessive quantities of soil erodes from areas that are
undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses, including, but not
limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and
industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, and the creation of
recreational facilities.
      2.   That the washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and
upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing
vision and reducing traction of road vehicles.
      3.   That said soil erosion necessitates the costly repair of gullies,
washed out fills, and embankments.
      4.   That the sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and
ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs.
      5.   That said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most
beneficial purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life, and that said
sediment is costly and difficult to remove.
      6.   That said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways
resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding.
   B.   The village board, therefore, declares that the purpose of this chapter
is to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons, to protect property and
prevent the despoliation of the environment, and to promote the public welfare
by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials
and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks
the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in
the village. (Ord. 2005-39, 10-12-2005)
11-7-2: GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
The following general principles shall apply to any movement of earth, site
development, and execution of an erosion and soil sedimentation control plan:
   A.   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any given time
during development.
   B.   Such minimum area exposure shall be kept to as short a duration of time
as is practical.
   C.   Temporary vegetation or, where applicable, mulching or other cover
shall be used to protect areas exposed during development.
   D.   Sediment basins, debris basins, desalting basins, or silt traps shall
be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land
undergoing development.
   E.   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. Drainageways shall be designed so that their final gradients and
the resultant velocities of discharge will not create additional erosion in
accordance with the following requirements:
      1.   Permanent, final plant covering or structures shall be installed as
soon as possible.
      2.   The plan of development shall relate to the topography and soils of
the site so that the lowest potential for erosion is created.
      3.   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on the evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved. In the design of erosion control facilities and practices,
provisions shall be made for aesthetics, and the requirements of continuing
maintenance shall be minimized.
      4.   Natural plant covering shall be retained and protected to the
maximum extent possible, consistent with proper land planning and design and
development of the site.
      5.   Velocity retarding devices (temporary or permanent) shall be
installed to reduce the scouring of drainage ditches. (Ord. 2005-39, 10-12-
2005)
11-7-3: EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL PLAN:
   A.   Plan Required: An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be
required for any of the following:
      1.   Any grading, stripping, excavating, or filling of land with any
further development of that land coming at a later date.
      2.   All planned developments, residential subdivisions or multi- family,
commercial or industrial developments which are in excess of one acre.
      3.   All building sites, of any sizes, whether they be residential,
commercial or other.
   B.   Contents Of Plan: Each erosion and sedimentation control plan, which
may be included in the site development plans, shall contain the following:
      1.   The existing topography of the site and adjacent areas within one
hundred feet (100').
      2.   A complete physical survey of the site, including such land features
as rivers, swamps, type and location of plant life, tree groups, wells and any
existing structures.
      3.   A soil survey analysis.
      4.   A proposed grading plan including elevations of buildings and
structures, manhole covers, street profiles, sidewalks, ditches, driveways,
stormwater and sediment basins and berms.
      5.   Required initial clearing and stockpiling operations.
      6.   Sequence of all operations during construction.
      7.   All erosion and sedimentation control measures necessary to meet the
objectives of this section throughout all phases of construction and
permanently after completion of development of the site, including location,
type and configuration of such controls detailed on construction drawings and
in specifications.
      8.   Areas to be seeded and/or sodded, seeding mixtures and rates, types
of sod, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of
lime and fertilizer application, and kind and quantity of mulching for both
temporary and permanent vegetative control measures.
      9.   Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including
easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance.
      10.   Identification of the person(s) or entity which will have legal
responsibility for maintenance of erosion and sedimentation control structures
and measures after development is complete. (Ord. 2005-39, 10-12-2005)
