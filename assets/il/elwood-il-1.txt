GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 31.01 FIXED ASSET INVENTORY POLICY.
   (A)   Introduction. This manual will be used by the village to maintain the
Property Record/Fixed Asset System (PRFAS). The PRFAS consists of two segments:
fixed or capital assets and controllable assets. Fixed assets are further
categorized as: assets acquired by an enterprise fund; or assets acquired by
the governmental funds. The chapters of this manual are separated into the
various transactions required to maintain the system. The Finance Director has
oversight responsibility for the PRFAS, including the maintenance of reports,
the calculation of depreciation and the implementation of a physical inventory.
The Department heads are responsible for preparing initial documentation
necessary to develop an accurate database of village assets and assisting in
physical inventories.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this manual is to provide policy guidelines
and procedures for the inventory, depreciation, disposal and maintenance of all
property and assets owned or leased by the village. A property record/fixed
asset system is established to detail the procedures to track and account for
changes in the village’s assets. An accurate asset inventory provides for: the
valuation of assets for insurance and financial statements; the ability to
safeguard fixed assets; assistance in budget forecasting; and the
implementation of maintenance schedules.
      (2)   Scope. This manual provides for the inventory of all village-owned
or leased assets with a value equal to or in excess of $500 and having a useful
life of more than five years, and the capitalization and depreciation of all
enterprise fund assets equal to or greater than $500 in value and with a useful
life of more than five years, and the capitalization of governmental funds
(except infrastructure assets detailed in division (B)(3) below) equal to or
greater than $500 in value and with a useful life of more than five years.
      (3)   Procedure. When acquiring, transferring or disposing of a village-
owned or leased asset, review the asset categories to determine if the asset is
to be included in the system, select the category (fixed or controllable), and
prepare the proper documentation. The finance staff will calculate the
depreciation, if applicable, and make the appropriate adjustments to the
property record manual.
   (B)   Asset categories.
      (1)   Controllable assets. Controllable assets are required to be
expensed and included in the inventory of village assets. If the value of an
asset or a group of assets (such as folding chairs, desks and the like) is
equal to or greater than $500 and has a useful life greater than five years
then Form I-Inventory Addition/Deletion/Transfer form should be completed and
returned to Finance. Form I-Inventory Addition/Deletion/Transfer form should be
prepared when an item is received, retired (discarded, sold, theft) or
transferred to another department. Sample controllable assets are: audio/visual
equipment, computer software, calculators, minor equipment, microwaves, tools,
typewriters and weed trimmers.
      (2)   Fixed assets. Fixed assets or capital assets are tangible assets
with a value equal to or greater than $500 and a useful life in excess of five
years. These assets are obtained for the purpose of using for a long time or to
enhance the value of a building or land and having a significant value. These
assets are not intentionally acquired for resale, nor are they readily
convertible to cash. Fixed assets include buildings, machinery and equipment,
improvements other than buildings, and land. The capitalization of a fixed
asset means that enterprise assets are recorded in the fixed asset account on
the balance sheet and governmental fund assets are recorded as investments in
fixed assets in the general fixed asset account group. The policy for
infrastructure additions or improvements, except those acquired by an
enterprise fund, is discussed in division (B)(3) below.
         (a)   Fixed asset categories and subcategories.
            1.   Land;
            2.   Buildings and building improvements;
            3.   Machinery and equipment:
               a.   Vehicles;
               b.   Off-road equipment (backhoes, chipper, front end-loader);
               c.   Office equipment;
               d.   Computer equipment all hardware, upgrades and software; and
               e.   Minor equipment and tools.
            4.   Improvements other than buildings:
               a.   Water main improvements; and
               b.   Other enterprise fund infrastructure improvements.
            5.   Construction work in progress.
         (b)   Category descriptions.
            1.   Land. Includes all land purchased or otherwise acquired by the
village. All costs for legal services incidental to the acquisitions and other
charges incurred in preparing the land for use should be included in the cost
of the land. If land and a building are acquired as a single parcel, the value
of the land should be determined separately from the building and only that
amount carried in the Land Account.
            2.   Building and building improvements. The building is valued at
purchase price or construction cost. The cost should include all charges
applicable to the building, including broker’s or architect’s fees and interest
on borrowed money during construction. Additions and improvements to buildings
as well as the cost of the heating and ventilating system or other permanently
attached fixtures should be added to the Building Account. Improvements enhance
the value of the building and cannot be removed from the building without
impact to the structure.
            3.   Machinery and equipment. The Machinery and Equipment Account
should consist of property that does not lose its identity when removed from
its location and is not changed materially or expended in use. These assets
should be recorded at cost, including freight, installation and other charges
incurred to place the asset in use.
            4.   Improvements other than buildings. Values for other
improvements can be recorded on a cost-of-construction basis including
engineering and other professional fees incidental to the project. Improvements
do not include landscaping, grading or movable equipment.
            5.   Construction work in progress. This category is utilized for a
building or other capital construction projects that are incomplete as of the
fiscal year end. When the project is complete, the cumulative costs are
transferred to another appropriate fixed asset category.
      (3)   Infrastructure assets. Infrastructure assets acquired will be
included in the Fixed Asset Account Group, and included in the inventory of
village assets. Infrastructure assets, including roads, bridges, curbs and
gutters, and streets and sidewalks shall be capitalized.
      (4)   Leased assets. All village assets acquired by a capital lease shall
be treated as a village owned asset and included in the property record report
based on the criteria established in this policy. Typically assets acquired
through an operating lease are returned to the lessor at the end of the lease
term and are not deemed to be owned by the village.
   (C)   Acquiring a fixed asset. All fixed assets are acquired in accordance
with the village budget and purchasing policy manual. When a fixed asset is
acquired the department head shall prepare Form A, Acquisition/Fixed Asset, and
remit the form to finance. All costs incurred with making the asset usable
should be included as a cost of the asset.
   (D)   Valuation of assets.
      (1)   Purchased property shall be valued at cost where historical records
are available and at an estimated historical value where no historical records
exist.
      (2)   Donated fixed assets are recorded at appraised fair market value at
the time of acquisition. Assets estimated to have a value in excess of $5,000
must be appraised by a person knowledgeable and qualified with respect to that
type of asset.
      (3)   All land or building acquisitions with an estimated value in excess
of $5,000 must be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser.
      (4)   Assets acquired through leases meeting the capitalization
requirements of the FASB’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SPAS)
No. 13, Accounting for Leases, should be recorded at the net present value of
future minimum lease payments. Typically, these are fixed assets that transfer
ownership of the property to the village by the end of the lease term.
      (5)   Assets acquired by the exercise of eminent domain powers shall be
capitalized in the General Fixed Asset Account Group in the amount of
compensation awarded the property owner plus legal service costs incidental to
the acquisition.
   (E)   Retirements of fixed assets.
      (1)   Assets are typically retired for three reasons: obsolescence, sale
or trade, and theft or loss. In general, the village’s practice is to exhaust
the usefulness of its assets before disposition. However, assets may be sold or
traded-in when it is in the best interest of the village to do so.
      (2)   Property may not be transferred, traded-in or disposed of without
prior approval of the department head and the Village Administrator.
         (a)   A Form R-Retirement should be completed by the department head
and a copy sent to finance for all retirements of fixed assets.
         (b)   Obsolescence is the decrease in the value of fixed assets,
resulting from economic, social, technological or legal change.
         (c)   Assets that are surplus shall be discarded, used for parts, or
sold at the end of its useful life but are not intended to be replaced. Form R-
Retirement shall be completed when the asset is declared surplus.
         (d)   Property which is declared as surplus, obsolete or unserviceable
should be accompanied by a statement prepared by a person knowledgeable
regarding the specific equipment.
         (e)   Assets that are not unserviceable or obsolete must be sold by
competitive sale, negotiated sale or auction. Any other method of retirement of
assets with a value equal to or in excess of $500 at the time of disposal shall
be approved by the Village Board and assets with a value less than $500 at the
time of disposal shall be approved by the Village Administrator.
         (f)   Assets missing due to theft, loss or destroyed during use shall
be reported on Form R-Retirement with an explanation of the circumstances for
the loss.
         (g)   If an item is held in storage all appropriate documentation
shall be remitted to Finance.
   (F)   Transfers and modifications to fixed assets.
      (1)   Transfer of a fixed asset to another village department must be
approved by the Village Administrator and the receiving department head. The
receiving department head should prepare Form T-Transfer.
      (2)   Additions and betterments to village assets should be reported on
Form M-Modifications. Additions or betterments to existing fixed assets should
significantly prolong a fixed asset’s economic life or expand its usefulness in
order to be capitalized. Normal repairs that merely maintain the asset in its
present condition should be recorded as an expenditure/expense and not
capitalized.
   (G)   Depreciation of enterprise fund fixed assets.
      (1)   Depreciation is used to reflect the economic loss in the value of
an asset. The method used should reflect the actual occurrence of economical
loss as it takes place over the projected life of an asset. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires that the method used to allocate the cost
of a capital asset over its estimated useful life be as equitable as possible
to the periods during which services are obtained from the use of the asset.
      (2)   In most cases, the straight line method of depreciation will be
used for all capitalized assets. However, this policy does not preclude the use
of another method of depreciation that can be substantiated as reasonable for
specific types of assets. A change in the method of calculating depreciation
for assets already placed in service and partially depreciated shall be
reviewed by the village audit firm.
      (3)   The procedure for calculating depreciation in the year of
acquisition is the recording of one-half year of the first year’s depreciation.
Conversely, one-half of the depreciation expense is recorded in the year of
retirement.
      (4)   The estimated useful lives of fixed assets for the purpose of
depreciation are found in schedule MU entitled Estimating Useful Life For
Capital Assets.
   (H)   Physical inventory of controllable and fixed assets.
      (1)   Inventories are physical reviews and confirmations of the village’s
assets. A periodic evaluation of the inventory will ensure the integrity of the
amounts in the financial statements, maintain current insurance valuations and
assist in loss detection.
      (2)   Inventories shall be conducted as follows:
         (a)   Land and buildings every five years;
         (b)   Improvements other than buildings every five years;
         (c)   Machinery and equipment every three years; and
         (d)   Controlled assets every three years.
   (I)   Accounting for fixed assets.
      (1)   Investment in general fixed assets. Fixed assets, except
infrastructure assets, acquired with funds from general, special revenue or
capital projects funds are accounted for in the General Fixed Asset Account
Group.
      (2)   Enterprise fund assets. Assets purchased with funds from an
Enterprise Fund (Water/Sewer, Garbage) are accounted for in the specific
Enterprise Fund with the proper allocation of depreciation.
      (3)   Multi-funded assets. Assets purchased with money from two or more
separate funds shall be shown as a percentage owned by each fund based on a
reasonable method such as percentage of usage or amount of cost contributed.
      (4)   Source of funds:
         (a)   General Operating Fund;
         (b)   Water/Sewer Operating Fund;
         (c)   Water/Sewer Capital Fund;
         (d)   Motor Fuel Tax Fund;
         (e)   Parks Fund;
         (f)   Capital Construction Fund;
         (g)   Phase I Fund;
         (h)   Special Assessment Fund; and
         (i)   Village Hall Fund.
   (J)   Interest capitalization for constructed fixed assets. When a
government chooses to construct a fixed asset for an enterprise fund, a
significant accounting issue that arises is the calculation of interest to be
capitalized. Guidance on the capitalization of interest is contained in two
FASB pronouncements: SFAS No. 62, Capitalization of Interest Costs in
Situations Involving Certain Tax-Exempt Borrowings and Certain Gifts and Grants
and SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost.
   (K)   Reports. Annual reports shall be prepared by the Village Auditor at
the end of each fiscal year showing the fixed assets by: class; source of
funding; and function and activity. Each year, Finance will update the property
record report and prepare the depreciation expense.
   (L)   Policy. A fixed asset inventory is herein established to ensure
compliance with reporting standards and to safeguard village assets. Fixed
assets shall include land, buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles with a
useful life of five years or more and having an original cost of at least $500.

(Ord. 834, passed 10-18-2006)
§ 31.03 INVESTMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Investment policy. It is always prudent for any public unit to have an
investment policy in place for the purpose of maximum security of public funds,
equitably distributing the investments and maximizing income of the
governmental unit. The following policy is adopted for the Village Treasurer’s
office.
   (B)   Scope of investment policy. This investment policy applies to all
funds under the ownership, management and control of the village. This
investment policy will apply to all existing and any new funds or temporary
funds. All funds shall be placed under the management and control of the
Village Treasurer. In the event this policy conflicts with any federal or state
laws or regulations, including but not limited to the Public Funds Investment
Act (ILCS Ch. 30, Act 235, § 2.5), the federal or state laws or regulations
shall apply. In all other events, this policy shall apply.
   (C)   Objectives.
      (1)   The purpose of this investment policy is to establish a cash
management and investment guideline for the stewardship of public funds under
the jurisdiction of the Village Treasurer.
      (2)   The specific objectives of this investment policy shall be as
follows:
         (a)   Safety of principal;
         (b)   Diversity of investments to avoid unreasonable risks;
         (c)   The portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all
operating costs which may be reasonably anticipated;
         (d)   Obtaining the highest interest rate available while ensuring the
maximum safety of principal, which is left to the discretion of the Village
Treasurer, including the decision whether or not the Village Treasurer will
require collateralization of any deposits;
         (e)   In maintaining its investment portfolio, the Village Treasurer
shall avoid any transaction that might impair public confidence in the Village
Treasurer’s office;
         (f)   The Village Treasurer will first give consideration to Elwood
financial institutions that have positive community relations involvement in
determining the financial institution to be used as a depository;
         (g)   All funds will be invested for a period of one day or longer,
depending on the requirement for the disbursement of funds; and
         (h)   All funds shall be deposited within two working days at
prevailing rates or better in accordance with Illinois statutory law.
   (D)   Responsibility. All investment of funds under the control of the
Village Treasurer is the direct responsibility of the Village Treasurer. The
Village Treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions and shall establish
a system of controls for all authorized subordinates who are directly involved
in the assistance of the investment activities.
   (E)   Accounting. All investment transactions shall be recorded by the
Village Treasurer of the village staff at least monthly, listing all active
investments. This report will be made available to the Village Board of
Trustees.
   (F)   Financial institutions. The Board of Trustees will have the
responsibility to select which financial institutions will be depositories for
the Village of Elwood funds.
      (1)   The Village Treasurer will take into consideration security, size,
location, condition, service fees and the community relations involvement of

PROFESSIONAL FEE AGREEMENT
This Professional Fee Agreement (“Agreement”) is made and entered into this
________day of ________________, 20______, by and between the Village of
Elwood, an Illinois Municipal Corporation (“Village”) and
______________________ (“Applicant”) for the project known as________
_______________________________________________________:
[insert legal description, if applicable].
WITNESSETH:
   WHEREAS, the Applicant intends to secure Village approval of its proposed
project; and
   WHEREAS, it will, therefore, be necessary for the Village to engage its
independent professional staff or consultants to review and comment upon the
work of the Applicant and its professionals; and
   WHEREAS, the fees for said professional staff in completing their review
work for the Village shall be paid by the Applicant.
   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and contained, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, IT IS MUTUALLY COVENANTED AND AGREED by, among and between
the respective parties hereto as follows:
SECTION 1. PROFESSIONAL FEES.
   The Applicant shall pay to the Village any and all professional fees and
expenses incurred by the Village in conjunction with the Applicant’s project
from the date of this Agreement through completion of the project as determined
by the Village, i.e. Village’s acceptance of all public improvements associated
with the project, whichever occurs last. Professional fees and expenses shall
include, but not be limited to services provided in legal, planning,
engineering, traffic, financial and other disciplines necessitated by the
project. Fees shall also include, but are not limited to, all time associated
with review, analysis, discussions, meetings, inspections, planning and other
work or services performed on behalf of the Village in conjunction with the
project.
SECTION 2. SECURITY.
   Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, the Applicant shall post
with the Village as security for payment herein the following amount(s) which
is/are dependent on the size of the project:
 
SIZE OF DEVELOPMENT  SECURITY
10 acres or less     $3,000
11 acres to 99 acres $8,000

   The Village is expressly authorized to apply this security in payment of
such fees, costs and expenses in the event the Applicant fails to make payments
as described in Section 3 of this Agreement. The Applicant acknowledges and
agrees to continuously maintain this amount of deposit with the Village until
completion of the project.
   Applicant acknowledges and agrees that some projects, which are not directly
related to land development or which are unique by nature in complexity or
simplicity, may require the posting of security in such other reasonable
amounts as the Village may require in its sole discretion. In the event that
any amount of the security posted herein remains on deposit at the completion
of the project, the Village shall cause such unnecessary security to be
returned to the Applicant within 60 days of completion of the project and
payment of all expense to the professional staff or consultants.
SECTION 3. PAYMENT.
   The Village shall provide the Applicant with timely invoices itemizing the
fees and the work performed. The Applicant shall pay the Village within 30 days
of the date of the invoice from the Village. If the Applicant does not pay the
statement within the 30 day period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance
at rate of 18% per annum. The Village may also, following written notification
to the Applicant, direct that all professional staff and Village Officials
cease work on the project until the invoice is paid in full. If the Applicant
has progressed to the stage where building or occupancy permits are being
issued, such permits may be withheld until all fees are paid to the
satisfaction of the Village.
SECTION 4. COOPERATION.
   The Applicant shall provide reasonable cooperation to the Village, its
officials and independent professional staff with respect to the review of its
project and Applicant’s performance thereunder.
SECTION 5. REPRESENTATION OF VILLAGE ONLY.
   The Applicant also acknowledges that the independent professional staff or
consultants solely represent the Village and its interest and do not represent
the Applicant.
SECTION 6. CONFLICT.
   If the terms and provisions of this Agreement conflict with any ordinance of
the Village or agreement between the parties, the terms and provisions of the
Professional Fee Agreement shall supersede, set and control any other terms or
provisions.
SECTION 7. ATTORNEY FEES.
   In the event any suit or action is brought to enforce or otherwise affects
this Agreement or any of its provisions, the Applicant, shall pay the Village’s
attorney and expert witness fees, costs and expenses associated with such
litigation.
SECTION 8. SEVERABILITY.
   The invalidity of any paragraph or subparagraph of this Agreement shall not
impair the validity of any other paragraph or subparagraph. If any provision of
this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
determined severable and the Agreement may be enforced with such provision
severed or as modified by such court.
SECTION 9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
   This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding between the
parties and there are not other agreements, representations, warranties or
understandings, oral or written between the parties with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement. No alteration, modification, amendment or change of
this Agreement shall be valid unless by written instrument.

§ 31.07 OFFICIAL POLICY; FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.
   (A)   Incorporation. The preambles to this section be, and the same hereby
are incorporated by this reference as if set out in full at this place.
   (B)   Adoption. It shall be the policy of the village that all requests
pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 140) shall
be submitted and processed in accordance with the document attached hereto and
incorporated herewith as Exhibit “A”.
   (C)   Freedom of Information Act; requests to the village.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   The Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is the means by
which the general public may access public records in possession of the
village. It is the public policy of the State of Illinois that “all persons are
entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of the
government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them as
public officials and public employees...” Some records are, however, exempt
from public review and these exemptions are permitted by the statute. The Act
is not intended to be used to violate individual privacy, nor for the purpose
of furthering a commercial enterprise.
         (b)   This request procedure generally requires the village to respond
to the request within seven working days.
         (c)   The village may give notice of an extension of time for an
additional seven days under specific circumstances.
         (d)   Denial shall be communicated by letter and failure to respond to
a written request within seven working days after its receipt shall be
considered a denial of a request.
         (e)   Decisions to deny, in whole or in part, any requests for
information may be appealed to the Village Clerk by sending a written notice of
appeal within seven working days from the date of receipt of the denial. The
notice of appeal must be in writing and include a copy of the original request.
         (f)   Beyond inspection of the documents, the village is permitted by
statute to charge fees for copying and/or certification of these records.
         (g)   Exemption from or reduction of these charges is permitted upon
request to the Village Clerk if the specific purpose for the request indicates
that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest.
         (h)   Public interest exists if the principal purpose of the request
is to access information regarding the health, safety, welfare or the legal
rights of the general public, and not for the principal purpose of personal or
commercial benefit.
      (2)   Guidelines for submitting a formal request for information.
         (a)   Requests for public records shall be submitted to the Village
Clerk by completion of the Freedom of Information Act request form available at
the Village Clerk’s office or online at the village website (http://
www.villageofelwood.com).
         (b)   The request must include:
            1.   The requestor’s full name, address and daytime telephone
number;
            2.   A description of the requested records. (Be as specific as
possible with regards to the documents or information requested, including
dates and the department, board or commission from which the information is
being sought); and
            3.   Whether the request is for inspection of records, copies of
records or both.
      (3)   Additional supplement for request for police records.
         (a)   In addition to the information provided on the Freedom of
Information Request Procedures and Request Form, this supplement addresses
specific requests for public records pertaining to the Village Police
Department. The Illinois Freedom of Information Act does require government
entities, such as the Police Department, to provide access to public records
with acknowledgment of applicable exemptions for protection of the privacy of
personal information, witnesses and/or protection of ongoing criminal
investigations.
         (b)   Note that copies of accident reports involving crime or death
are subject to the statutory exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act
also (see ILCS Ch. 5, Act 140, § 7). Dissemination of police related public
records, as with other public records provided under the Act, are for the
principal purpose of the public interest so that citizens may make informed
political judgments and monitor the government to ensure that it is being
conducted in the public interest.
         (c)   Police related records that may be available include:
            1.   Minutes or transcripts of public meetings;
            2.   Monthly reports of the Chief of Police to the Police Board,
which include crime statistics, complaint statistics and general orders issued;
            3.   Traffic tickets;
            4.   Accident reports;
            5.   Property reports involving lost or stolen property; and
            6.   Sealed drawings of accident/crime scenes.
         (d)   Important: Please note the fees charged for copies requested or
made during inspection.
         (e)   Please complete the freedom of information request form for the
village and detail what specific police records you are requesting, including
known dates, times, locations and/or outcomes. Return to the village and follow
the instructions provided under the procedures section.

§ 31.08 PROCEDURES FOR CHARGING VIOLATIONS; PAYMENT.
   (A)   Incorporation. The preambles to this section be, and the same hereby
are incorporated by this reference as if set out in full at this place.
   (B)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a system for fair,
effective and efficient enforcement of certain municipal ordinance violations
as provided by law. It is intended that certain ordinance violations may be
resolved prior to filing a charging instrument in the Will County Circuit Court
by payment of minimum fines to the Village Clerk or Village Treasurer.
   (C)   Procedures established.
      (1)   Ordinance violations subject to expedited procedures. The village
hereby adopts an expedited procedure for disposition of certain ordinance
violations, which shall initially consist of those ordinances set forth in
“Ordinance Violations Minimum Fines” attached to the ordinance codified herein
and incorporated herewith.
      (2)   Issuance of notice of ordinance violation. The Village
Administrator and the Chief of Police or their designees are duly authorized
hereby to issue notice of ordinance violations to persons accused of violating
any of the ordinance(s) or regulation(s). Each day that the violation shall
continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
      (3)   Establishment of minimum fines. The minimum fines applicable to
ordinance violations subject to the expedited procedures are set forth in the
ordinance codified herein. For purposes of this section, the ordinance codified
herein may be amended to incorporate additional municipal ordinances and/or
modify the minimum fine amounts without further formal action by the corporate
authorities provided that any amendment shall be approved by the Village
President in written form.
      (4)   Contents of notice of ordinance violation.
         (a)   The form of the citation shall provide notice to the defendant
of the option to settle in lieu of filing a charging instrument with the County
Circuit Court by payment of the minimum fine set forth in the ordinance
codified herein if payment is made in full and within the time limit and manner
set forth in this section.
         (b)   The notice of ordinance violation shall also contain, but shall
not be limited to, the following information:
            1.   The date, time and place of the violation;
            2.   The particular ordinance violated;
            3.   The vehicle make and state registration number, if applicable;
            4.   The common street address of the dwelling or structure, if
applicable;
            5.   The minimum fine amount;
            6.   The identification number of the person issuing the notice and
his or her signature.
            7.   Information as to the availability of a court hearing at which
the alleged violator may appear in person and contest the violation notice on
its merits and the time and place in which the hearing may be heard;
            8.   The date, time and place of a court hearing at which the
violation may be contested on its merits or a statement that the person will be
notified of a hearing time; and
            9.   Payment of the indicated fine shall operate as a final
disposition of the violation.
      (5)   Settlement and payment of minimum fine. A person accused of
violating a municipal ordinance may offer to resolve the ordinance violation by
full payment of the minimum fine which is set forth in the ordinance codified
herein if payment is made within the time and in the manner set forth in
division (C)(6) below or within an extended period of time authorized by the
Village Administrator or her designee. In no event shall the Village Clerk or
Village Treasurer accept partial payments of the minimum fine.
      (6)   Time limit for settlement in lieu of court appearance. Payments in
settlement of ordinance violations set forth in the ordinance codified herein
shall be made within 15 days after the date that the notice of ordinance
violation was issued to the person accused of the violation. The Village
Administrator or her designee may extend the time period within which to make
payment in settlement of the ordinance violation. A payment shall be considered
made within the 15 days if the payment is actually received by the Village
Clerk or Village Treasurer within the 15-day period. Payments shall be made by
cash or certified check, money order or cashier’s check made payable to the
village.
      (7)   Delay of filing. The Village Administrator or the Chief of Police
shall have authority to delay the filing of the charging instrument with the
County Circuit Clerk in order to allow the accused person additional time to
resolve the ordinance violation by payment of the prescribed fine. Provided,
however, in no event shall the violator’s first appearance date in court extend
beyond 60 days from the date that the notice of ordinance was issued for
violations of municipal ordinances regulating vehicles.
      (8)   Rejection of settlement and payment of fine. If the Village Clerk
or Treasurer receives a payment after the time and date that the charging
instrument is filed with the County Circuit Clerk, payment and settlement of
the violation(s) shall be refused and/or rejected and the village shall proceed
to prosecute the ordinance violation with the County Circuit Court.
      (9)   Acceptance of settlement and any such minimum fine. If a person
makes payment in full of the minimum fine in full pursuant to this section,
then the village shall not proceed to file and/or prosecute a notice of
ordinance violation with the County Circuit Court. However, acceptance of the
payment in full by the village shall not bar or stop it from proceeding with
any other remedy available for the actual violation or any separate offense
unless expressly waived in writing.
      (10)   Collection and recordation of accepted fine. The Village Clerk or
Treasurer shall account and report all receipts of fines collected hereunder to
the Village Administrator and/or the Chief of Police. The Village Administrator
or his or her designee and the Chief of Police shall maintain complete and
accurate records of dispositions made hereunder.
      (11)   Minimum fines. Exhibit “A”, minimum fines, which is attached to
the ordinance codified herein, is adopted and incorporated as part of this code
of ordinances as fully as if set out at length herein.

   (B)   Adoption. It shall be the policy of the village to establish and
implement a returned check collection policy in accordance with the financial
policy set forth in division (D) below and incorporated herewith.
   (C)   Amendment. The Village Administrator is hereby granted authority to
amend the returned check collection policy and/or any forms created for the
implementation thereof as deemed necessary, expedient and in the best interest
of the village without further action by the corporate authorities. Any such
amendment shall be made in writing and published by the Village Clerk as the
official returned check collection policy for the village.
   (D)   Returned check collection policy.
      (1)   Check cashing. All checks exchanged for village goods and services
are to be made payable to the village.
      (2)   Returned check policy. In an effort to streamline and improve
collections on checks returned unpaid, the following guidelines and procedures
are hereby established: each check issued to the village shall only be
presented to the village depository on one occasion. The village shall not re-
deposit any check returned unpaid for any reason (including but not limited to
“non-sufficient funds,” “account closed” or “stop payment”).
      (3)   Service charge. The village shall assess a standard fee of $25 for
each returned check, in accordance with applicable statute. This fee shall be
payable to the village in addition to the face value of the check issued.
      (4)   Collection procedures.
         (a)   Upon notice of a returned check, the Village Administrator or
other authorized officer or staff member shall issue a written demand for
payment within 30 days. The letter shall be sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested and contain the following information:
            1.   The check number;
            2.   Date of check;
            3.   Amount of the check;
            4.   Total amount due; and
            5.   Instruction that payment shall be accepted only in the form of
cash, certified check, credit card or money order, and that payment must be
made in full.
         (b)   If the payor fails to remit payment on the returned check within
the 30-day period, the matter will be referred to legal counsel for further
collection procedures. If the returned check represents payment for water and
sewer services, disconnection procedures will begin after the 30-day period has
expired, and a reconnection fee will be charged in accordance with the then
current utility billing and collection procedures. In the event the matter is
referred to legal counsel, payor shall be responsible for reasonable attorney
fees and costs of collection, in addition to all other sums due.
         (c)   If a customer presents two returned checks in a one-year period,
the village will only accept future payment for goods or services from that
customer in the form of cash, certified check, credit card or money payment,
unless it is otherwise deemed prudent to do so by the village administration,
in its sole discretion.

§ 31.10 PUBLIC PROJECTS CONSTRUCTION CHANGE ORDER POLICY.
   (A)   Incorporation. The preambles to the ordinance codified in this section
are hereby adopted and incorporated by this reference as if fully set out in
this section.
   (B)   Adoption. It shall be the policy of the village to establish and
implement a construction change order policy in substantial conformance with
the policy det forth in division (D) of this section.
   (C)   Amendment. The Village Administrator, in consultation with the Village
President and the Finance Committee, is hereby granted authority to amend the
construction change order policy and/or any forms created for the
implementation thereof as deemed necessary, expedient and in the best interest
of the village without further action by the Corporate Authorities. Any such
amendment shall be made in writing and published by the Village Clerk as the
official construction change order policy of the Village of Elwood.
   (D)   Policy.
      (1)   The Village President and Board of Trustees for the Village (the
Corporate Authorities) have the authority and responsibility to approve all
public projects, including construction projects (projects) within the village
where the aggregate expense for the project shall exceed $20,000, pursuant to
its Procurement Ordinance (Ordinance 853). From time to time, it becomes
necessary to revise the scope or terms of those projects through the use of
change orders. In some instances, the change order will reduce the total
project cost to the village. More frequently, however, the change order will
require additional public funding. This policy has been established in order to
insure that the Corporate Authorities have the necessary information and
sufficient funds to approve any changes to the project and the additional cost,
if any.
      (2)   Once it is determined by the Village Engineer(s), Village Planner
(s) or other staff that a change order is necessary, village staff shall notify
the Village Treasurer in writing. The Treasurer will review the original
project price and the expenses and encumbrances incurred to date. The Treasurer
will then prepare a financial change order report (the report). The report
shall include the following information:
         (a)   The funding status of the project;
         (b)   The revenue source for funding the project;
         (c)   A determination of whether the budgeted revenue source has funds
sufficient to cover the proposed change order; and
         (d)   A conclusion that if the original funding source cannot meet the
amount required for the proposed change order, then alternate funding options
will be outlined in the report.
      (3)   Where approval of the change order does not require Village Board
approval pursuant to Ordinance 853, the Village Administrator may approve the
proposed funding method, execute the change order, and authorize appropriate
changes to the financial statements and budget document. If the proposed change
order requires Village Board approval the changes will be made only after
formal action is taken by the Board.
      (4)   Periodically, a change in a project will necessitate emergency
action and a change order may be executed in an expedited manner, provided that
there is an urgent and immediate necessity to act. In such cases the foregoing
procedures will be followed to determine the source of funding for the change
order after its administrative authorization has been reported to the Village
Board, in accordance with the requirements contained in Ordinance 853.
      (5)   In all cases, the Treasurer shall make the appropriate changes to
the operating budget and financial statements after approval.

§ 31.11 PREPARING AND UPDATING DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   It is in the best interest of the village to adopt a policy and

responsibilities under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
   (B)   The Policies and Procedures for Preparing and Updating Disclosures
attached as Exhibit A to Ord. 1117 be and is hereby adopted by the Village of
Elwood as its official policies and procedures for preparing and updating
disclosures.

IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
§ 31.25 OBJECTIVE.
   The purpose of this Identity Theft Prevention Program (Program) is to
protect customers of the Village of Elwood’s utility services from identity
theft. The Program is intended to establish reasonable policies and procedures
to facilitate the detection, prevention and mitigation of identity theft in
connection with the opening of new covered accounts and activity on existing
covered accounts.
(Ord. 925, passed 10-15-2008)
§ 31.26 SCOPE.
   This Program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the
village (water, sewer, and refuse) by any and all personnel of the village,
including management personnel. This Program does not replace or repeal any
previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all of the
activities that are the subject of this Program, but rather it is intended to
supplement any such existing policies and programs.
(Ord. 925, passed 10-15-2008)

   (A)   When used in this subchapter, the following terms have the meanings
assigned to them herein, unless the context clearly requires that the term be
given a different meaning:
      COVERED ACCOUNT. An account that the Village of Elwood offers or
maintains, primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves
or is designed to permit multiple payments of transactions (16 C.F.R. § 681.2

there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to the village or its customers from
identity theft (16 C.F.R. § 681.2(b)(3)(ii)).
      IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,

government issued driver’s license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number.
Additional examples of IDENTIFYING INFORMATION are set forth in 16 C.F.R. §
603.2(a).
      IDENTITY THEFT. A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority (16 C.F.R. § 681.2(b)(8) and 16
C.F.R. § 603.2(a)).
      RED FLAG. A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   (B)   Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the

the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.), as amended
by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-159).
(Ord. 925, passed 10-15-2008)
§ 31.28 POLICY.
   (A)   Administration of the Program. Issues to be addressed in the annual
Identity Theft Prevention Report include:
      (1)   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts
and activity with respect to existing covered accounts;
      (2)   Service provider arrangements;
      (3)   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management’s
response; and
      (4)   Recommendations for material changes to the Program, if needed for
improvement.
   (B)   Identity theft prevention elements.
      (1)   Identification of relevant red flags. The Village of Elwood has
considered the guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags
from the FTC’s Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the village’s past history
with instances of identity theft, if any. The village hereby determines that
the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this Program given the
relative size of the village and the limited nature and scope of the services
that the village provides to its citizens:
         (a)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers:
            1.   A fraud or active duly alert is included with a consumer
report or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
            2.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze
in response to a request for a consumer report.
            3.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in § 681.1 (b) of the FTC’s Identity Theft Rules.
            4.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
               a.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of
inquiries;
               b.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
               c.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
               d.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for
abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
         (b)   The presentation of suspicious documents:
            1.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been
altered or forged.
            2.   The photograph or physical description on the identification
is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting
the identification.
            3.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
            4.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the village, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
            5.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or
gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
         (c)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change:
            1.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the village. For example:
               a.   The address does not match any address in the consumer
report or CRA ID Check response; or
               b.   The Social Security Number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File.
            2.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
            3.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the village. For example:
               a.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
               b.   The phone number on an application is the same as the
number provided on a fraudulent application.
            4.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type
commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-
party sources used by the village. For example:
               a.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
               b.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager
or answering service.
            5.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other
persons opening an account or other customers.
            6.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
            7.   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails
to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or
in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
            8.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent
with personal identifying information that is on file with the village.
            9.   If the village uses challenge questions, the person opening
the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating information
beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or consumer
report.
         (d)   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
            1.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the village receives a request for the addition of authorized
users on the account.
            2.   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known patterns of fraud. For example: the customer fails to make the first
payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
            3.   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
            4.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account,
the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
            5.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although usage of utility products or services continues in
connection with the customer’s covered account.
            6.   The village is notified that the customer is not receiving
paper account statements.
            7.   The village is notified of unauthorized usage of utility
products or services in connection with a customer’s covered account.
         (e)   Notice of possible identity theft. The village is notified by a
customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any other
person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity
theft.
      (2)   Detection of red flags.
         (a)   The employees of the Village of Elwood that interact directly
with customers on a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for
monitoring the information and documentation provided by the customer and any
third-party service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and
the modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might
be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
this Program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this Program shall not open a new account
for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer
with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained so that they can recognize the relevant red
flags identified in this Program and exercise sound judgment in connection with
the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in
connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of
an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the
final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
         (b)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer’s identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. The policy shall be generally
consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31
C.F.R. § 103.121) implementing § 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act but need not be
as detailed. The Program Administrator
shall establish from time to time a written policy setting forth the manner in
which customers with existing accounts shall establish their identity before
being allowed to make modifications to or otherwise gain access to existing
accounts.
      (3)   Response to detected red flags.
         (a)   If the responsible employees of the Village of Elwood as set
forth in division (2) above are unable, after making a good faith effort, to
form a reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer
attempting to open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing
account based on the information and documentation provided by the customer and
any third-party service provider, the village shall not open the new account or
modify or otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the village
and shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
         (b)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer’s account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
            1.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
            2.   Contacting the customer.
            3.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security
devices that permit access to a covered account.
            4.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
            5.   Not opening a new covered account.
            6.   Closing an existing covered account.
            7.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling
a covered account to a debt collector.
            8.   Notifying law enforcement.
            9.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.

§ 31.29 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
   (A)   Initial risk assessment - covered accounts. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of COVERED ACCOUNT in the FTC’s Identity Theft Rules. Therefore, the
Village of Elwood determines that with respect to its residential utility
accounts it offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The village also
performed an initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or
maintains any other accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks
to customers or the utility from identity theft. In making this determination
the village considered: (1) The methods it uses to open its accounts; (2) The
methods it uses to access its accounts; and (3) Its previous experience with
identity theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such
other covered accounts.
   (B)   Program updates - risk assessment. The Program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
Program update include:
      (1)   An assessment of the risk factors identified above;
      (2)   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures;
      (3)   Changes in methods of identity theft;
      (4)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft;
and
      (5)   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   (C)   Training and oversight. All staff and third-party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
   (D)   Other legal requirements. Awareness of the following related legal
requirements should be maintained:
      (1)   31 U.S.C. 5318 (g): Reporting of suspicious activities;
      (2)   15 U.S.C. 1681 c-1 (h): Identity theft prevention; Fraud alerts and
active duty alerts - limitations on use of information for credit extensions;
      (3)   15 U.S.C. 1681 s-2: Responsibilities of furnishers of information
to consumer reporting agencies; and
      (4)   15 U.S.C. 1681 (m): Requirements on use of consumer reports.
(Ord. 925, passed 10-15-2008)
§ 31.30 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention
Program shall be by ordinance of the Village Board. Thereafter, changes to the
Program of a day-to-day operational character and decisions relating to the
interpretation and implementation of the Program may be made by the Village
Administrator (Program Administrator). Major changes or shifts of policy
positions under the Program shall only be made by the Village Board.
   (B)   Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the
Program will be the responsibility of the Program Administrator. The Program
Administrator may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to
administer the Program. The Program Administrator shall be the head of any such
committee. The Program Administrator will report at least annually to the
Village Board regarding compliance with this subchapter.

retail from a retailer;
      (2)   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or
receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a
rate of 3.5% of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this division, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on the event, shall be
allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in such
other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
state or local tax in this state; and
      (3)   The tax imposed by this section is not imposed on the act or
privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the
municipality.
   (D)   Collection of tax by retailers.
      (1)   The tax authorized by section shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by the retailer to the Department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this section and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the Department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this section shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for the sale at
retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the Department in the
manner provided by the Department.
      (2)   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this section shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the pass charge
for telecommunications.
   (E)   Returns to Department. On or before the last day of February, 2003,
and on or before the last day of every month thereafter, the tax imposed under
this section on telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate
forms and information as required by the Department pursuant to the Illinois
Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (Public Act 92-526, § 5-50),
being ILCS Ch. 35, Act 636, §§ 5-1 et seq. and any accompanying rules and
regulations created by the Department to implement the Act.
   (F)   Resellers.
      (1)   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to
be a reseller of those telecommunications, that person shall apply to the
Department for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts which will show
the Department why the applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this
section(6) on any of those purchases and shall furnish additional information
as the Department may reasonably require.
      (2)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a
resale number to the applicant and shall certify that number to the applicant.
The Department may cancel any number which is obtained through
misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive the telecommunication
tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer
applies because of the person’s having discontinued the making of resales.
      (3)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall
not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person
has an active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to
the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to the
person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

      (3)   Pursuant to ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-2, Ord. 368 of the Village

      (4)   The provisions of this division (A) shall not be effective until

   (B)   Exceptions. None of the taxes authorized by this section may be
imposed with respect to any transaction in interstate commerce or otherwise to
the extent to which the business or privilege may not, under the constitution
and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this
state or any political subdivision thereof, nor shall any persons engaged in
the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing or selling or transmitting
gas, water or electricity, or engaged in the business of transmitting messages,
or using or consuming electricity acquired in a purchase at retail, be subject
to taxation under the provisions of this section for those transactions that
are or may become subject to taxation under the provisions of the “Municipal
Retailer’s Occupation Tax Act” as authorized by ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 8-11-1;
nor shall any tax authorized by this section be imposed upon any person engaged
in a business or on any privilege unless the tax is imposed in like manner and

the municipality, whether privately or municipally owned or operated, or
exercising the same privilege within the municipality.
   (C)   Additional taxes. The tax shall be in addition to other taxes levied
upon the taxpayer or its business.
   (D)   Collection. The tax authorized by this section shall be collected from
the purchaser by the person maintaining a place of business in this state who
delivers the electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of
the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser. This
tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the
electricity to the purchaser and if unpaid, is recoverable in the same manner
as the original charge for delivering the electricity, provided that the person
delivering electricity shall be allowed a credit for the tax related to
deliveries of electricity the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible, and provided further, that if the charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit the tax. Any tax
required to be collected pursuant to this division (D) and any such tax
collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt owed to
the municipality by that person delivering the electricity. Persons delivering
electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding the tax to the
gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons delivering electricity
shall also be authorized to add to the gross charge an amount equal to three
percent of the tax to reimburse the person delivering electricity for the
expense incurred in keeping records, billing customers, preparing and filing
returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the municipality upon request.
If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
municipality in the manner prescribed by the municipality. The person
delivering electricity who files returns pursuant to this section shall, at the
time of filing the return, pay the municipality the amount of the tax collected
pursuant to this division (D).
   (E)   Reports to municipality.
      (1)   On or before the last day of each month, each taxpayer who has not
paid the tax imposed by this section to a person delivering electricity as set
forth in division (D) above and who is not otherwise exempted from paying the
tax shall make a return to the Village Treasurer for the preceding month
stating:
         (a)   His or her name;
         (b)   His or her principal place of business;
         (c)   His or her gross receipts and/or kilowatt-hour usage during the
month upon the basis of which the tax is imposed;
         (d)   Amount of tax; and
         (e)   Other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
      (2)   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the
time of making the return, pay to the village, the amount of tax herein
imposed; provided that in connection with any return, the taxpayer may, if he
or she so elects, report and pay an amount based upon his or her total billings
of business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amount previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later
payments based upon any differences between the billings, and the taxable gross
receipts.
   (F)   Credit for overpayment. If it shall appear that an amount of tax has
been paid which was not due under the provisions of this section, whether as
the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then that amount shall be
credited against any tax due, or to become due under this section from the
taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously
paid more than three years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so
credited.
   (G)   Penalty. Any taxpayer who fails to make a return, or who makes a
fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
not less than $100 nor more than $200 for each offense, and in addition, shall
be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due.
   (H)   Severability. In the event that the Electricity Excise Tax Law, being
ILCS Ch. 35, Act 640, §§ 15 et seq., is declared unconstitutional, or if
division (A) above is voided by court action, the provisions of Ord. 368
(commonly known as the Ordinance Imposing a Tax on Certain Utilities Doing
Business in the Village of Elwood) shall remain in effect in all respects as if
it had never been amended by this section, and any amounts paid to the village
by any person delivering electricity pursuant to this section shall be deemed
to have been paid pursuant to the Ordinance Imposing a Tax on Certain Utilities
Doing Business in the village as it existed prior to the passage of this
section.

§ 33.10 PERSONAL PROPERTY LEASE TRANSACTION TAX.
   (A)   The tax imposed by this section shall be known as the “personal
property lease transaction tax” or the “lease transaction tax” and is imposed
in addition to all other taxes imposed by the village, or any other municipal
corporation or political subdivision thereof.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      LEASE or RENTAL. Any transfer of the possession or use of personal
property, but not title or ownership, to a user for consideration, whether or
not designated as a lease, rental, license or by some other term, and includes
a NONPOSSESSORY LEASE.
         (a)   NONPOSSESSORY LEASE. A lease or rental wherein use but not
possession of the personal property is transferred and includes, but is not
limited to, leased time on or use of any and all personal property not
otherwise itself rented, such as leased time on or for the use of addressing
machines, billboards, calculators, computers, computer software, copying
equipment or data processing equipment, whether the time is fully or partially
utilized.
         (b)   The words LEASE or RENTAL shall not be construed to include an
agreement which constitutes a bona fide conditional sale of personal property.
The primary consideration in determining whether an agreement is a conditional
sale rather than a LEASE or RENTAL is whether the lessee under the agreement
both is required to make payments the sum of which is at least equal to the
lessor’s cost of the personal property and, under the terms of the agreement,
has the option of taking title to or ownership of the personal property for
nominal or no consideration after all payments required under the agreement
have been made.
      LEASE OR RENTAL PAYMENT PERIOD. The length of time or period of use that
is covered by a single lease or rental payment as agreed to under the terms of
the lease or rental agreement.
      LEASE PRICE or RENTAL PRICE. The consideration for the lease or rental of
personal property, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise,
including cash, credits, property and services, determined without any
deduction for costs or expenses whatsoever, but not including charges that are
added to the price by a lessor on account of the tax imposed by this section or
on account of any other tax imposed on the lessee for the lease or rental of
personal property. LEASE PRICE or RENTAL PRICE shall exclude separately stated
charges not for the use of personal property. If any separately stated charge
is not optional, it shall be presumed unless proved otherwise that it is part
of the charge for the use of the personal property.
      LESSEE. Any person who leases or rents personal property from another,
whether the lease or rental price is paid by the lessee or by another person.
      LESSOR. Any person, including the assignee of any lease or rental
agreement, who leases or rents personal property to users.
      PERSON. Any individual, receiver, administrator, executor, conservator,
trust, estate, partnership, joint venture, club, joint stock company, business
trust, corporation, association, limited liability company, membership
organization, syndicate, society, or any group of individuals acting as a unit,
whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit, or otherwise, or the State
of Illinois or any political subdivision thereof, or the United States or any
instrumentality thereof.
      PERSONAL PROPERTY. Any and all property other than real property.
      RAILROAD ROLLING STOCK. All railroad cars and locomotives (including
switching locomotives) or mobile power units of every nature for moving the
cars, operating on railroad tracks, and includes containers that are used by
interstate carriers for hire, loaded on railroad cars, to transport property.
This definition does not include jacks, flares, or other items that are used by
interstate carriers for hire in servicing the transportation vehicles, but that
do not become a part of the vehicles, and that do not participate directly in
some way in the transportation process.
      USE. The exercise of any right to or power over personal property by a
lessee incident to the lease or rental of that property including, but not
limited to, the permanent or temporary storage, stationing or garaging of
personal property by the lessee. USE by a lessee includes not only the use of
personal property directly by the lessee but also the use of personal property
by the lessee’s agents, representatives or other authorized designees.
      VILLAGE. The Village of Elwood.
   (C)   Tax imposed.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a tax is imposed upon
the lease or rental in the village of personal property, and the privilege of
using in the village personal property that is leased or rented outside the
village. The incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are upon
the lessee of the personal property.
      (2)   The rate of the tax shall be 2% of the lease or rental price. The
tax shall be paid by the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment,
and each tax payment shall be determined by applying the tax rate to the lease
or rental payment.
      (3)   For purposes of this section, the lease or rental of personal
property shall be deemed to take place at the location where the lessee takes
possession or delivery of the personal property.
      (4)   To prevent multiple taxation, any lessee that uses in the village
personal property leased or rented outside the village may claim a credit
against the tax imposed by this section equal to any municipal tax properly due
and actually paid to another municipality with respect to the lease or rental
of such personal property. The credit may not exceed the amount of the tax
imposed by this section that otherwise would be due.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose a tax upon any
transaction or privilege which, under the constitutions of the United States or
the State of Illinois, may not be made the subject of taxation by the village.
   (D)   Exempt lessees. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
the following lessees shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this section:
      (1)   A lessee that is a governmental body;
      (2)   A lessee that is an organization organized and operated exclusively
for charitable, educational or religious purposes.
   (E)   Exempt leases.

stock actually moving in interstate commerce.
         (b)   The use of personal property leased or rented outside the
village if the property is primarily used (more than 50%) outside the village.
      (2)   For purposes of applying any of the exemptions contained in this
section, every lease or rental payment period shall be deemed a separate
transaction or privilege. Any person claiming an exemption shall have the
burden of proving entitlement to the exemption for each lease or rental payment
period for which the exemption is claimed.
   (F)   Collection of tax.
      (1)   It shall be the duty of each lessor to collect the tax imposed by
this section from the lessee at the time of each lease or rental payment, and
to remit the tax to the village. In the event that a lessor fails to collect or
remit the tax required to be collected by this section, the lessor shall be
liable to the village for the amount of such tax.
      (2)   In the case of an assignment of a lease or rental agreement, the
original lessor shall not be required to collect and remit tax which becomes
due after the assignment, provided that the original lessor separately stated
the amount of the tax on the face of the agreement.
      (3)   The tax imposed by this section, when collected or billed, shall be
stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the lease or rental price of
the personal property.
   (G)   Tax remittance and returns. On or before the twentieth day of each
calendar month, every lessor shall remit to the village the tax attributable to
lease or rental payments received during the immediately preceding calendar
month and shall file with the village a remittance return. The remittance
return shall be in a form prescribed by the village, containing such
information as the village may reasonably require. Any person claiming an
exemption shall claim such exemption(s) on the form prescribed by the village,
and shall have the burden of proving entitlement to the exemption for each
lease or rental payment period for which the exemption is claimed.
   (H)   Maintaining books and records. Every taxpayer shall keep accurate
books and records, including original source documents and books of entry,
denoting the activities or transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise
to any tax liability or exemption under this section. All such books and
records shall, at all times during business hours, be subject to and available
for inspection by the village.
   (I)   Failure to pay tax. If for any reason any tax is not paid when due,
the lessor shall pay a penalty at the rate of 20% per month on the amount of
tax which remains due but unpaid. Whenever any lessor fails to pay any tax as
herein provided, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the corporate
authorities of the village, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce
the payment of the tax on behalf of the village in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (J)   Disposition of proceeds of tax. All proceeds resulting from the
imposition of the tax under this section, including penalties, shall be paid
into the treasury of the village and shall be credited to and deposited in the
general corporate fund.
   (K)   Rules and regulations. The corporate authorities of the village may
promulgate rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this
section concerning the enforcement and application of this section. The rules
and regulations which may be promulgated include, but are not limited to, a

§ 36.12 USE OF DEADLY FORCE.
   (A)   Objectives.
      (1)   To construct a framework of legal consideration concerning the use
of deadly force by presenting statutory references to definitions, lawful
requirements and liability both criminal and civil; and
      (2)   To provide the officer an understanding of moral and ethical
obligations complimenting the legal aspects of using deadly force.
   (B)   Introduction.
      (1)   When a peace officer resorts to the use of deadly force, he or she
must be correct both legally and morally. His or her decisions, sometimes made
instantaneously, must be able to withstand the glare of publicity and
dissection in the courts. This requires the officer to have prepared himself or
herself by the knowledge of the law, and the understanding attitude of human
nature, and developed professional skills in the employment of force.
      (2)   His or her actions must be consistent with the rights of all
citizens, accorded them under constitutional laws, in order to reflect credit
upon himself or herself and his or her Department.
      (3)   How well he or she attends to all these considerations in the
classroom may well decide a favorable or unfavorable outcome of a confrontation
in the field. In general, a peace officer may consider this as his or her
motto: Salus Populi Est Suprema Lex (The Safety of the People is the Supreme
Law).
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DEADLY FORCE. The use of means intended or likely to cause death or great
bodily harm.
      DEADLY WEAPON. Any device capable of inflicting death or serious physical
harm and designed or specifically adapted for use as a weapon, or used as a
weapon. Examples: firearm, knife, baseball bat, razor blade.
      FORCIBLE FELONY. A felony which involves the use or threat of physical
force against any individual. It includes:
         (a)   Treason;
         (b)   Murder;
         (c)   Voluntary manslaughter;
         (d)   Aggravated battery;
         (e)   Rape;
         (f)   Robbery;
         (g)   Burglary;
         (h)   Arson;
         (i)   Kidnapping (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-8);
         (j)   Armed violence; and
         (k)   Home invasion.
      REASONABLE BELIEF. The person concerned, acting as a reasonable person,
believes that the described facts exist (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 2-19). This
infers “a reasonable man acting under the same facts and circumstances”.
   (D)   Statutory references from ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 7-1 et seq.
      (1)   Justified use of force (any person including police officer):
         (a)   In defense of person (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 7-1).
            1.   To defend against another’s imminent use of unlawful force;
and
            2.   Deadly force is justified only when necessary to prevent
imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or
commission of a forcible felony.
         (b)   In defense of dwelling (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 7-2).
            1.   To prevent or terminate another’s unlawful entry or attack on
a dwelling; and
            2.   Deadly force is justified only if:
               a.   Entry is attempted in a violent, riotous manner;
               b.   Necessary to prevent assault or personal violence to
himself or herself or another; or
               c.   Necessary to prevent the commission of a felony in the
dwelling.
         (c)   In defense of other property (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 7-3).
            1.   To prevent or terminate another’s trespass or criminal
interference with real or personal property; and
            2.   Deadly force is justified only if necessary to prevent
forcible felony.
         (d)   To summarize the preceding: in general, deadly force is
justified to prevent death or serious injury to a person, another or to prevent
commission of a forcible felony.
      (2)   Peace officers’ use of force in making arrest (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5,
§ 7-5).
         (a)   He or she is justified in the use of any force which he or she
reasonably believes is necessary to affect the arrest or to defend himself or
herself or another while making the arrest.
         (b)   He or she need not retreat or desist because of resistance or
threat of resistance.
         (c)   He or she is justified in use of deadly force when the person in
question:
            1.   Has committed or attempted a forcible entry;
            2.   Is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon;
            3.   Otherwise indicates he or she will endanger human life or
inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay; and
            4.   The officer reasonably believes that deadly force is necessary
to prevent the arrest from being defeated by resistance or escape.
         (d)   Force likely to cause death or great bodily harm (deadly force)
includes (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 7-8):
            1.   Firing in the direction of a person to be arrested even though
no intent exists to kill or inflict bodily harm; or
            2.   Firing at a vehicle in which the person to be arrested is
riding.
      (3)   Use of force to prevent escape (ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, § 7-9).
         (a)   A peace officer is justified in the use of the force, to prevent
escape of an arrested person from custody, as he or she would be if he or she
were arresting the person.
         (b)   He or she is justified in the use of deadly force, to prevent
escape from a penal institution, of a person who he or she reasonably believes
to be lawfully detained under sentence or awaiting trial or commitment for an
offense. There is no distinction as to type offense involved, reason for
confinement, or whether the person is armed.
      (4)   The key to the use of deadly force is not whether the officer
believed the force was necessary, but rather, under all the circumstances,
whether a reasonable person would believe deadly force was necessary.
      (5)   A peace officer making an arrest on an invalid warrant is justified
in using any force he or she would be justified in using if the warrant were
valid; unless he or she knows that the warrant is invalid.
      (6)   There are nine instances under Illinois law in which a peace
officer is justified in using deadly force. The key element, in all
circumstances, is whether or not the use of a deadly force is reasonably
necessary, The nine circumstances include:
         (a)   To protect himself or herself from death or great bodily harm;
         (b)   To protect another from death or great bodily harm;
         (c)   To prevent arrest from being defeated by resistance and person
to be arrested has committed a forcible felony;
         (d)   To prevent arrest from being defeated by resistance and person
to be arrested is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon;
         (e)   To prevent arrest from being defeated by resistance and person
to be arrested indicates that he or she will endanger life or inflict great
bodily harm, unless arrested without delay;
         (f)   The arrestee is escaping and has committed a forcible felony;
         (g)   The arrestee is escaping by means of a deadly weapon;
         (h)   The arrestee is escaping and indicates that he or she will
endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay;
and
         (i)   To prevent the escape from a penal institution (including jail)
when there is a reasonable belief that he or she is lawfully detained, and he
or she is awaiting trial, under sentencing or awaiting commitment.
   (E)   Other considerations.
      (1)   Warning shots.
         (a)   Nothing under Illinois law prohibits the firing of warning shots
directly into the air or into the ground. Their use is highly condemned because
of possibility of:
            1.   Injury to innocent people; and
            2.   Injury to the officer.
         (b)   Warning shots fired in the direction of the person to be
arrested, when deadly force is not justified, are illegal.
      (2)   Moral and ethical aspects.
         (a)   In addition to Illinois and federal law, each officer must make
his or her own moral and ethical judgements concerning the use of deadly force.
         (b)   Before firing his or her weapon, the officer has an instant
decision making process that involves both legal and moral considerations. Even
if the action is justified legally, he or she still has to live in the
community and with himself or herself.
            1.   Communities are slow to forget.
            2.   American tradition values life over property.
            3.   The officer’s family may be affected.
      (3)   Civil law.
         (a)   Even when legally justified in using deadly force, an officer
can be held civilly liable when he or she discharges his or her weapon in a
willful and wanton manner.
         (b)   Before firing his or her weapon, an officer must be aware of:
            1.   His or her location and physical surroundings;
            2.   Innocent people in the vicinity; and
            3.   His or her own accuracy with the weapon under existing
conditions.
         (c)   Section 2-2.02 of the Local Government and Governmental
Employers Tort Immunity Act (ILCS Ch. 745, Act 10), says that a peace officer
is not liable for acts of negligence which are committed while enforcing the
law, but:
            1.   They are liable for acts or omissions, in the execution or
enforcement of the laws, which constitute willful and wanton negligence.
               a.   WILLFUL means self determined, voluntary, deliberate,
intention.
               b.   WANTON means characterized by extreme recklessness,
foolhardiness, heartlessness or maliciousness.
            2.   “Engaged in the execution or enforcement of the law” does not
mean merely “on duty”. It is a factual determination which must be made in
light of the circumstances.
   (F)   Federal Criminal Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242). Federal Civil Rights
Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 through 1985).
      (1)   After the Civil War, some states refused to pass legislation making
it illegal for local government officials to violate the civil rights of
citizens. The federal government then passed legislation designed to preserve
the right to due process of law and equal protection of law under the 14th
Amendment.
      (2)   Section 242 prohibits any person while acting under color of law
from depriving anyone of his or her federal rights. This includes different
punishments or penalties on account of nationality, race, color or creed.
         (a)   The term COLOR OF LAW implies exercise of official authority.
Every on-duty peace officer performing his or her normal functions is acting
under color of law.
         (b)   Specific intent must be proved, but open defiance or reckless
disregard for individual rights will establish specific intent.
      (3)   Section 242 is a misdemeanor punishable by $1,000 fine or one-year
imprisonment unless death results. It then is punishable by life imprisonment.
      (4)   Section 241 is a conspiracy statute and prescribes punishment for
persons conspiring to threaten, oppress or injure another in the exercise of
federal rights.
      (5)   Prosecutions of peace officers have resulted from:
         (a)   Beatings to obtain confessions;
         (b)   Releasing prisoners so they could be intercepted and assaulted;
         (c)   False arrests; and
         (d)   Obtaining false warrants.
   (G)   Conclusion. A peace officer’s use of deadly force is often based on a
split-second judgment in the midst of a complex situation. Many factors are
involved in the decision. They include both criminal and civil legal aspects
plus moral and ethical considerations. The officer can best be prepared to make
the decision by a thorough knowledge and understanding of the factors involved.

      (1)   The Billing Clerk shall mail or cause to be mailed to the address
against which a water and/or sewer bill is due a notice of delinquency.
Provided, however, if the occupant of the property is not the owner and the
Billing Clerk has knowledge of the owner's residential address, the Billing
Clerk shall also mail the notice to the owner of the property. The notice of
delinquency shall set forth the nature and amount of the bill(s) that remain
unpaid. The failure of the Billing Clerk to mail such notice does not
constitute a waiver or effect the consumer's obligation to pay the outstanding
bill.
      (2)   If any such delinquent bill remains unpaid seven days after the
notice of delinquency was mailed, the Public Works Department shall commence
proceedings to shut off the water and/or sewer service, whichever is
applicable. Provided, however, the failure of the Village Public Works
Department to disconnect service does not constitute a waiver of any remedy
available to the village pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   Disconnection.
         (a)   Disconnection of water service for nonpayment of utility related
bills. The water supply may be shut off from any premises for which the water
bill, repair bill or any other utility related bill remains unpaid for 40 days

intent to terminate sewer and/or water service prior to any such termination.
            1.   The notice of intent to terminate service shall contain the
following:
               a.   The ordinance being violated and how such violation can be
corrected, if applicable;
               b.   The number of days the account is in arrears;
               c.   The balance due, including late charges and notice or
termination costs;
               d.   That the utility consumer may contact a representative of
the village and request an informal hearing to resolve disputes as to the
correctness of bills, arrears and/or violations of ordinances prior to
termination of services;
               e.   The name, business address and telephone number of the
village representative to contact to schedule such informal hearing;
               f.   That unless the consumer contacts the appropriate village
representative in writing (by email: utility@villageofelwood.com) within seven
days of the date of the notice to terminate requesting an informal hearing on
the correctness of the utility bill, his/her sewer and/or water service will be
terminated; and
               g.   The date on or after which termination will be affected.
            2.   That an informal hearing shall be held, upon written request
of the consumer, within ten days after written request is made to the Village
Administrator or his/her designee (sometimes herein collectively referred to
for the hearing purpose as "village representative"). The purpose of the
informal hearing is to allow the consumer an opportunity to present information
regarding the correctness of that consumer's utility bill.
            3.   If the village representative finds merit to the consumer's
contentions on the utility bill's correctness or other ordinance matters, no
action shall be taken to terminate service and the user's bill shall be
adjusted accordingly by the village representative with such adjusted bill to
be paid by the utility consumer within seven days of notification of the
village representative's determination.
            4.   In the event a notice of disconnection hearing is requested by
a residential utility consumer wherein the consumer established he/she or a
member of his/her immediate family residing within the premises has a
preexisting life threatening medical condition certified in writing by a
medical doctor licensed by the state and/or the consumer establishes that he/
she is financially unable to pay the utility charge in full or part, the
village representative may allow service continuance so long as the utility
consumer makes satisfactory financial arrangements to pay for past and future
utility charges.
            5.   That if the village representative finds no merit to the
consumer's contentions on the utility bill's or other ordinance issue
correctness, he/she shall communicate this decision to the utility consumer
within seven days after the informal hearing. The utility consumer shall
further be notified that termination of service will be affected if all utility
bills are not paid in full or violations corrected within seven days after
receipt of such decision without further notice.
            6.   That if service is terminated as herein provided, no utility
service shall be reinstated until such time as all violations are corrected
and/or all past due utility bills are paid in full in addition to the payment
of a $75 reinstatement fee during normal business hours. Reconnection hours are
Monday though Friday 7:30 a.m. through 2:30 p.m.
            7.   All utility consumers shall timely pay the undisputed portion
of the utility bill.
            8.   For purposes of this section, any notice regarding
disconnection of service shall be given to the utility consumer in the account
name and address indicated in the village utility consumer records. Any notices
required by this section to the utility consumer may be given by first class
mail, with sufficient postage prepaid or by leaving a copy of the notice
personally with the utility consumer or by leaving a copy of the notice at the
utility consumer's billing address with some person over 13 years of age at
such address and mailing a copy of the notice by U.S. mail addressed to the
utility consumer at the billing address.
         (b)   Disconnection of service for reasons other than nonpayment of
bills.

water service;
               b.   Water is being used for purposes not set forth in the
application;
               c.   Water is being supplied to persons or buildings other than

with;
               g.   The property owner has failed, after notice, to provide
proper access to the water meter or remote reader;
               h.   The owner or occupant of the premises fails to comply to
any proper ban or restriction of outside water usage, as set forth in this
section; or
               i.   When the municipal utilities supervisor is assured that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists.
            2.   Such disconnection shall be followed by written notification
of the cause of disconnection.
            3.   The village may allow reconnection of service when the
violations for shutoff have been corrected and the reconnection charges paid to
the village.
         (c)   Reconnection charge. A service fee as provided in division (D)
(3)(a)6. of this section during normal business hours, or a reinstatement fee
as provided in division (D)(3)(a)6. of this section after normal business

charge has been paid;
            2.   The water service has been scheduled to be shut off due to
nonpayment as above, beginning on the day the service is scheduled for turn
off. The service charge must be paid before the scheduled turn off will be
canceled;

restored the property owner/consumer shall pay to the village a reinstatement
fee as provided in division (D)(3)(a)6. of this section during normal business
hours. The reinstatement fee will be as provided in division (D)(3)(a)6.

Ch. 92
§ 51.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter 51 is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this Chapter 51, the village intends to exercise
its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use
of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards
to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without
limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This
Chapter 51 applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A
facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this
Chapter 51 may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility
as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in
any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this
Chapter 51.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunication provider. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this
Chapter 51 and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement
between the village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such
franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the
term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This
Chapter 51 supercedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto
that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter 51 to
the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or
regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this Chapter 51 and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter 51 when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of

the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
51.21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefore.

§ 51.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this Chapter 51 including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this
Chapter 51 to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as
a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all
other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this
Chapter 51 or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division, at a minimum:
      (l)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this
Chapter 51 that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an
amount in the security fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this

utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently

necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in

right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate

circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of Public Works
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.

51.99
§ 51.19 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.

right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,

authorize an exception only if the utility requesting the exception has
demonstrated that:
      (l)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which an exception is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of an exception. As a condition for
authorizing an exception, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the exception to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may
or may not be expressly contained within this

specifically, in addition to any fines, penalties, or other relief the village
may enforce this chapter at law or in equity by injunction or other relief.
(Ord. 1188, passed 9-4-2024)
§ 51.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this code. There may be times when the village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

necessary to protect against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces or
structures.
   (D)   The permitting authority shall not issue a permit hereunder unless the
applicant shall have furnished a certificate of comprehensive liability
insurance issued by an insurance company licensed to do business in the State
of Illinois and which has a B+ rating or higher, naming Elwood as an additional
insured thereunder in an amount not less than $1,000,000. Permittee and his
insurance carrier shall indemnify and hold the village harmless therewith from
any claim, loss, or damage that may result from the granting of such permit or
that may arise from or on account of any work done thereunder, and further
conditioned that the permittee shall restore at his own cost, to a condition
satisfactory to the permitting authority, any pavement, street structure or
facility, tunnel, sewer, pipe, conduit or other public utility (collectively
referred to as the "roadway improvement"), and any public property appurtenant
thereto that may be damaged by reason of transportation upon, over or through
the roadway improvement(s) under such permit.
   (E)   Every permit shall be in written form and carried in the vehicle or
combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by
any police officer or authorized agent of the permitting authority granting the
permit and no person shall violate any of the terms or conditions of such
special permit. Violation of the terms and conditions of the permit shall not
be deemed a revocation of the permit; however, any vehicle and load found to be
off the route prescribed in the permit shall be held to be operating without a
permit. Any off route vehicle and load shall be required to obtain a new permit
or permits, as necessary, to authorize the movement back onto the original
permit routing. No rule or regulation, nor anything herein shall be construed
to authorize any police officer, court, or authorized agent of the permitting
authority to remove the permit from the possession of the permittee unless the
permittee is charged with a fraudulent permit violation. However, upon arrest
for an offense of violation of permit, operating without a permit when the
vehicle is off route, or any size or weight offense under this chapter when the
permittee plans to raise the issuance of the permit as a defense, the
permittee, or his agent, must produce the permit at any court hearing
concerning the alleged offense.
   (F)   Violation of any rule, limitation, condition or provision of any
permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this section shall not
render the entire permit null and void but the violator shall be deemed guilty
of violation of permit and guilty of exceeding any size, weight or load
limitations in excess of those authorized by the permit. The prescribed route
or routes on the permit are not mere rules, limitations, conditions, or
provisions of the permit, but are also the sole extent of the authorization
granted by the permit. If a vehicle and load are found to be off the route or
routes prescribed by any permit authorizing movement, the vehicle and load are
operating without a permit. Any off route movement shall be subject to the size
and weight maximums as determined by the type or class highway upon which the
vehicle and load are being operated.
   (G)   Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made in violation of a
permit issued in accordance with this section, the person to whom such permit
was granted, or the driver of such vehicle, is guilty of such violation and
either, but not both, persons may be prosecuted for such violation as stated
herein. Any person, firm or corporation convicted of such violation shall be
guilty of a petty offense and shall be fined for the first offense, not more
than $500 and, for the second offense by the same person, firm or corporation
within a period of one year, not less than $500 nor more than $750 and, for the
third offense by the same person, firm or corporation within a period of one
year after the date of the first offense, not less than $750 nor more than
$1,000 and the village shall not issue permits to the person, firm or
corporation convicted of a third offense during a period of one year after the
date of conviction for such third offense.
   (H)   If a vehicle is subject to a permit required by this section, it shall
be unlawful for any person, or any employee or agent of such person, to operate
such vehicle without obtaining such permit. Any person charged with a violation
of this section may be prosecuted for such violation. Any person who pleads not
guilty for said violation shall be present in court for the trial on the
charge. Any person convicted of violating this section shall be fined not less
than $500 and not more than $1,000. In no event shall a person be fined
contemporaneously both under this section and §
70.102 hereunder.
   (I)   An administrative fee of $12 shall be paid by each applicant at the
time of filing a permit application to cover the cost of processing the
application. All filing fees shall be paid to the Village Finance Department or
Village Clerk.
(Ord. 1004, passed 6-20-2012)
§ 70.100 APPEAL FOR HARDSHIP EXEMPTION.
   The owner-operator of any vehicle or fleet owner of multiple vehicles which
are subject to the gross weight limit restrictions contained herein may submit
a written application for appeal ("application") for a hardship exemption to
the Village Administrator.
   (A)   Within seven days of the filing of such an application, the Village
Administrator shall schedule a hearing date thereon. The hearing shall commence
within 30 days of the date of application. The rules of evidence applicable in
a court of law in the State of Illinois shall be relaxed at this hearing. The
permitting authority shall make a ruling and mail to each participant a written
decision within 14 days from the date of the conclusion of the hearing.
   (B)   If the permitting authority determines that a valid hardship does
exist, an exemption may be issued to the applicant. If, however, the vehicle
weight limit restrictions are affirmed upon review, the administrative review
action may be reviewed by a court if the petition for review is filed in the
Twelfth Judicial Circuit or any other court of competent jurisdiction within 35
days of the date the ruling was mailed to any party.
   (C)   It shall be mandatory for every exemption issued under this section to
be carried in the vehicle to which it refers and it shall be produced for
inspection upon request by any police officer or any other municipal officer or
employee having police power.

   (D)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section,
the permitting authority, Village Clerk and Chief of Police, individually or
collectively, or any other person as determined by the corporate authorities,
shall have the authority to enforce all the provisions contained in this
subchapter.

§ 70.102 PENALTY.
   Any person charged with a violation of §
70.097 herein may be prosecuted for such violation. Any person who pleads not

70.097 shall be fined according to the most current overweight bond schedule
issued by the Illinois State Police.

vehicle and load is unlawful shall require the driver to stop and submit to a
weighing process either by means of portable or stationary scales that have
been tested and approved at a frequency prescribed by the Illinois Department
of Agriculture. If such scales are not available at the place where such
vehicle is stopped, the police officer shall require that such vehicle be
driven to the nearest available scale that has been tested and approved by the
Illinois Department of Agriculture. Notwithstanding any provisions of the
Weights and Measures Act or the United States Department of Commerce NIST

suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
may be necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted by
this subchapter. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or
operator of the vehicle at his/her sole risk, and such owner or operator shall
indemnify and hold harmless Elwood, its officers, employees and affiliates from
any claims or damages incurred therewith.
   (C)   Any driver of a vehicle who refuses to stop and submit his vehicle and
load to a weighing process after being directed to do so by an officer or
removes or causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to completion of
the weighing process is guilty of a business offense and shall be fined not
less than $500 nor more than $2,000. The fines in this subsection shall be in
addition to any other fees or fines contained in this subchapter or under
statutory law.
(Ord. 1004, passed 6-20-2012)

§ 71.009 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL LEGEND.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights successively one at a time, or with lighted green
arrows, only the following colors shall be used and such terms and lights and
lighted green arrows shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Circular green (alone).
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, may proceed straight through
or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn.
But vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian
signal as provided under this chapter.
   (B)   Steady yellow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
indication (stop) will be exhibited immediately thereafter or the related green
movement is being terminated, and shall stop before entering the nearest
crosswalk at the intersection. But if such stop cannot be made in safety, a
vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady yellow signal, unless otherwise
directed by a pedestrian control signal, are thereby advised that there is
insufficient the to cross the roadway and no pedestrian shall start to cross.
   (C)   Steady red (alone).
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or such other point as may be indicated by
a clearly visible line or if none, before entering the intersection, end shall
remain standing until the green indication is shown unless otherwise directed
by a sign or lighted green arrow.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely without interfering with any vehicular traffic or unless a
separate “walk” indication is shown.
   (D)   Green straight-through arrow (alone).
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through,
but shall not turn right or left. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right-
of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians legally within the intersection at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk unless directed otherwise by a
pedestrian signal.
   (E)   Green turn arrow (with circular green, with steady yellow, with steady
red, or with green straight-through arrow).
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall comply with the meaning
of the circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or green straight-through
arrow indication as if it were shown alone, except that such vehicular traffic
may cautiously enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the
green turn arrow. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
lawfully within a crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal shall comply with the meaning of the
circular green, steady yellow, steady red, or straight-through arrow indication
as if it were shown alone, unless directed otherwise by a pedestrian signal.
   (F)   In the event an official traffic signal or flashing red signal is
erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of
this division or division (G) shall be applicable except as to provisions which
by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a sign
or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of such sign or marking a stop shall be made at the signal.
   (G)   Flashing signals. Whenever flashing red or yellow signals are used
they shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      (1)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated by rapid

rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked; or, if
none, then before entering the intersection, and pedestrians within or entering
the crosswalk at either edge of the roadway shall hove the right-of-way over
vehicles so stopped. Vehicular traffic having so yielded the right-of-way to
pedestrians entering or within the nearest crosswalk at an intersection may
proceed but shall also yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within any other
crosswalk at the intersection. In the event a school crossing signal is erected
and maintained at a place other than an intersection, provisions of this
section shall be applicable, except as to provisions which by their nature can
have no application.

limit is established pursuant to division (A)(3) is as follows:
         (a)   Outside of an urban district the maximum is 65 miles per hour.
         (b)   In an urban district the maximum is 30 miles per hour, except
that in an alley the maximum is 15 miles per hour.
         (c)   The maximum speed limit for a vehicle of the first division
towing another vehicle is 55 miles per hour outside of an urban district, 30
miles per hour in an urban distract, and 15 miles per hour in an alley.

set other limits as provided by Chapter 95-1/2, U.A.R.T., Section 50.111, Rev.
Stat. 1969, after an engineering or traffic survey, then such limit shall
govern the rate of speed on the streets indicated in such ordinance.
Appropriate signs shall be posted showing such speed limits.
   (B)   Duty to decrease speed. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not
exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the
duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when
approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when
traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazards exist
with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reasons of weather or
highway conditions; and speed shall be decreased as may be necessary, to avoid
colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance
with legal requirements, and the duty of all persons to use due care.

highway of this village at a speed which is greater than is reasonable and
proper with regard to the traffic conditions and the use of the highway, or
endangers the safety of any person or property.
   (E)   Electronic speed detecting devices. Where signs giving notice of a
change in the speed limit have been erected, electronic speed detecting devices
shall not be used within 500 feet beyond any such sign in the direction of
travel. If so used in violation hereof, evidence obtained thereby shall be
inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding.
   (F)   School speed limits. Provided appropriate signs are posted upon
streets and highways within the village giving proper due warning that a school
zone is being approached and indicating the school zone and the maximum speed
limit in effect during school days when school children are present, no person
shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed in excess of 20 miles per hour when
passing a school zone or while traveling upon any public thoroughfare on or
across which children pass going to and from school during school days when
school children are present.

highway within this village at a speed of less than 20 miles per hour, there
shall be displayed at all times during such operation a red flag at least 12
inches square carried on such vehicle at a height not less than ten nor more
than 12 feet above the ground, or at least one flashing amber signal lamp
mounted as high as practicable between sunrise and sunset, such vehicle shall
at all times display at least one flashing amber signal lamp mounted as high as
practicable and of sufficient intensity to be visible to the rear a distance of
at least 500 feet if used in normal sunlight; provided, however, that only the
rear vehicle of a combination of vehicles coupled together need display such a
flag or lamp.
   (H)   Ambulances. The speed limits established by this subchapter do not
apply to ambulances in motion which includes any motor vehicle primarily
designed and used for conveyance of sick or injured persons, provided:
      (1)   The person operating the ambulance reasonably believes that he is

atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of such
vehicle. The aforesaid siren and lamp shall be in full operation at all times
during such journey.
      (3)   The provisions of this section do not relieve the driver of an
ambulance from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons
using the street, nor do those provisions protect the driver of any such
vehicle from the consequences of n reckless disregard of the safety of others.
   (I)   Violations-charges. In every charge of violation of a section of this
subchapter by failure to observe an applicable speed limit, the complaint,
traffic ticket, or notice to appear shall specify the speed at which the

a place of safe storage:
      (1)   Any vehicle known to be stolen; or
      (2)   Any illegally parked, abandoned, inoperable, or otherwise

(Ord. 535, passed 4-7-1997)

vehicle located on public property and not subject to §
75.22 shall affix to such vehicle, in a conspicuous location, in the form of an
adhesive sticker, notice informing the owner that the vehicle must be removed
within 72 hours or else the vehicle will be impounded and towed. The contents
of the notice shall be as set forth herein.
   (C)   A police officer finding an illegally parked, abandoned, or inoperable
vehicle on private property and in view of the general public shall affix to
such vehicle, in a conspicuous location, in the form of an adhesive sticker,
notice informing the owner of the vehicle that the vehicle must be removed
within seven days, or else the vehicle will be impounded and towed. The
contents of such notice shall be as set forth herein. If access to the private
property cannot be gained, then a notice substantially the same as that given
to the vehicle's registered owner shall be sent to the private property owner.
Notice sent to the person last paying property taxes on such property shall be
deemed sufficient as notice upon the property owner.
   (D)   Prior to the impoundment and towing of any vehicle pursuant to
division (A) and after notice of removal has been given pursuant to divisions
(B) or (C), the owner of the vehicle has a right to a pre-tow administrative
hearing before the Village President or the Village President's designee to

§ 75.23 CONTACT OF PRE-TOW AND POST-TOW HEARINGS.
   (A)   A pre-tow hearing or a post-tow hearing required by this section shall
be conducted before a hearing officer designated by the Village President
within 24 hours of receipt of a written demand from the person seeking the
hearing, unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays,
Sundays, and village holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the
24-hour period.
   (B)   The Hearing Officer shall be someone other than the person who
directed the impoundment and towing of the vehicle.
   (C)   The sole issue before the Hearing Officer shall be whether there is or
was probable cause to impound and tow the vehicle in question. “Probably cause
to impound and tow” shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of
ordinary care and prudence to believe that there is or was a sufficient breach
of local, state, or Federal law to grant legal authority for the impoundment
and towing of the vehicle.
   (D)   The Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the
hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right
to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there is or was probable cause to impound and tow the vehicle
in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
prepare a written decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the
person demanding the hearing and to the registered owner of the vehicle (if not
the person requesting the hearing). The Hearing Officer's decision shall in no
way affect any criminal proceeding. The decision of the Hearing Officer is
final. Failure of the registered owner or person who has legal entitlement to
possession of the vehicle to request or attend a scheduled pre-tow or post-tow
administrative hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing.
(Ord. 535, passed 4-7-1997)
§ 75.24 DECISIONS OF THE HEARING OFFICERS AND THEIR EFFECT.
   (A)   In a pre-tow hearing required by this section, the Hearing Officer

      (1)   There is probable cause to impound and tow the vehicle; or
      (2)   There is no such probable cause. In the event that the Hearing
Officer determines that there is probable cause to impound and tow the vehicle,
the Hearing Officer shall prepare and date a certificate of probable cause
which will authorize the Police Department to impound and tow the vehicle. In
the event that the Hearing Officer determines that there is no probable cause
to impound and tow the vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall prepare and date a
certificate of no probable cause which will prohibit the Police Department from
impounding and towing the vehicle. Copies of the certificate of probable cause
or the certificate of no probable cause, whichever is appropriate, shall be
given to the registered owner or person who has legal entitlement to possession
of the vehicle and the Police Department.
   (B)   In a post-tow hearing required by this section the Hearing Officer
shall only determine that as to the vehicle in question either:
      (1)   There was probable cause to impound and tow the vehicle; or
      (2)   There was no such probable cause. In the event that the Hearing
Officer determines that there was probable cause to impound and tow the
vehicle, the Hearing Officer shall prepare and date a certificate of probable
cause, copies of which shall be given to the Police Department, the commercial
towing service having possession of the vehicle, and the owner of the vehicle.
Upon receipt of a certificate of no probable cause, the commercial towing
service having possession of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its
owner. Upon a finding of no probable cause, the village shall pay the towing
and storage fees in accordance with an agreement made between the village and
the commercial towing service. If the owner of the vehicle fails to present the
certificate of no probable cause to the commercial towing service having
possession of the vehicle within 24 hours of its receipt (excluding such days
when the commercial towing service is not open for business), the owner of the
vehicle shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges.

(Ord. 710, passed 2-3-2003)
§ 92.19 EXAMPLES OF STREETS.
   (A)   Crescent street.
      (1)   A crescent is designed so that a street has an entrance and exit at
two points on the same intersecting street. Crescents are numbered
consecutively from their beginning intersection (either the north or east
intersection) if they have one street name.
      (2)   Even though crescent street configurations are north/south and
east/west, the numbers are dependent on the direction of the intersecting
street if one street name has been chosen.
      (3)   In addressing a crescent, addresses shall not be alternated so that
odd and even numbers are located on the same side of the street.
      (4)   Addresses shall be assigned along the crescent continuously in the
same direction as the intersecting street.

name will be required.
      (6)   This will be left up to the discretion of the village.
   (B)   Cul-de-sac street. A cul-de-sac is designed so that the street does
not follow through. There is only one common entrance and exit with a turn
around at the end of the street. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed in the same
manner as north/south and east/west streets with even numbers located on the
north and west side of the street and the odd numbers on the south and east
side of the street. Because of the shape of a cul-de-sac, the center lot at the
end (circular part of the street) of the cul-de-sac shall be the dividing point
for determining whether a lot will receive an even or odd number.
   (C)   North/south east/west street. A north/south or east/west street is
designed to provide vehicular access to abutting property in a grid system.
East/west streets can intersect north/south streets. On the north and west side
of the street shall be even numbers. The south and east side of the street
shall be assigned odd numbers.
   (D)   Trending street. A trending street is designed to bend back and forth

north/south or east/west. Trending streets shall be addressed in the same
manner as the north/south or east/west streets.
   (E)   Diagonal street. A diagonal street is designed to extend as a line on
an angle. The street shall be addressed in the direction in which it covers the
greatest distance being north/south or east/west.
UNIFORM STREET NAME AND ADDRESS NUMBERING SYSTEM
§ 92.30 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADDRESS NUMBER ASSIGNMENTS AND REASSIGNMENT.
   (A)   Whenever a building has been numbered or renumbered in accordance with
this subchapter, that number shall not be changed or altered unless upon the
direction of the village or those authorized by the same to assign addresses.
   (B)   In all cases where numbers have been assigned on any street, it shall
be the duty of the village to adjust and reassign such numbers as the same may
be required from time to time. In all cases where there is a mistake or
conflict in numbers, the village shall direct and make proper adjustment of the
same. The village shall not be held liable for any expenses incurred as a
result of the address assignment or adjustment.
   (C)   At all times, the village shall keep an up to date list of the current
address for each parcel and property assigned an address pursuant to this
subchapter located in the village.
   (D)   It will be the responsibility of the individual property owner,
renter, lessee or other person(s) having possession or control of the property
to notify all appropriate agencies (post office, fire protection district,
telephone company, electric company and the like) of the most current assigned
address issued by the village.
(Ord. 694, passed 7-1-2002)
§ 92.31 GENERAL INFORMATION; NAME AND NUMBERING.
   (A)   The numbering for the Village Uniform Street Name and Address
Numbering System shall begin at State Street and Madison Street in the City of
Chicago and extend outwardly. The number system shall increase southerly, and
westerly beginning with the corporate limits of the village, as it may change
from time to time with annexations.
   (B)   In cases where an address shall be changed, property owners shall
receive official notification of the new address assignment in advance of the
changes. These notices shall state the old and new address, effective date of
the change, and penalty for not displaying the new address number.
Notifications of number change are usually sent 30 days before the effective
date of the change.
   (C)   North and west sides of the street shall have even numbers. South and
east sides of the street shall have odd numbers.
   (D)   The system defines eight blocks equal to one mile. Each block is
approximately 660 feet long In addressing there are 66 possible numbers per
block. They consist of 33 odd numbers and 33 even numbers, being evenly spaced
out every 20 feet. This is the method to be used to assign addresses for the
Village Uniform Street Name and Address Numbering System.
   (E)   Every section in each township has a north/south and east/west
corresponding boundary. In each section, there are eight blocks. The numbers
shall increase from north to south and east to west. (See § 92.39(A) below).
   (F)   Street directions are designated as either S. for north/south streets,
W. for east/west streets.
   (G)   Developers shall choose street layouts from the following designs.
      (1)   Crescent (loop) streets. A crescent is designed so that a street
has an entrance and exit at two points on the same intersecting street.
Crescents are numbered consecutively from their beginning intersection (either
the north or east intersection) if they have one street name. Even though
crescent street configurations are north/south and east/west, the numbers are
dependent on the direction of the intersecting street if one street name has
been chosen. In addressing a crescent, addresses shall not be alternated so
that odd and even numbers are located on the same side of the street. Addresses
shall be assigned along the crescent continuously in the same direction as the
intersecting street. It shall depend on the length of the street if more than
one street name will be required. This will be left up to the discretion of the
village. Refer to the illustration attached as §
92.19(A) above.
      (2)   Cul-de-sac streets. A cul-de-sac is designed so that the street
does not follow through. There is only one common entrance and exit with a turn
around at the end of the street. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed in the same
manner as north/south and east/west streets with even numbers located on the
north and west side of the street and the odd numbers on the south and east
side of the street. Because of the shape of a cul-de-sac, the center lot at the
end (circular part of the street) of the cul-de-sac shall be the dividing point
for determining whether a lot will receive an even or odd number. Refer to the
illustration attached as §
92.19(B).
      (3)   North/south - east/west streets. A north/south or east/west street
is designed to provide vehicular access to abutting property in a grid system.
East/west streets can intersect north/south streets. On the north and west side
of the street shall be even numbers. The south and east side of the street
shall be assigned odd numbers. Refer to the illustration attached as §
92.19(C).
      (4)   Trending street. A trending street is designed to bend back and
forth with few straight areas. The street will be considered as trending in the
direction in which it covers the greatest distance being north/south or east/
west. Trending streets shall be addressed in the same manner as the north/south
or east/west streets. Refer to the illustration attached as §
92.19(D).
      (5)   Diagonal street. A diagonal street is designed to extend as a line
on an angle. The street shall be addressed in the direction in which it covers
the greatest distance being north/south or east/west. Refer to the illustration
attached as §
92.19(E).
   (H)   If one structure has several units designed for individual occupancy
and each unit is accessed from outside of the structure, then each unit shall
have its own address. If individual units are accessed solely from within the
structure, then the structure shall have an address and each unit within shall
use the same address and have an individual sequential unit letter or number.
For structures having several main entrances, each leading to separate groups
of units, each main entrance shall have its own address and units accessed from
within that entrance shall use that address and have an individual sequential
unit letter or number. An exception to this section is a motel/hotel where one
address shall be assigned to each building and each room for rent shall use the
same address and have an individual sequential unit letter or number.
   (I)   For private drives and interior parking bays and group housing/
commercial developments, generally numbers shall be assigned to all dwelling
units or structures facing a parking bay, private drive, or interior courts, as
if they were facing upon the main street to which the driveway connects. The
numbers shall remain in numerical sequence.
   (J)   On a corner lot, the address assigned shall be assigned according to
the direction that the principal building faces. The address should correspond
with the location of the primary entrance door. In some cases, the address
shall be assigned by the location of the driveway due to site design
circumstances.
   (K)   When practicable, the continuation of an existing street shall have
the same name as the existing street.
   (L)   When a street makes a 90-degree turn at any point and it is determined
by the village that is necessary to avoid confusion in the delivery of
emergency services, a change in street name shall occur to eliminate confusion.
   (M)   The name of the new street shall not duplicate or mimic the name of
existing streets within the area served by the same post office, Fire
Department or other emergency service organizations.

obligation hereunder. In no event shall the village be responsible for any
additional cost, lost value or aesthetics.
   (B)   Damage to improperly installed or non-compliant mailboxes or other
structures. Damage to any unlawfully installed mailbox or other structure,

informal hearing before the Village Clerk or the Village President or his or
her designee, and at that time, may present evidence showing that the license
should not be revoked. The Village Clerk, Village President or his or her

construed to permit the operation of a licensed business in more than one
location in the village; a separate license shall be required for each location

the principal or accessory uses shall be connected or shall be located on the
same lot or parcel, shall be operated and managed by the same person or owner,
and shall be an establishment with the same classification.
   (C)   Unless otherwise provided, the location of any licensed business or

shall be denied. The Village Clerk shall promptly notify the applicant of the
denial, indicating the reason(s) therefor.

of expiration of the license held by the licensee three weeks prior to the date
of the expiration. However, a failure to send out the notice, or the failure of
the licensee to receive the notice shall not excuse the licensee from a failure
to obtain a new license, or a renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in an
action based on operation without a license.
   (B)   Except as otherwise provided, each license may be renewed upon proper

§ 150.05 SURPLUS PROPERTY.
   (A)   Incorporation. The preambles in the ordinance codified herein hereby
are incorporated by this reference as if set out in full at this place.
   (B)   Responsible bidder.
      (1)   Criterion for responsible bidder. Bids shall be evaluated based on
the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include the
following criteria:
         (a)   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the service required;
         (b)   Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the
service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference;
         (c)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder;
         (d)   The quality of the performance of previous contracts or
services;
         (e)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and
ordinances relating to the contract or service;
         (f)   The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the
bidder to perform the contract or provide the service;
         (g)   The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required;
         (h)   The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service for the use of the subject of the contract; and
         (i)   The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid.
      (2)   Obligations of responsible bidder.
         (a)   Compliance with municipal ordinances. All responsible bidders
shall comply with the ordinances adopted by the village, including but not
limited to the Prevailing Wage Ordinance and any ordinance governing the
operation of businesses within the village. Similarly, all responsible bidders
must show that they are in “good standing” with governing and/or taxing bodies
within the county and the state.
         (b)   Bid and performance bonds. Bid and performance bonds or other
security, including cash may be required for supply or service contracts as the
Village Administrator, in consultation with the head of a using department,
deems advisable to protect the village’s interest. Any such bonding
requirements shall be set forth in the solicitation. Bid or performance bonds
shall not be used as a substitute for a determination of a bidder or offeror’s
responsibility.
         (c)   Collusion among bidders and disclosures. Any agreement or
collusion among bidders or prospective bidders to bid a fixed price or to
otherwise restrain freedom of competition by agreement shall render the bids of
such bidders void and a finding of “non-responsible”. Each bidder shall
accompany his or her bid with a written sworn statement that no such agreement
or collusion took place.
   (C)   Methods of source selection. Unless otherwise authorized through the
Governmental Joint Purchasing Act (ILCS Ch. 30, Act 525, §§ 2 et seq.) or other
lawful provision, all village contracts shall be awarded by one of the
following methods.
      (1)   Competitive sealed bidding. Contracts shall be awarded by
competitive sealed bidding, except as otherwise provided in this section.
         (a)   Invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall be issued for
contracts and shall include specifications and all contractual terms and
conditions applicable to the procurement.
         (b)   Public notice. Adequate public notice of an invitation for bids
shall be given at a reasonable time, not less than 15 calendar days prior to
the date set forth therein for the opening of bids. The Village Administrator
shall designate a means of distribution of information to interested parties
using methods that are reasonably available. These methods may include
publication in newspapers of general circulation, electronic or paper mailing
lists, and web sites designated and maintained for the notification. The notice
shall state the place, date and time of the bid opening.
         (c)   Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of
one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for
bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as the
Village Administrator deems appropriate, together with the name of each bidder
shall be recorded; the record created herein and each bid submitted shall be
open to public inspection in accordance with lawful requirements.
         (d)   Correction or withdrawal of bids. Correction or withdrawal of
inadvertently erroneous bids before or after bid opening or cancellation of
awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted where
appropriate. All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids or to
cancel awards or contracts based on bid mistakes, shall be supported by a
written determination made by the Village Administrator. Mistakes discovered
before bid opening may be withdrawn by written, electronic or telegraphic
notice received in the office designated in the invitation for bids prior to
the time set for bid opening. Any modification prior to the bid opening must be
submitted in a sealed envelope prior to the scheduled opening of the bid. After
bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial
to the interest of the village or fair competition shall be permitted. In lieu
of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake may be permitted to
withdraw its bid if:
            1.   The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid
document, but the intended corrected bid is not similarly evident; or
            2.   The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly
demonstrates that a mistake was made.
         (e)   Award. The contract shall be awarded by the corporate
authorities with reasonable promptness by appropriate written notice to the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements and
criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.
         (f)   Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to
prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an
invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers
to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers
have been determined to be technically acceptable under the criteria set forth
in the first solicitation.
      (2)   Competitive sealed proposals. When the Village Administrator
determines that the use of competitive bidding is either not practical or not
advantageous to the village, a contract may be awarded by the use of the
competitive sealed proposals method.
         (a)   Request for proposals. Proposals shall be solicited through a
request for proposals.
         (b)   Public notice. Adequate public notice of the request for
proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided in division (C)(1)(b)
above, provided the notice shall not be less than 20 calendar days prior to the
date set forth therein for the opening of proposals.
         (c)   Management of proposals. Proposals shall be opened so as to
avoid disclosure of the identity of any offeror or the contents of any proposal
to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of
proposals shall be prepared containing the name of each offeror, the number of
modifications received, if any, and a description sufficient to identify the
item offered. The register of proposals shall be open for public inspection
only after contract award.
         (d)   Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the
relative importance of price and other evaluation factors.
         (e)   Processing responses to request for proposals. As provided in
the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible
offerors who submit proposals determined to be potentially acceptable for award
for the purpose of clarification and to assure full understanding of and
conformance to the solicitation requirements. Offerors determined to be
substantially equivalent shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with
respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and the
revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose
of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be
no disclosure of the identity of competing offerors or of any information
derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors.
         (f)   Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose
proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the village, taking into
consideration, price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for
proposals. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The
contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made.
         (g)   Reverse auctions. The Village Administrator may award contracts
for supplies and nonprofessional services by reverse auction, a procurement
method where bidders, anonymous to each other, electronically submit real time
bids. During the bidding process, bidders’ prices are revealed and bidders
shall have the opportunity to modify their bid prices for the duration of the
time period established through the solicitation. Award shall be made to the
lowest responsive, responsible bidder.
      (3)   Small purchases. Any purchase estimated not to exceed $20,000 may
be made in accordance with the small purchase procedures authorized in this
section; provided, however, that procurement requirements shall not be
artificially divided so as to constitute a small purchase under this section.
         (a)   Small purchases in excess of $10,000 but less than $20,000.
Insofar as it is practical for small purchases in excess of $10,000, but less
than $20,000, no less than three persons shall be solicited to submit written
quotations. Award shall be made to the responsive, responsible person offering
the lowest acceptable quotation. The names of the persons submitting
quotations, and the date and amount of each quotation shall be recorded and
maintained as a public record.
         (b)   Small purchases in excess of $1,000 but less than $10,000.
Insofar as is practical for small purchases in excess of $1,000, but less than
$10,000) no less than three persons shall be solicited to submit oral
quotations. Award shall be made to the responsive, responsible person offering
the lowest acceptable quotation. The names of the persons submitting
quotations, and the date and amount of each quotation shall be recorded and
maintained as a public record.
         (c)   Small purchases not to exceed $1,000. The Village Administrator
shall adopt operational procedures for making small purchases of $1,000 or
less. The operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and
reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased.
         (d)   Delegation to village departments.
            1.   The Village Administrator may adopt operational procedures
allowing village departments to obtain written or oral quotations and submit
them with the purchase request.
            2.   In accordance with divisions (C)(3)(b) and (c) above, the
Village Administrator may adopt operational procedures allowing village
departments to make small purchases up to $10,000 per transaction, provided
said delegated authority is exercised in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
      (4)   Sole source procurement. A contract may be awarded without
competition when the Village Administrator determines in writing, after
conducting a good faith review of available sources, that there is only one
source for the required supply, service or construction item. The Village
Administrator, or their designee, shall conduct negotiations, as appropriate,
as to price, delivery and terms. A record of sole source procurements shall be
maintained as a public record and shall list each contractor’s name, the amount
and type of each contract, a listing of the item(s) procured under each
contract and the identification number of each contract file.
      (5)   Emergency procurements. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this section, the Village Administrator may make, or authorize others to make
emergency procurements of supplies, services or construction items when there
exists an immediate threat to public health, welfare or safety or to prevent or
minimize serious disruption of government services; provided that the emergency
procurements shall be made with the competition as is practical under the
circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for
the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract
file. As soon as feasible, a record of each emergency procurement shall be made
and shall set forth the contractor’s name, the amount and type of the contract,
a listing of the item(s) procured under the contract, and the identification
number of the contract file. The record of any emergency procurement in excess
of $20,000 shall be submitted to the Village Board of Trustees at its next
regularly scheduled meeting.
      (6)   Revenue generating and concession contracts. Revenue generating and
concession contracts shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions
contained in this section, except that price shall be evaluated on the basis of
the highest bid or offer.
      (7)   Responsibility of bidders and offerors. Notwithstanding the source
selection process utilized, a written determination on nonresponsibility
setting forth the basis of the finding, shall be prepared by the Village
Administrator in the event that the lowest responsive bidder is found
nonresponsible. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to promptly
supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility
may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility with respect to the
bidder or offeror.
      (8)   Pre-qualification of suppliers. Prospective suppliers may be pre-
qualified for particular types of supplies, services and construction. The
Village Administrator shall determine the method of submitting pre-
qualification information and the information required in order to be pre-
qualified.
      (9)   Cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals.
         (a)   An invitation for bids, a request for proposals or other
solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected
in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation by the Village
Administrator when in the best interest of the village. Notice of cancellation
shall be sent to all persons solicited. The reasons therefore shall be made
part of the contract file.
         (b)   Each solicitation issued by the village shall state that the
solicitation may be canceled and that any bid or proposal may be rejected in
whole or in part when in the best interest of the village. The reason(s) for
rejection shall be provided upon request by unsuccessful bidders or offerors.
   (D)   Procurement of construction.
      (1)   Responsibility for selection of project delivery method. The
Village Administrator, in consultation with the appropriate village department
or agency, shall have discretion to select the appropriate project delivery
method. In determining which method to use, the Village Administrator shall
consider the village’s requirements, its resources and the capabilities of
potential contractors.

(Ord. 576, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 151.02 INDUSTRIAL IMPACT.
   (A)   Impact donations required.
      (1)   The subdivider, builder or developer shall be required to designate
10% of the gross area of the platted subdivision or development as “reserved
for public use” or “open space”, or at the sole option of the Village Board,

(Ord. 577, passed 4-12-1999)
§ 151.03 RESIDENTIAL IMPACT FEE.
   (A)   Incorporation. The preambles to the ordinance codified herein are
incorporated by this reference as if set out in full at this place.
   (B)   Requirement for cash contribution. The village shall require the
developer or subdivider of each residential development to pay a cash
contribution or impact fee in lieu of land dedications otherwise required for
the benefit of the Elwood Fire Protection District (“EFPD”). The cash
contributions shall be held in trust by the EFPD solely for the use and
acquisition of land for a Fire Protection District site to serve the immediate
or future needs of residents from that subdivision or for the improvement to
any EFPD site facilities or equipment which already serve the needs of that
development. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
is not expended for the purpose set forth herein within 20 years from the date
of receipt, it shall be refunded to the developer or subdivider who made the
contribution. The cash contribution shall be deposited with EFPD and
appropriate proof of payment shall be delivered to the Village Clerk before the
issuance to the developer or subdivider of its first building permit for the
subdivision or development.
   (C)   Calculation of cash contribution.
      (1)   Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land that
otherwise would have been dedicated as a Fire Protection District site, shall
be based on the “fair market value” of the acres of land in the area improved
as specified herein. It has been determined that the “fair market value” of the
improved land in and surrounding the village is $83,000 per acre and that
figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the developer or
subdivider files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such
objection, the developer or subdivider shall submit an appraisal showing the “
      (2)   NFPA Standard 1710 (Standard for the Organization and Deployment of
Fire Suppression Operation, Emergency Medical and Special Operations to the
Public by Career Fire Departments”, 2001 edition). The National Fire Protection
Association (“NFPA”) has adopted its Standard 1710 which has established
response time standards for Fire Protection and other emergency
servicepersonnel which shall serve as a factor in determining EFPD site
location and/or cash contributions in accordance with the Contribution Table
attached hereto and incorporated herewith as Exhibit “A”.
   (D)   Dedication of land in lieu of cash contribution. There may be
circumstances in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination
of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
      (1)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for an EFPD site. The portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the EFPD location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land
that would have been required to be dedicated; and
      (2)   A major part of the EFPD site has already been acquired and only a
small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The
remaining dedicated portions shall be used to complete the site, while a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be made to satisfy the requirements of this
section.
   (E)   Location of land dedications. Location of land dedications. The
applicable provisions and standards adopted by the EFPD, along with the
Comprehensive Plan adopted by the village shall be used as a guideline in
locating sites. An EFPD site of not less than one and one-half acres shall be
considered a requirement based on existing EFPD facilities. Site classification
and size of fire protection district sites within the village shall be
determined in accordance with existing EFPD criteria and shall take into
account the study completed on behalf of the EFPD.
   (F)   Intents and purposes.
      (1)   This chapter is intended to supplement and be consistent with the
Village of Elwood Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the use and development
of land so as to ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the
cost of capital expenditures necessary to provide school facilities, parks,
fire protection, village and library facilities, in the Village of Elwood as
contemplated by the Village of Elwood Comprehensive Plan and objectives of the
Board of Trustees.
   (G)   Criteria for requiring park and recreational land dedication.
      (1)   Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate density of a
proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement for dedication shall be seven acres of land
per 1,000 of ultimate population or fraction thereof in accordance with the
Park Land Standards and Guidelines attached hereto as Appendix B and made part
hereof.
      (2)   Location. The Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the Village of
Elwood shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central location which
will serve equally the entire development is most desirable. In large
developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to
established standards for park area distances.
      (3)   Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas.
         (a)   When developers or subdividers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreation services.
         (b)   Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park
and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the
option of the Village Board be provided in the form of a "private" open space
in lieu of a dedicated "public" open space. The extent of private or public
open space shall be determined by the Village Board, based upon the needs of
the projected residents and in conformance with the total park and recreation
land for the general area.
         (c)   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated
parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the
installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer
or subdivider as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas,
including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the
Village Board, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the
developer or subdivider must guarantee that these private recreation areas will
be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate
legal documents. Private "swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When
an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary
to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from
the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be
given.
   (H)   Criteria for requiring school site dedication.
      (1)   Requirements and population ratio. The ultimate number of students
to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear
directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The
land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of:
estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the
maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the minimum
recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land
deemed necessary to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the
estimated increase in children in each such school classification.
      (2)   School classification and size of school site. School
classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined
in accordance with the following criteria:
 
School Classification by Maximum Number of Students Minimum Number of Acres of
Grades                   for Each Such School       Land for Each School Site
                         Classification             of Such Classification
Elementary Schools,
grades Kindergarten      600 students               11 acres
through 5th (and/or K-6)
Junior High Schools,
grades 6th through 8th   900 students               34 acres
(and/or 7th and 8th)
High Schools, grades 9th 1,500 students             55 acres
through 12th (9-12)
 
      (3)   Location. The standards adopted by the affected school districts,
along with the Comprehensive Plan adopted by the village shall be used as a
guideline in locating sites.
   (I)   Criteria for requiring fire protection district site dedication.
      (1)   Requirement and population ratio. The use and density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirements for dedication shall be in accordance with
the following: Fire protection uses 0.03 acres per 1,000 population.
      (2)   Location. The applicable provisions and standards adopted by the
Elwood Fire Protection District, along with the Comprehensive Plan adopted by
the village shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A Fire Protection
District site of not less than 0.63 acres shall be considered a requirement
based on existing fire protection facilities. Site classification and size of
fire protection district sites within the village shall be determined in
accordance with existing Fire Protection District criteria.
   (J)   Criteria for requiring village use site dedication.
      (1)   Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate density of a
proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement for dedication shall be 4.09 acres of land
per 1,000 of ultimate population or a fraction thereof in accordance with the
following classifications:
         (a)   Village uses: 4.09 acres per 1,000 population; and
         (b)   Total for dedication
      (2)   Location. The Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the Village of
Elwood shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central location which
will serve equally the entire development is most desirable. In large
developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according
to established standards for village use distances.
   (K)   Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of village, park,
school, and fire protection sites.
Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreation
purposes or a school site or for village or fire protection purposes, the
village shall require the developer or subdivider to pay a cash contribution in
lieu of the land dedicated required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and
recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the village, solely for
the acquisition of land, as hereinbefore classified which will be available to
serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the improvement of other existing park and recreation land
which already serves the needs of the entire community. The cash contribution
in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the school district, solely
for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or
future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the
improvement to any existing school site or facilities which already serves the
needs of that development or the entire school district. The cash contribution
in lieu of village sites shall be held in trust by the village, solely for the
use and acquisition of land for village sites to serve the immediate and future
needs of residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of
any existing village site or facilities which already serves the need of that
development. The cash contribution in lieu of Fire Protection District sites
shall be held in trust by the Fire Protection District solely for the use and
acquisition of land for a Fire Protection District site to serve the immediate
or future needs of residents from that subdivision or for the improvement to
any Fire Protection District site facilities or equipment which already serves
the needs of that development. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of
land dedication is not expended for the purpose set forth herein within ten
years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the developer or
subdivider who made such contribution. Said cash contribution in lieu of
village, park, school, and Fire Protection District land shall be deposited
with the Village Treasurer before the issuance to the developer or subdivider
of its first building permit for such subdivision or development.
      (1)   Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park, village,
school and Fire Protection District sites. It has been determined that the
"fair market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the village is
$83,000 per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein
unless the developer or subdivider files a written objection thereto. In the
event of any such objection, the developer or subdivider shall submit an
appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the area of
his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair
market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the Village Board
based upon such information submitted by the developer or subdivider and from
other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board by the School
Districts, Fire Protection District or others.
      (2)   Criteria for requiring dedication and fee. There will be situations
in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
         (a)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a Village, Fire Protection District, park or school site. That
portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the village, Fire
Protection District, park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as
aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any
additional land that would have been required to be dedicated;
         (b)   A major part of the village, Fire Protection District, park or
school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is
needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining dedicated
portions shall be required to complete the site. The remaining portions shall
be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be
required.
   (L)   Density formula. The table of population density attached hereto as
Appendix C and made a part hereof is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash
contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by
the developer or subdivider. In the event a developer or subdivider files a
written objection to Appendix C attached hereto it shall submit its own
demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated
from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be
made by the Village Board based upon such demographic information submitted by
the developer or subdivider and from other sources which may be submitted to
school districts, Fire Protection Districts or others. It is recognized that
population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the
years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of
fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and
amendment if necessary.
   (M)   Reservation of additional land. Where the Comprehensive Plan or the
standards of the village require a larger amount of village, Fire Protection
District, park/recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or
planned unit development than the developer or subdivider is required to
dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer or subdivider's contribution
shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body
designated by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one
year from the date of approval of the final plat.
   (N)   Combining with adjoining developments. Where the subdivision or
planned unit development is less than five acres, an EFPD site which is to be
dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining
developments in order to produce a usable EFPD site(s) without hardship on a
particular developer or subdivider.
   (O)   Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not
differ materially from surrounding land.
   (P)   Improved sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed
drainage, curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or
acceptable provision made therefor in accordance with applicable village
ordinances. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition of
“improved” sites may be deleted due to the delay of time between the dedication
of any such site and construction of the facilities thereon.
   (Q)   Security. The total cash contribution to be required shall be
determined at the time the final plat is approved. Prior to execution of the
final plat by the appropriate village officials, the developer or subdivider
shall as security for the payment as determined, provide the village with a
letter of credit in the amount as determined from an acceptable banking
institution or shall make a cash deposit in an acceptable institution of the
total amount required in an interest bearing account, which account shall be
drawn from only by the consent of the village in the event that the payments
are not paid when due. All interest accrued in the savings account shall accrue
to the benefit of the developer or subdivider. The letter of credit as
hereinabove provided shall expressly provide that the village may draw against
it at any time where the developer or subdivider fails to make the payments due
hereunder. Prior to the issuance of any building permit, the developer or
subdivider, or the assignees or successors in interest, shall prove payment of
the amount of cash required, attributable to the land relating to the building
permit, by producing the appropriate receipt(s) at the designated office of the
village. The developer or subdivider may apply to the Village Board and
President for a reduction of the letter of credit upon payment of the total
fees due in quarterly installments.
   (R)   Exceptions. Dedication of land or payment of cash contributions in
lieu thereof as required by this section shall be applicable unless the
corporate authorities of the village, in consultation with EFPD officials,
determine either that:
      (1)   The new subdivision or development will not in itself have an
impact upon or create a need for fire and/or emergency medical service
facilities;
      (2)   The subdivision or development will have a lesser or differing
impact than is provided for herein; or
      (3)   Any such need is not uniquely attributable to such new subdivision
or development. In any such instances, the corporate authorities, in
consultation with EFPD officials, may determine that any required dedication of
land or payment of cash in lieu thereof may be reduced to reflect the specific
impact of any such subdivision or development. The determination in this regard
by the corporate authorities of the village shall be binding upon all the
parties involved.
   (S)   Intergovernmental agreement for indemnification. Upon the request of
the village and within 30 days thereof, and prior to receiving a dedication of
land or a cash contribution in lieu of land, the EFPD shall execute an
intergovernmental agreement with the village in which the EFPD agrees to
indemnify and hold the village harmless, including all associated costs and
reasonable attorney fees incident to any suits filed or claims made in which
the validity or application of any section of this chapter is challenged. The
selection of counsel to defend any such action shall be by the mutual agreement
and consent of the village and the EFPD.
   (T)   Intergovernmental agreement to establish location. The location of the
site shall be subject to an intergovernmental agreement between the village and
the EFPD in which the development is located, or, in the absence of an
agreement, the village’s Comprehensive Plan. The village recognizes that the
ultimate responsibility for development and maintenance of land and facilities
lies with the EFPD and shall therefore consult with the EFPD in pursuit of a
mutually acceptable location. The ultimate decision as to acceptance of land
for an EFPD site or a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be reserved to
the EFPD.
   (U)   Conveyance of land donation or payment of cash contributions. The land
to be dedicated pursuant to this section shall be clearly depicted on the
preliminary plat. The EFPD shall inspect the land to be dedicated and shall
receive title to the land upon written acceptance of all improvements.
      (1)   The developer or subdivider shall convey all required land to the
EFPD designated by the President and Village Board within one year after the
recording of the final plat or final planned unit development plat for the unit
in which the site is located or as may be otherwise agreed by the developer or
subdivider and the EFPD. When a cash contribution is required, the developer or
subdivider shall make the cash contribution for each lot directly to the EFPD
prior to the issuance of a building permit for the subject lot. Each EFPD shall
thereafter be responsible to account for the sum so deposited, including its
use and refund, if appropriate, as set forth herein. Evidence of the conveyance
of land or a receipt for the payment of a cash contribution issued by the EFPD
shall be submitted to the village when an application for a building permit is
filed. The failure to provide sufficient evidence of the required conveyance or
cash contribution shall constitute sufficient grounds for the denial of the
application for a building permit or, when a building permit has already been
issued, revocation of the building permit.
      (2)   The conveyance of land shall be by warranty deed naming the EFPD as
the sole grantee. The deed shall be accompanied by a commitment for a policy of
owner’s title insurance naming the EFPD as a proposed insured. All title
encumbrances unacceptable to the EFPD shall be removed by the developer or
subdivider prior to submitting the deed and commitment for title insurance
policy. Both the deed and the commitment for title insurance policy shall be
delivered directly to the EFPD. The developer or subdivider shall not record
any deed or conveyance. After review of the status of title, the EFPD shall
record the deed or, if title is unacceptable, return the deed to the developer
or subdivider with an explanation of the title defects. The developer or
subdivider shall correct the noted defects and deliver a deed and revised
commitment to the EFPD within a reasonable time.
      (3)   The developer or subdivider shall ascertain the pro rata real
estate taxes through the date of acceptance of the deed and commitment for
policy of title insurance by the EFPD. The developer or subdivider shall make
payment in the amount to the EFPD immediately upon acceptance of the deed and
commitment for title insurance policy by the EFPD. The village acknowledges
that the EFPD can not be compelled to accept any land dedication that it does
not want to accept.
   (V)   Penalty and enforcement provision.
      (1)   A violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor punishable
according to law. However, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal
prosecution, the village or any fee payor shall have the power to sue for
relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Anyone knowingly furnishing false information to any official or
the Village President on any matter related to the administration of this
section shall constitute a violation thereof.
   (W)   Appeal. Any decision made by the Village President or Treasurer, his
or her designee or the Building Official in the course of administering this
section may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
village municipal code.
   (X)   Arbitration. In the event any dispute arises concerning the
application of this section, at its sole option, the Village Board may seek
resolution of the dispute through arbitration, mediation or any other
acceptable form of alternative dispute resolution.
   (Y)   Authority to establish guidelines.
      (1)   The corporate authorities of the village shall have at all times
the power and authority to establish or amend the criteria for land dedications
or contributions in lieu thereof as contemplated in this section.
      (2)   The schedule in division (Z) below may be amended and replaced by
official corporate action pursuant to the authority granted in this section.
   (Z)   Exhibit A; contribution table. The following formula will be utilized
to calculate fire protection district impact fees for all residential
development within the village: density (homes/acre) x 640 (acres/square mile)
x $83,000.00 (FMV/acre) x 8 = Total needs of EFPD (2 stations + training
facility) Total needs x contribution value (as identified in the Time Response
Study/Exhibit 4) = cash contribution.

planned unit developments (“PUD”) in which similarity or architectural form and
style of the dwellings is integral to the success of a unified plan, and in
which the high quality of building materials, building plans and site plan
details overcome the presumed deficiencies of similarity. In such cases, the
developer shall request an exception from the ordinance and the Plan Commission

purposes:
   (A)   To meet the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, § 18g “Rivers, Lakes
and Streams Act”;
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to soil erosion;
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (D)   To protect human life and health from flooding hazards;
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayers for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program, codified as 44 C.F.R. § 59-79, as amended;
   (H)   To protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and storm water impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.
(Ord. 765, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 154.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACT. An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams
of the state, ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §§ 5 et seq.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are
specified in §
154.08(B) below.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% probability of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FREQUENCY FLOOD
EVENT. Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in
§
154.06.
   BUILDING. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. This term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers to be installed on a site
for more than 180 days, unless fully licensed and ready for highway use.
   CHANNEL. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash or natural or human-made drainage way, which has a definite bed
and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris or trash from the channel. CHANNELIZATION is a severe form
of CHANNEL MODIFICATION involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood
storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the
floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
offsite flood water elevations and flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE. Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map.
Preconstruction approval gives assurance to the property owner that once an
appropriate use is constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map
can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as-built
plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or
flood insurance rate map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
   DESIGNATED FLOODWAY. The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that
portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by
IDNR/OWR which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency
flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the loss
of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10% increase in velocities.
      (1)   The floodways are designated for Jackson Creek on the countywide
insurance rate flood map, the flood boundary and floodway map prepared by FEMA
(or the Department of Housing and Urban Development) dated September 6, 1995
and amended from time to time. When two floodway maps exist for a waterway, the
more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
      (2)   To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the
designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map
and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where
interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated
floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.
   DEVELOPMENT.
      (1)   Any human-made change to real estate, including:
         (a)   Construction, reconstruction, repair or placement of a building
or any addition to a building;
         (b)   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a
site for more than 180 days. If the travel trailer or recreational vehicle is
onsite for less than 180 days, it must be fully licensed and ready for highway
use;
         (c)   Drilling, mining, installing utilities, construction of roads,
bridges or similar projects;
         (d)   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site;
         (e)   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction;
         (f)   Construction or erection of levees, walls, fences, dams or
culverts; channel modification; filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving
or other nonagricultural alterations of the ground surface; storage of
materials; deposit of solid or liquid waste; and
         (g)   Any other activity of man that might change the direction,
height or velocity of flood or surface water, including extensive vegetation
removal.
      (2)   DEVELOPMENT does not include maintenance of existing buildings and
facilities, such as reroofing or re-surfacing of roads when there is no
increase in elevation, or gardening, plowing and similar agricultural practices
that do not involve filling, grading or construction of levees.
   ELEVATION CERTIFICATES. A form published by FEMA that is used to certify the
elevation to which a building has been elevated.
   EROSION. The general process whereby soils are moved by flowing water or
wave action.
   EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS. Organizations which are exempt from this chapter
pursuant to Illinois Compiled Statutes (ILCS), including federal, state or
local units of government.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the

1990.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FEMA. Federal Emergency Management Agency and its regulations at 44 C.F.R. §
59-79 effective as of September 29, 1989. This incorporation does not include
any later editions or amendments.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from overflow of inland or tidal waves, or the
unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

         (n)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the permit criteria of division (B)
below.
         (o)   If the designated floodway delineation, base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project, the
application will not be considered complete until IDNR/OWR has indicated
conditional approval of the designated floodway map change. No structures may
be built until a letter of map revision has been approved by FEMA.
         (p)   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by drawings
of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and existing
ground elevations and all changes in grade resulting from any proposed
excavation or filling, and floodplain and floodway limits; sealed by a
registered professional engineer, licensed architect or registered land
surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of §
154.10.
         (q)   If the proposed project involves a channel modification, the
applicant shall submit the following information:
            1.   A discussion of the purpose and need for the proposed work;
            2.   A discussion of the feasibility of using alternative locations
or methods (see division (B)(3)(i)1.) to accomplish the purpose of the proposed

            3.   An analysis of the extent and permanence of the impacts each
feasible alternative identified in division (B)(3)(i)1. below would have on the
physical and biological conditions of the water affected; and
            4.   An analysis of the impact of the proposed project, considering
cumulative effects on the physical and biological conditions of the body of
water affected.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of
all other federal, state and local permits and approvals that may be required
for this type of activity.
         (a)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s
designated representative shall not issue the development permit unless all
required federal and state permits have been obtained.
         (b)   A registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract
of the village shall review and approve applications presented under this
section.
   (B)   Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses.
      (1)   The only developments in a floodway that will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway through
use of appropriate mitigation methods as provided in this chapter. Only those
appropriate uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708, as amended will be
allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
         (a)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvement(s) related to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water-dependent uses;
         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;
         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail
systems, including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from any
one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including
open air pavilions;
         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds or other non-habitable accessory
structures without sanitary facilities that will not block flood flows nor
reduce floodway storage;
         (g)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto, if required for crossing the regulatory
floodway or access to uses in the regulatory floodway;
         (h)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
            1.   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event
will not exceed one foot; or
            2.   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility
parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events
and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all
overbank flooding events.
         (i)   Designated floodway regrading, without fill to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a watercourse;
         (j)   Flood proofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction or water tight window wells, elevating
structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the flood wall shall
be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure
and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
         (k)   The replacement, reconstruction or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased and if the building is
damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation; and
         (l)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase
the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows, including but not limited to
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios and second story additions. No enclosed
floor area may be built on stilts. If the building is improved to 50% or more
of the market value before the modification occurred, the building will be
protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      (2)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or replacement of
any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation
or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in
the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
      (3)   Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps
designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use will be
considered permissible provided that the proposed construction meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer
and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of §
154.10.
         (a)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. The calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
            1.   Designated floodway conveyance, “K” = (1.483/n) (AR213) where
“n” is Manning’s roughness factor, “A” is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and “R” is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter;
            2.   The same Manning’s “n” value shall be used for both existing
and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover; and
            3.   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream’s length;
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream’s length;
                  c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used;
               d.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-
sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties; and
               e.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be
located perpendicular to flood flows.
         (b)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase
downstream flooding.
            1.   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
            2.   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to
at least one and one-fourth times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
            3.   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
            4.   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
those excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
            5.   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant’s engineer shall demonstrate to
IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface
elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
            6.   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a
result of a floodway modification, unless the modification is necessary to
reduce flooding at the existing structure.
         (c)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
            1.   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
            2.   In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures
built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood
flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
         (d)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches.
            1.   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements.
            2.   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than one-tenth feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to
obtain a permit for a dam or waiver.
               a.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
154.06. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA Hydraulic Chart for
the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/
Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation
procedures.
               b.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for pursuant to
division (B)(3)(b) above.
               c.   Velocity increases must be mitigated pursuant to division
(B)(3)(c) above.
               d.   If the crossing is proposed over a public waterway that is
used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be
received.
               e.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the
bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
division (B).
               f.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall
be designed pursuant to division (B)(3)(h) above.
            3.   Maximum flow depths for new transverse stream crossings shall
not exceed one foot at the crown of the road during the base flood condition.
The maximum flow depth on a roadway shall not exceed six inches at the crown
for flow parallel to the roadway. For flow over a new roadway or parallel to a
new roadway, the product of the flow depth (in feet) and velocity (in feet per
second) shall not exceed four for the base flood condition.
         (e)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and
approach roads.
            1.   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
            2.   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant’s engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects of flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
            3.   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing
is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
         (f)   On stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
            1.   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot
when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within
flood easements.
            2.   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
            3.   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in §
154.03 above shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part
702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
               a.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest
by providing flood control, public recreation or regional storm water
detention;
               b.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning;
               c.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded
water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation
basin;
               d.   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
               e.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §
154.08; and
               f.   The impoundment is part of a public flood control project
with a net watershed benefit.
         (g)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures.
            1.   If the construction is required beyond the outside dimensions
of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the flood-proofing
construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the
building.
            2.   Compensation for lost storage and conveyance will not be
required for flood proofing activities.
         (h)   Excavation in the floodway.
            1.   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and
culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing
bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other
appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
            2.   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant’s engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
               a.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the length of the flooded stream;
               b.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow
section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of
one foot horizontal for every one foot of the length of the flooded stream;
               c.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical
direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of
stream length shall be used; and
               d.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream
and downstream of the transition sections.
         (i)   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it
shall be demonstrated that:
            1.   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures
from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel or the
establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification
is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water
quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
            2.   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource;
            3.   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria.
               a.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. Flood
conveyance and storage capacity of the regulatory floodplain cannot be reduced
by the channel modification.
               b.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at
both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed so that they
will prevent erosion.
               c.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of stream side (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilizing
effects of the vegetation.
               d.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
               e.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than three to one horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
               f.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. An erosion blanket or equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
               g.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom
diversity such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, those
features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and
flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
               h.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end
of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
               i.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry bed,
and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior
to diversion of water into the new channel.
               j.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
               k.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
            4.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §
154.08.
         (j)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
         (k)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in
the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
            1.   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the
maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the
time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the
initiation of improvements;
            2.   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. At a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days;
            3.   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches
and sediment traps and basins;
            4.   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see
division (B)(3)(p)). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized.
Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize
erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized
immediately; and
            5.   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with “Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois” (1988) also known as the
“Green Book” and “The Illinois Urban Manual” (NRCS, 1995).
         (l)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control
projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if
the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (m)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
            1.   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
154.06, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
            2.   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of
the proposed construction is affected by back water from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
               a.   The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
               b.   Conditions with the receiving stream at water elevations.
            3.   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
         (n)   Conditional letter of map revision.
            1.   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a CLOMR and receive from IDNR/OWR a
conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is
issued.
            2.   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
            3.   In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
            4.   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
            5.   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
         (o)   Professional engineer’s supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
         (p)   Criteria. For all activities in the floodway involving
construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be
met:
            1.   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel; and
            2.   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
         (q)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed, but
no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the “as-built”
plans.
      (4)   Development activities in delegated communities requiring state
review. For those projects listed below in a designated floodway, the following
criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior
to the issuance of a permit by a community or county delegated state permitting
authority in the floodway:
         (a)   An engineer’s analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to division (B)(3)(d) above;
         (b)   An engineer’s determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (B)(3)(e) above;
         (c)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to division (B)(3)(a), (b) and (h) above;
         (d)   The construction of any IDNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in §
154.03 above) and all other state, federal or local units of government

         (e)   An engineer’s determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening;
         (f)   Projects which revise the floodway and/or flood profiles; and
         (g)   Projects in public bodies of waters.
      (5)   Other permits.
         (a)   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §§ 5 et
seq.
         (b)   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has
delegated this responsibility to the village.
      (6)   Permits for dams.
         (a)   For any work involving the construction, modification or removal
of a dam as defined in §
154.03 pursuant to 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams),
an IDNR/OWR permit shall be obtained prior to the start of the construction.
         (b)   If the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s
designated representative finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit,
the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   If the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s
designated representative finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe
condition, the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR
Schaumburg office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
      (7)   Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer’s
review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer’s review. Those activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
         (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            1.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations;
            2.   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the
floodway;
            3.   In the case of underground stream crossings, have the top of
the pipe or encasement buried a minimum of three feet below the existing
streambed;
            4.   For overhead utility lines, will be constructed above the
estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of
an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting
towers shall be placed in the watercourse and the tower shall be designed so as
to not catch debris;
            5.   Minimize disturbance of stream side vegetation to prevent
erosion and sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the stream
banks shall be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise
stabilized upon completion of construction;
               6.   Have shut-off valves on each side of the body of water to
be crossed, if the utility crossing carries material which may cause water
pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5
(1992 State Bar Edition); or

            2.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank;
            3.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional
area of the stream channel or bank of the lake; or
            4.   Stabilization utilizing native vegetation and gradual side
slopes are evaluated as the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion
problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate
the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques,
natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as
concrete, construction rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
         (e)   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            1.   The approach roads will be a half foot or less above natural

            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert;
            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least
two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be
non-erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel;
            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction; or

   In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AO and Unnumbered A Zones) where no
floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile,
no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the
proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and
structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of
the flood waters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation.
   (A)   Development permit.
      (1)   No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by
state law, shall commence any development in a SFHA or floodplain or on

the project meets the engineering requirements of §
154.08(B)(3)(a) through (l) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of §
154.06(D).
            1.   As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering
study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to
IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a designated floodway.
            2.   Upon acceptance of the floodway by IDNR/OWR, the developer
shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of §
154.08 above for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be defined
according to the definition in §
154.03.
         (b)   A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant
first obtains a permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has
delegated permit responsibility to the village pursuant to 92 Ill. Adm. Code
Part 708 for designated floodways.
         (d)   Permits for dams.

designated representative finds a dam that does not have an IDNR/OWR permit,
the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall immediately notify the IDNR/OWR.
            3.   If the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s
designated representative identifies a dam which is believed to be in an unsafe
condition, the Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR, and
the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).

         (b)   All areas below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be constructed with waterproof material. Structures located in
a designated floodway shall be constructed and placed on a building site so as
not to block the flow of flood waters and shall also meet the appropriate use
criteria of §
154.08. In addition, all other requirements of §§
154.07,
154.08 and
154.09 must be met;
         (c)   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation;
         (d)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or flood proofed to the flood protection elevation;
         (e)   The building shall be valued at less than $7,500 and shall be
less than 500 square feet in floor size;
         (f)   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or
tools and may not contain other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or similar uses;
and
         (g)   The building shall meet the permanent opening criteria of
division (C)(3)(a) above.
      (6)   Existing buildings located within a designated floodway shall also
meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in §
154.08. Nonconforming structures located in a designated floodway may remain in
use and may only be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered in accordance
with §
154.08(B). A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other
natural or human-made disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50% of
its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this
chapter.
      (7)   Buildings constructed on property removed from the floodplain by
filling shall have their lowest habitable floors (including basements) set at
the flood protection elevation. If the builder chooses to accept the higher
risk of constructing habitable floors below the flood protection elevation, the
lowest floor may be as much as five feet below the base flood elevation,
provided the builder demonstrates compliance with the simplified approach
identified in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Technical Bulletin 10-
01.
   (D)   For public flood control projects, the floodplain management standards
will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR and the
village that each of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   Demonstrate by hydraulic and hydrologic modeling that the proposed
project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights
outside the project site or demonstrate that any increases will be contained in
easements for all flood events up to and including the base flood event;
      (2)   Demonstrate that the project will be operated and maintained by a
public agency; and
      (3)   Demonstrate that the project will reduce flood damage to an
existing building or structure.

154.07(B) and
154.09(B) shall still be met;
         (g)   The activity is not in a designated floodway; and
         (h)   The applicant’s circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general problem.
      (2)   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the area involved, including existing stream uses.
   (C)   The village shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from
the requirements of §
154.10 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
      (1)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
      (2)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that he or she will acknowledge in writing that he or she assumes the risk
and liability.
   (D)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site
or historic structure as defined in §
154.03 may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of §
154.12(B) and (C), subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; and
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(Ord. 765, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 154.13 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The village, through adoption of this chapter acknowledges the degree
of flood protection required by the ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study.
   (B)   It therefore disclaims any and all liability for risks associated with
governance of floodplain protection, including:
      (1)   Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by human-
made or natural causes;
      (2)   This chapter does not imply that development, either inside or
outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage; and
      (3)   This chapter does not create liability on the part of the village
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from
reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.
(Ord. 765, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 154.14 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions.
   (C)   Where this chapter and other ordinances, easements, covenants or deed
restrictions conflict, the ordinance, easement, covenant, deed restriction or
regulation which imposes the more stringent restrictions shall apply.
   (D)   This chapter is intended to repeal the original ordinance or
resolution which was adopted to meet the National Flood Insurance Program
regulations, but is not intended to repeal the resolution which the village
passed in order to establish initial eligibility for the program.
(Ord. 765, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 154.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a
variance resolution shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon due investigation, the Building and Zoning Administrator or the
village’s designated representative shall notify the owner in writing of the
violation.
      (1)   If an owner of property subject to the regulations of this chapter
fails to correct the violation within ten days of receipt of notice:
         (a)   The village may make application to the circuit court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or pursue other remedies as
the court deems necessary to secure compliance with the ordinance;
         (b)   The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property; and/or
         (c)   Any person who violates this chapter shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not less than $50 nor more than $1,000 for each offense. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed for each day during or upon which a
violation occurs or continues.
      (2)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s designated
representative shall inform the owner that any violation is considered a
willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a
standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
         (a)   The Building and Zoning Administrator or the village’s
designated representative is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and order the action, if necessary to
resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
         (b)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Board of Appeals. Written notice of the
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
            1.   The grounds for complaint or reasons for suspension or

§ 155.01 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this
village by Ill. Rev. Stat. (Ch. 24, §§ 1-2-1, 11-12-12, 11-30-2, 11-30-8 and
11-31-2) in order to accomplish the following purposes:
   (A)   To prevent unwise developments from increasing the flood or drainage
hazards to others;
   (B)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (C)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (D)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flooding-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue
and relief operations;
   (E)   To maintain property values and a stable tax base by minimizing the
potential for creating flood blight areas;
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the village; and
   (G)   To provide for the orderly growth and development (pursuant to the
Village Comprehensive Plan) of an environment that is especially sensitive to
changes from human activity.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.02 PROVISIONS FOR ACCOMPLISHING THE PURPOSE.
   (A)   All new development proposals in the special flood hazard areas shall
be reviewed and approved by the Village Clerk.
   (B)   The Village Clerk’s review is to ensure the following:
      (1)   New development will not change the flow of flood or other surface
drainage waters so that other properties become more susceptible to damage;
      (2)   New developments will not create special hazards or nuisances when
flooded; and
      (3)   New buildings and major improvements to existing buildings will not
be subject to damage by the base flood.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% probability of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year. The BASE FLOOD is also known as the 100-YEAR FLOOD. The base
flood elevation at any location is as defined in §
155.04 below.
   BUILDING. A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by
walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank in order that
such tanks will be constructed to the same flood damage protection standards.
The term includes a mobile home or prefabricated building which is affixed on a
permanent site and connected to the required utilities. The term does not
include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to real estate, including:
      (1)   Construction, reconstruction or placement of a building or an
addition to a building valued at more than $1,000;
      (2)   Installing a mobile home on a site or preparing a site for a mobile
home;
      (3)   Drilling, mining, installing utilities or facilities, construction
of roads, bridges or similar projects valued at more than $1,000;
      (4)   Construction or erection of levees, walls or fences;
      (5)   Filling, dredging, grading, excavating or other nonagricultural
alterations of the ground surface;
      (6)   Storage of materials; or
      (7)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
   DEVELOPMENT. Does not include:
      (1)   Maintenance of existing buildings and facilities such as re-roofing
or re-surfacing roads;
      (2)   Repairs made to a damaged building that do not change the
building’s exterior dimensions and that are valued at less than 50% of the
value of the building before the damage occurred;
      (3)   Gardening, plowing or similar agricultural practices that do not
involve filling, grading or construction of levees; or
      (4)   Agricultural development activities on farms as exempted by law.
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of inundation of normally dry land
areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of
surface waters from any source.
   FLOODWAY. That portion of the SFHA required to store and convey the base
flood. If not prohibited, building or placing obstructions in a floodway will
increase flood damages to other properties.
   FPE or FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION. The elevation of the base flood (plus one
foot) at any given location in the SFHA.
   SFHA or SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the village that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The SFHAs of the
village generally identified as such on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) of
the village prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration and dated November
3, 1982.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.04 BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   This chapter’s protection standard is the base flood according to the
best date available to the Illinois state water survey’s floodplain information
repository.
   (B)   Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, he or she may
finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with
better data and submit it to the state water survey.
      (1)   The base flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Jackson Creek, shall
be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of
the county prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration and dated May 3,
1982.
      (2)   The base flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated
as a “A Zone” on the flood insurance rate map shall be the 100-year flood depth
calculated according to the formulas presented in depth and frequency of floods
in Illinois published by the U.S. Geological Survey, 1976.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.05 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   No person, firm or corporation shall commence any development in the SFHA
without first obtaining a development permit from the Village Clerk. The
Village Clerk shall not issue a development permit if the proposed development
does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided
by the Village Clerk. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the
site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and, in those parts of
the site that are below the base flood elevation:
      (1)   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      (2)   The direction of flow of surface drainage and flood flows;
      (3)   The location of all water courses and drainage facilities;
      (4)   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and
      (5)   The elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
buildings subject to the requirements of §
154.07 below.
   (B)   Upon receipt of an application for a development permit, the Village
Clerk shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood elevation. Any
development located on land higher than the base flood elevation is not in the
SFHA and therefore not subject to the requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   The Village Clerk shall inform the applicant of any and all other
local, state and federal permits that may be required for this type of
development activity. The development permit will only be issued on the
condition that the other specified permits are obtained. The Village Clerk
shall not issue a certificate of use or occupancy unless all required permits
have been obtained.
   (D)   A filing fee for a development permit shall be $50.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.06 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES.
   (A)   No development in the SFHA shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity.
      (1)   For development proposals located in an identified floodway or
within a riverine SFHA where the floodway has not yet been identified, the
following rule shall apply: the Village Clerk shall review the development
plans to discern if:
         (a)   A new obstruction to flood flows would be created;
         (b)   The project will involve a channel crossing such as a bridge or
pipeline; or
         (c)   The project will modify the shape of the channel.
      (2)   If any of these three situations will result from the project, the
applicant shall be required to obtain a permit from the Illinois Department of
Transportation, Division of Water Resources, issued pursuant to Ill. Rev.
Stat., Ch. 19, § 70. The Village Clerk shall not issue a development permit
unless the applicant has obtained either a § 70 permit or a “waiver of permit
required” from the Division of Water Resources.
      (3)   For development proposals located in a flood fringe, “AO Zone,” of
“AH Zone” identified as such on a SFHA map or in a lakefront floodplain,
ponding area, area of sheet flow or other SFHA not subject to overbank flooding
from an identified channel, the requirement of this division (A) shall not
apply.
   (B)   No development in the SFHA shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE unless the materials are
stored in a storage tank or flood-proofed building constructed according to the
requirements of §
155.07(B)(3) below.
   (C)   New and replacement sanitary sewer lines and onsite waste disposal
systems may be permitted providing all manholes and other above ground openings
located below the FPE are watertight.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.07 PROTECTING BUILDINGS.
   (A)   In addition to the damage prevention requirements of §
155.06 above, all buildings to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from
flood damage below the FPE.
   (B)   This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:
      (1)   Construction or replacement of a new building valued at more than
$1,000;
      (2)   Improvements made to an existing building that increase the first
floor area by more than 20%;
      (3)   Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged building that are
valued at or more than 50% of the value of the building before the damage
occurred; and
      (4)   Installing a mobile home on a new site or a new mobile home on an
existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply to returning
a mobile home to the same site it formerly lawfully occupied.
   (C)   This building protection requirement may be met by any one of the
following methods:
      (1)   Any building may be constructed on permanent land fill in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   The area to be filled shall be cleared of all standing trees,
brush, down timber, trash and other growth or objects unsuitable for use as
foundation material;
         (b)   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep
before compaction;
         (c)   The surface of the fill shall be at or above the FPE. The fill
shall extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before
sloping below the FPE;
         (d)   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, rip rap or bulk-heading. If vegetative cover is
used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical;
         (e)   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage
from or onto neighboring properties;
         (f)   After the fill has been placed, the lowest floor, including
basement, must be above the FPE; and
         (g)   The Village Clerk shall maintain a record of the “as built”
elevation of the lowest floor of the building.
      (2)   Any building may be elevated in accordance with the following.
         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on stilts, piles,
walls, crawl space or other foundation that is permanently open to flood waters
and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures.
         (b)   The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored, shaped
and aligned so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as
current, waves and floating debris. All mobile homes in the SFHA shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by providing over-
the-top and frame ties to ground anchors. Specific requirements shall be that:
            1.   Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of
the mobile home, with two additional ties per side at intermediate locations
and mobile homes less than 50 feet long requiring one additional tie per side;
            2.   Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points and mobile homes less than 50
feet long requiring four additional ties per side;
            3.   All components of the anchoring system be capable of carrying
a force of 4,800 pounds; and
            4.   Any additions to the mobile homes be similarly anchored.
         (c)   All areas below the FPE shall be constructed of materials
resistant to flood damage. The bottom of the lowest floor, including joists if
any and utility meters shall be located at or above the FPE.
         (d)   The Village Clerk shall maintain a record of the “as built”
elevation of the lowest floor.
         (e)   No area below the PIT. shall be used for storage of items or
materials subject to flood damage unless such items or materials are declared
“property not covered” by a standard flood insurance policy of the National
Flood Insurance Program.
         (f)   Any future alteration of the area below the FPE that violates
the requirements of this division (C)(2) shall be deemed a violation of this
chapter. The Village Clerk shall inform the applicant that any such alteration
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore will cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
         (g)   No mobile home may be placed on a new site located within an
identified floodway.
      (3)   A nonresidential building may be floodproofed below the hit, in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   A registered professional engineer shall certify that the
building has been designed so that below the FPE, the structure and attendant
utility facilities are water-tight and capable of resisting the effects of the
base flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of
buoyancy, and impacts frail debris or ice;
         (b)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity; and
         (c)   The Village Engineer shall maintain the engineer’s certificate
and a record of the “as built” elevation to which the building was
floodproofed.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.08 OTHER DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The Village Board shall take into account flood hazards, to the extent that
they are known, in all official actions related to land management, use and
development.
   (A)   New subdivision, mobile home parks and planned unit developments
(PUDs) shall meet the requirements of §§
155.06 and
155.07 above. Plats or plans for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and
planned unit developments (PUDs) shall include a signed statement by a
registered professional engineer that the plat or plans account for changes in
the drainage of surface waters in accordance with the Plat Act (Ill. Rev.
Stat., 1979, Ch. 109, par. 2).
   (B)   Plats or plans for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned
unit developments (PUDs) shall display the following flood data:
      (1)   The boundary of the SFHA;
      (2)   The boundary of the floodway, if shown on available SFHA maps;
      (3)   Easements of lands dedicated to the village for access for channel
maintenance purposes; and
      (4)   The FPE for each building site. Where the base flood elevation is
not available from an existing study filed with the State Water Survey, the

§ 155.09 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Zoning Board of
Appeals for a variance.
   (B)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the applicant’s request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the Village Board.
      (1)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:
         (a)   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
         (b)   A substantial economic hardship would result if the variance was
not granted;
         (c)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
         (d)   There will be no additional threat to public health or safety or
creation of a nuisance;
         (e)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing or repairs to roads, utilities or other
public facilities; and
         (f)   The provisions of §
155.05(C) of this chapter can still be met.
      (2)   The Village Clerk shall notify an applicant in writing that a
variance from the requirements of §
155.07 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks
and that he will acknowledge in writing that he or she assumes the risk and
liability.
      (3)   A variance from the requirements of §
155.07 may be granted to permit a “wet floodproofed” building; that is, a
building to be intentionally flooded during a flood, provided:
         (a)    No part of such a building below the FPE may be subject to
flood damage;
         (b)   The variance shall be conditioned on the contents being:
            1.   Of materials resistant to flood damage;
            2.   Items declared “property not covered” by a standard flood
insurance policy of the National Flood Insurance Program; or
            3.   Readily moveable to a place of protection during a flood
provided there will be personnel available and adequate warning.
         (c)   Any future alteration of the area below the FPE, that violates
the conditions of the variance shall be deemed a violation of ordinance. The
Village Clerk shall inform the applicant that any such alteration is considered
a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore will cause coverage by a
standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (4)   Variances requested in connection with restoration of a site or
building documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois Department of
Conservation may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of division (B)(1) above.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.10 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes.
   (B)   This chapter does not imply that development either inside or outside
of the SFHA will be free from flooding or damage.
   (C)   This chapter does not create liability on the part of the village or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance
on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.11 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
other ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflicts or overlaps,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. 377, passed 10-4-1982)
§ 155.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   The Village Clerk may determine upon due investigation that a
violation of minimum standards of this chapter exists and after the owner fails
after ten days notice to correct his or her property, the village may make
application to the Circuit Court for an injunction requiring conformance with
this chapter or make such other order as the court sees necessary to secure
compliance with the ordinance.
   (B)   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof be
fined not less than $25 nor more than $200. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.
Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance
resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Nothing herein
shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or
remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person
or persons responsible.

   (A)   It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to promote the health,
safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of the village
and downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection, preservation,
proper maintenance and use of village watercourses, lakes, ponds, floodplain
and wetland areas.
   (B)   The chapter is more specifically adopted:
      (1)   To prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood water storage
capacity;
      (2)   To maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams, floodplains,
ponds, lakes, wetlands and groundwater by storing and providing for
infiltration of wet-period runoff in floodplains and wetlands, and releasing it
slowly to the stream to maintain in-stream flow;
      (3)   To manage storm water runoff and maintain natural runoff conveyance
systems, and minimize the need for major storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;
      (4)   To improve water quality, both by filtering and storing sediments
and attached pollutants, nutrients and organic compounds before they drain into
streams or wetlands, and by maintaining the natural pollutant-assimilating
capabilities of streams, floodplains and wetlands;
      (5)   To protect shorelines and stream banks from soil erosion, using
natural means and materials wherever possible;
      (6)   To protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding grounds;
      (7)   To protect wildlife habitat;
      (8)   To preserve areas of special recreational, scenic or scientific
interest, including natural areas and habitats of endangered species;
      (9)   To maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of developing
areas; and
      (10)   To encourage the continued economic growth and high quality of
life of the village which depends in part on an adequate quality of water, a
pleasing natural environment and recreational opportunities in proximity to the
village.
   (C)   In order to achieve the purpose and intent of this chapter, the
village hereby designates the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District which shall
be considered as an overlay to the zoning districts created by village zoning
ordinances as amended. (See §
156.01).
   (D)   Any proposed development activity within the district must obtain a
special use permit as approved by the governing body of the village. (See §
156.05).
(Ord. 570, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 156.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ARMORING. A form of channel modification which involves the placement of
materials (concrete, riprap, bulkheads and the like) within a stream channel or
along a shore line to protect property above streams, lakes and ponds from
erosion and wave damage caused by wave action and stream flow.
   BULKHEAD. A retaining wall that protects property along water.
   CHANNEL. A natural or artificial watercourse of perceptible extent that
periodically or continuously contains moving water, or which forms a connecting
link between two bodies of water. It has a definite bed and banks that serve to
contain the water.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION or CHANNELIZATION. To alter a watercourse by changing
the physical dimension or materials of the channel. CHANNEL MODIFICATION
includes damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening,
straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of bottom or woody
vegetation. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of debris or
trash from the watercourse. CHANNELIZATION is a severe form of channel
modification involving a significant change in the channel cross-section and
typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g. straightening).
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of storm water
runoff that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and
downstream water surface elevation.
   CULVERT. A structure designed to carry drainage water or small streams below
barriers such as roads, driveways or railway embankments.
   DEPRESSIONAL AREA. Any area which is lower in elevation on all sides than
surrounding properties (i.e. does not drain freely), or whose drainage is
severely limited such as by a restrictive culvert. A DEPRESSIONAL area will
fill with water on occasion when runoff into it exceeds the rate of
infiltration into underlying soil or exceeds the discharge through its
controlled outlet. Large DEPRESSIONAL areas may provide significant storm water
or floodplain storage.
   DEVELOPMENT. The carrying out of any building, agricultural or mining
operation, or the making of any change in the use or appearance of land, and
the dividing of land into two or more parcels. The following activities or uses
shall constitute, for the purposes of this subchapter, to involve development
as defined herein:
      (1)   Any construction, reconstruction or alteration of a structure to
occupy more or less ground area or the onsite preparation for same;
      (2)   Any change in the intensity of use of land, such as an increase in
the number of dwelling units on land, or a material increase in the site
coverage of businesses, manufacturing establishments, offices, and dwelling
units, including mobile homes, campers and recreational vehicles, on land;
      (3)   Any agricultural use of land including, but not limited to, the use
of land in horticulture, floriculture, forestry, dairy, livestock, poultry,
beekeeping, pisciculture and all forms of farm products and farm production;
      (4)   The commencement of drilling, except to obtain soil samples, or the
commencement of mining, filling, excavation, dredging, grading or other
alterations of the topography;
      (5)   Demolition of a structure or redevelopment of a site;
      (6)   Clearing of land as an adjunct of construction for agricultural,
private residential, commercial or industrial use;
      (7)   Deposit of refuse, solid or liquid waste, or fill on a parcel of
land, or the storage of materials;
      (8)   Construction, excavation or fill operations relating to the
creation or modification of any road, street, parking facility or any drainage
canal, or to the installation of utilities or any other grading activity that
alters the existing topography;
      (9)   Construction or erection of dams, levees, walls, fences, bridges or
culverts; and
      (10)   Any other activity that might change the direction, height or
velocity of flood or surface waters.
   DISTRICT. The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District as defined in §
156.06.
   EROSION. The general process whereby soils are moved by flowing water or
wave action.
   FILTERED VIEW. The maintenance or establishment of woody vegetation of
sufficient density to screen developments from a stream or wet land, to provide
for streambank stabilization and erosion control, to serve as an aid to
infiltration of surface runoff, and to provide cover to shade the water. The
vegetation need not be so dense as to completely block the view. FILTERED VIEW
means no clear cutting.
   FLOODPLAIN. The land adjacent to a body of water with ground surface
elevations at or below the 100-year frequency flood elevation.
   FLOODWAY. The portion of the floodplain (sometimes referred to as the base
floodplain or special flood hazard area) required to store and convey the base
flood. The FLOODWAY is the 100-year floodway as designated and regulated by the
State Department of Transportation/Division of Water Resources. The remainder
of the floodplain which is outside the regulatory floodway is referred to as
the flood fringe or floodway fringe.
   HYDRAULIC CHARACTERISTICS. The features of a watercourse which determine its
water conveyance capacity. These features include but are not limited to: size
and configuration of the cross-section of the watercourse and floodway; texture
and roughness of materials along the watercourse; alignment of watercourse;
gradient of watercourse; amount and type of vegetation within the watercourse;
and size, configuration and other characteristics of structures within the
watercourse. In low-lying area, the characteristics of the overbank area also
determine water conveyance capacity.
   LAKE or POND. Any inland waterbody, fed by spring or surface water flow.
   LOT. An area of land, with defined boundaries, that is designated in
official assessor’s records as being one parcel.
   NATURAL. In reference to watercourses, those stream channels, grassed
waterways and swales formed by the existing surface topography of the earth

meandering path; its floodplain is not constrained by levees; the area near the
bank has not been cleared, mowed or cultivated; the stream flows over soil and
geologic materials typical of the area with no alteration of the course or
cross-section of the stream caused by filling or excavating.
   ORDINARY HIGH WATER MARK (OHWM). The point on the bank or shore up to which
the presence and action of surface water is so continuous so as to leave a
distinctive mark such as by erosion, destruction or prevention of terrestrial
vegetation, predominance of aquatic vegetation, or other easily recognized
characteristics.
   QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL. A person trained in one or more of the disciplines
of biology, geology, soil science, engineering or hydrology whose training and
experience ensure a competent analysis and assessment of stream, lake, pond and
wetland conditions and impacts.

soil or plant material and which runs off the land.
   SEDIMENTATION. The processes that deposit soils, debris and other materials
either on other ground surfaces or in water bodies or watercourses.
   SETBACK. The horizontal distance between any portion of a structure or any
development activity and the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or
intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond, or the
edge of a wetland, measured from the structure’s or development’s closest point
to the ordinary high water mark, or edge.
   STREAM. A body of running water flowing continuously or intermittently in a
channel on or below the surface of the ground. Seven and one-half minute
topographic maps of the U.S. Geological Survey are one reference for
identifying perennial and intermittent streams. For purposes of this chapter,
the term STREAM does not include storm sewers.
   STRUCTURE. Anything that is constructed, erected or moved to or from any
premise which is located above, on or below the ground including, but not
limited to roads, signs, billboards and mobile homes. Temporary recreational
facilities including, but not limited to, tents, camper trailers and recreation
vehicles are not considered STRUCTURES when used less than 180 days per year
and located landward of the minimum setback provided as a natural vegetation
strip.
   VEGETATION. All plant growth, especially trees, shrubs, mosses and grasses.
   WATERCOURSE. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, slough, gulch, draw, ditch, channel, conduit, culvert,

drainageway, which has a definite channel, bed and banks, in or into which
storm water runoff and floodwater flow either regularly or intermittently.
   WETLAND. Those transitional lands between terrestrial and aquatic system
where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered
by shallow water. Classification of areas as WETLANDS shall follow the
Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States as
published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS/OBS-79/31).

be reviewed and acted upon according to the following procedures:
      (1)   The village will review each application for a special use permit
to determine its conformance with the provisions of this chapter. The village
may also refer any application to the Will - South Cook Soil and Water
Conservation District and/or any other local government or public agency within
whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comments. Within 30 days
after receiving an application, the village shall in writing:
         (a)   Approve the permit application, if it is found to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and issue the permit;
         (b)   Approve the permit application subject to reasonable conditions
as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this chapter, and
issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
         (c)   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies
and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
      (2)   Failure of the village to act on an original or revised application
within 30 days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed in
accordance with the plans as filed, unless the time is extended by agreement
between the village and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a

(Ord. 570, passed 12-7-1988)
§ 156.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS; AREA AFFECTED.
   This chapter applies to development in or near streams, lakes, ponds and
wetlands within the village. Streams, lakes and ponds (including intermittent
streams) are those which are shown on the United States Department of the
Interior Geological Survey (USGS) seven and one-half minute quadrangle maps and
those additional streams, lakes and ponds delineated on maps adopted as part of
this chapter. Those maps are hereby made a part of this chapter, and two copies
thereof shall remain on file in the office of the Village Administrator for
public inspection. Within the jurisdiction of the village, those waterbodies
and watercourses that are named and are subject to the provisions of this
chapter are Jackson Creek, Grant Creek and their tributaries. Wetlands are
those designated in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Illinois Department of
Conservation wetland inventory and those additional wetlands delineated on maps
adopted as part of this chapter. If new drainage courses, lakes, ponds or
wetlands are created as part of a development, the requirements for setbacks
and uses within setbacks, and the criteria for watercourse relocation and minor
modification shall apply. The district shall be amended as appropriate to
include these areas.
   (A)   The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District.
      (1)   The Lowland Conservancy Overlay District shall be considered as an
overlay to the zoning districts created by the Village Zoning Ordinance as
amended in addition to the requirements of this chapter, applicants for a
special use permit within the district shall meet all requirements of the
underlying zoning districts.
      (2)   In the event of a conflict between the overlay district
requirements and the underlying zoning district requirements, the most
restrictive requirements prevail.
   (B)   District boundary. The procedures, standards and requirements
contained in this chapter shall apply to all lots within wetlands and streams,
and all lots lying wholly or in part:
      (1)   Within the special flood hazard area (SFHA) designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA);
      (2)   Within 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) of a
perennial stream or intermittent stream, the ordinary high water mark of a lake
or pond, or the edge of a wetland; or
      (3)   Within depressional areas serving as floodplain or storm water
storage areas.
   (C)   Minimum setback of development activity from streams, lakes, ponds and
wetlands.
      (1)   Absolutely no development activity (except as provided below) may
occur within the minimum setback which is defined as 25 feet from the ordinary
high water mark of streams, lakes and ponds, or the edge of wetlands, or within
designated depressional areas. In no case shall the setback be less than the
boundary of the 100-year floodway as defined by FEMA. These setback
requirements do not apply to a stream in a culvert unless the stream is taken
out of the culvert as part of development activity. If a culvert functions as a
low-flow culvert, where water is intended to periodically flow over it, the
setback requirements apply.
      (2)   The following development activities may be permitted, subject to
issuance of a special use permit, within the minimum setback areas only if, as
a practical matter, they cannot be located outside the setback area. The
development activities will only be approved based upon a report, prepared by a
qualified professional, which demonstrates that they will not adversely affect
water quality; destroy, damage or disrupt significant habitat area; adversely
affect drainage and/or storm water retention capabilities; adversely affect
flood conveyance and storage; lead to unstable earth conditions, create erosion
hazards, or be materially detrimental to any other property in the area of the
subject property or to the village as a whole, including the loss of open space
or scenic vistas:
         (a)   Minor improvements such as walkways, benches, comfort stations,
informational displays, directional signs, foot bridges, observation decks and
docks;
         (b)   The maintenance, repair, replacement and reconstruction of
existing highways and bridges, electrical transmission and telecommunication
lines, poles and towers; and
         (c)   The establishment and development of public and private parks
and recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic natural and scientific
areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife improvement projects, game bird and
animal farms, wildlife preserves and public boat launching ramps.
      (3)   Review of the proposed development activity within the minimum
setback area will consider the following.
         (a)   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the
development of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches or the development
of park shelters or similar structures is allowed. The development and
maintenance of roads, parking lots and other impervious surfaces necessary for
permitted uses are allowed only on a very limited basis, and where no alternate
location outside of the setback area is available.
         (b)   Land surface modification within the minimum setback shall be
permitted for the development of storm water drainage swales between the
developed area of the site (including a storm water detention facility on the
site) and a stream, lake or pond, or wetland. Detention basins within the
setback are generally discouraged, unless it can be shown that resultant
modifications will not impair water quality, habitat or flood storage
functions.
         (c)   No filling or excavating within wetlands is permitted except to
install piers for the limited development of walkways and observation decks.
Walkways and observation decks should avoid high quality wetland areas, and
should not adversely affect natural areas designated in the Illinois Natural
Areas Inventory or the habitat of rare or endangered species.
         (d)   Wetland area occupied by the development of decks and walkways
must be mitigated by an equal area of wetland habitat improvement.
         (e)   Modification of degraded wetlands for purposes of storm water
management is permitted where the quality of the wetland is improved and total
wetland acreage is preserved. Where the modification is permitted, wetlands
shall be protected from the effects of increased storm water runoff by measures
such as detention or sedimentation basins, vegetated swales and buffer strips,
and sediment and erosion control measures on adjacent developments. The direct
entry of storm sewers into wetlands shall be avoided. Environmental impact
analysis of wetland modification may be required in accordance with §
156.08.
      (4)   An applicant for a special use permit (see §
156.05) must stabilize areas left exposed after land surface modification with
vegetation normally associated with that stream or wetland. The planting of
native riparian vegetation is recommended as the preferred stabilization
measure. Other techniques should be used only when and where vegetation fails
to control erosion. The preferred alternative is riprap, using natural rock
materials where practicable, installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that
provides interstitial space for vegetative growth and habitat for
macroinvertebrates and other stream organisms. Lining of the stream channel
bottom is not permitted.
      (5)   The applicant shall minimize access to the applicant’s proposed
development activity within all or part of the Lowland Conservancy Overlay
District where the access could adversely affect the stream, lake, pond,
wetland or related environmentally-sensitive areas.
   (D)   Site development plan.
      (1)   A site development plan must be prepared for any proposed
development within, or partly within, the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District
and must indicate:
         (a)   Dimension and area of parcel, showing also the vicinity of the
site in sufficient detail to enable easy location, in the field, of the site
for which the special use permit is sought, and including the boundary line,
underlying zoning, a legend, a scale and a north arrow. (This requirement may
be satisfied by the submission of a separate vicinity map);
         (b)   Location of any existing and proposed structures;
         (c)   Location of existing or proposed onsite sewage systems or
private water supply systems;
         (d)   Location of any perennial or intermittent stream, lake or pond,
and its ordinary high water mark;
         (e)   Location and landward limit of all wetlands;
         (f)   Location of setback lines as defined in this chapter;
         (g)   Location of the 100-year floodway;
         (h)   Location of existing or future access roads;
         (i)   Specifications and dimensions of stream, wetland or other water
areas proposed for alterations;
         (j)   Cross-sections and calculations indicating any changes in flood
storage volumes; and
         (k)   Other information as reasonably requested by the village.
      (2)   The applicant shall present evidence, prepared by a qualified
professional, that demonstrates that the proposed development activity will not
endanger health and safety, including danger from the obstruction or diversion
of flood flow.
      (3)   The developer shall also show, by submitting appropriate
calculations and resource inventories, that the proposed development activity
will not substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy
valuable habitat for aquatic or other flora and fauna, adversely affect water
quality or ground water resources, increase storm water runoff velocity so that
water levels on other lands are substantially raised or the danger from
flooding increased, or adversely impact any other natural stream, floodplain or
wetland functions, and is otherwise consistent with the intent of this chapter.
   (E)   Geologic and soil characteristics/geologic and soil report.
      (1)   The site proposed for development shall be investigated to
determine the soil and geologic characteristics, including soil erosion
potential. A report, prepared by a licensed professional engineer, geoscientist
or soil scientist experienced in the practice of geologic and soil mechanics,
may be requested by the village for land development within the Lowland
Conservancy Overlay District.
      (2)   This report shall include a description of soil type and stability
of surface and subsurface conditions. Any area which the investigation
indicates as being subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not be subjected
to development, unless the engineer or soil scientist can demonstrate
conclusively that these hazards can be overcome.
   (F)   Hydrologic controls/drainage control plan.
      (1)   A drainage control plan that describes the hydraulic
characteristics of onsite and nearby watercourses as well as the proposed
drainage plan, prepared by a registered professional engineer experienced in
hydrology and hydraulics, shall be submitted with each application for land
development within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District.
      (2)   Unless otherwise noted, the following restrictions, requirements
and standards shall apply to all development within the Lowland Conservancy
Overlay District:
         (a)   Natural open-channel drainageways shall be preserved; and
         (b)   Runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g., roofs,
driveways, streets, patios and the like) shall be collected and transported to
a drainageway (preferably a natural drainageway) with sufficient capacity to
accept the discharge without undue erosion or detrimental impact. Vegetated
drainage swales are preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other
manufactured materials.

prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land surface into a stream,
lake, pond or wetland. All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be
located as far as possible from a stream, lake, pond or wetland.
      (6)   The village may limit development activity in or near a stream,
lake, pond or wetland to specific months, and to a maximum number of continuous
days or hours, in order to minimize adverse impacts. Also, the village may
require that equipment be operated from only one side of a stream, lake or pond
in order to minimize bank disruption. Other development techniques, conditions
and restrictions may be required in order to minimize adverse impacts on
streams, lakes, ponds or wetlands, and on any related areas not subject to
development activity.
   (H)   Natural vegetation buffer strip required; vegetation and revegetation/
landscape plan.
      (1)   To minimize erosion, stabilize the stream bank, protect water
quality, maintain water temperature at natural levels, preserve fish and
wildlife habitat, to screen human-made structures, and also to preserve
aesthetic values of the natural water course and wetland areas, a natural
vegetation strip shall be maintained along the edge of the stream, lake, pond
or wetland.
      (2)   The natural vegetation strip shall extend landward a minimum of 25
feet from the ordinary high water mark of a perennial or intermittent stream,
lake or pond and the edge of wetland.
      (3)   Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may be
selectively pruned or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to achieve a
filtered view of the waterbody from the principal structure and for reasonable
private access to the stream, lake, pond or wetland. The pruning and removal
activities shall ensure that a live root system stays intact to provide for
streambank stabilization and erosion control.
      (4)   A landscape plan, prepared by a professional landscape architect,
shall be submitted with each special use permit application for development
activity within the Lowland Conservancy Overlay District and contain the
following:
         (a)   A plan describing the existing vegetative cover of the property
and showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part of the
proposed construction; and
         (b)   A plan describing the proposed revegetation of disturbed areas
specifying the materials to be used.
      (5)   The vegetation must be planned in such a way that access for stream
maintenance purposes shall not be prevented.

permitted because these activities are not usually consistent with the purposes
of this chapter.
   (B)   Possible permission. Under certain circumstances, relocation and minor
modification may be permitted through a special use permit where certain
problems can be mitigated by relocation and/or minor modification, specifically
when:
      (1)   Offsite hydrologic conditions are causing erosion, flooding and
related problems;
      (2)   Onsite soil and geologic conditions are resulting in unstable
conditions that pose hazards to life, health and existing structures or
property;
      (3)   The quality of previously modified or relocated streams can be
improved through restoration;
      (4)   Officially adopted storm water management plans call for placement
of detention or retention facilities in a stream; or
      (5)   Public utilities, including sanitary sewers, pipelines and roadways
require stream crossing or relocation where there are not practical
alternatives.
   (C)   Modification. Modification of watercourses as a convenience for site
design purposes is not permitted.
   (D)   Conditions and restrictions for permitting stream modification. Stream
modification, when permitted, is subject to the following conditions and
restrictions:
      (1)   Water quality, habitat and other natural functions must be
significantly improved by the modification; no significant habitat area may be
destroyed;
      (2)   The amount of flow and velocity of a stream is not to be increased
or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject property, unless this
reflects an improvement over previous conditions in terms of reduced flooding,
reduced erosion or enhanced lowflow conditions;
      (3)   Prior to diverting water into a new channel, a qualified
professional approved by the village shall inspect the stream modification, and
issue a written report to the village that the modified stream complies with
the requirements in division (E) below; and
      (4)   Stream channel enlargement, or other modifications that would
increase conveyance, shall not be permitted if the intended purpose is to
accommodate development activities in the floodplain.
   (E)   Required content of stream modification, relocation plan. Stream
relocation may be permitted in accordance with a stream relocation plan which
provides for:
      (1)   The creation of a natural meander pattern, pools, riffles and
substrate;

      (11)   Establishment of a low-flow channel which reflects the conditions
of a natural stream.
   (F)   Criteria for permitting armoring of channels and banks. Armoring in
the form of bulkheads, riprap or other materials or devices is not permitted
except in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Significant erosion cannot be prevented in any other way and the
use of vegetation and gradual bank slopes has not sufficiently stabilized the
shoreline or bank;
      (2)   The bulkhead or other device is not placed within a wetland, or
between a wetland and a lake or pond;
      (3)   The bulkhead, riprap or other device will minimize the transmittal
of wave energy or currents to other properties; and
      (4)   The change in the horizontal or vertical, configuration of the land
must be kept to a minimum where permission to install bulkheads or other
armoring devices is requested as part of the special use permit application
documentation and certification pertaining to the items above must be
submitted.
   (G)   Criteria for permitting the use of culverts. Culverts are not
permitted in streams except in accordance with the following:
      (1)   Where a culvert is necessary for creating access to a property; use
of culverts as a convenience, in order to facilitate general site design, is
not to be considered;
      (2)   The culvert must allow passage of fish inhabiting the stream, and
accommodate the 100-year flood event without increasing upstream flooding,
except where a restricting culvert is desirable as part of an overall storm and
floodwater management plan;
      (3)   The culvert must be maintained free of debris and sediment to allow
free passage of water, and if applicable, fish; and
      (4)   The stream bottom should not be significantly widened for the
placement of a culvert as this increases siltation; if multiple culverts must
be installed, one culvert should be at the level of the bottom of the stream
and the others at or above normal water elevation.
   (H)   Criteria for permitting on-stream impoundments. Impoundment of streams
is not permitted except in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing regional storm water detention, flood control or public recreation;
      (2)   The impoundment will not prevent the upstream migration of
indigenous fish species;
      (3)   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants;
      (4)   Impoundments without permanent low-flow pools are preferred except
where a permanent pool is necessary to achieve the intended benefits of the
impoundment (e.g. recreation or water quality mitigation);
      (5)   Impoundment design shall include gradual bank slopes, appropriate
bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; and
      (6)   Impoundment complies with the Village Storm water Drainage and

§ 157.03 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   The approaches outlined here have been proven effective in minimizing soil
erosion from development sites and in reducing the damaging effects of that
erosion which does occur. They should serve as guidelines for the preparation
of site development activities which are exempted from the permit requirements
of this chapter.
   (A)   Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site
so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where
high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever practical, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as practical.
   (B)   Natural vegetation should be retained and protected where practical.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds and wetlands
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
   (C)   Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resulting from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond
or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas
to erosion and sedimentation.
   (D)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (E)   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters
from land undergoing development.
   (F)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and
benefits involved.
   (G)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered.
   (H)   Provision should be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainage
way should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant
velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion onsite or
downstream.
   (I)   Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development.
   (J)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   (K)   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be
properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   (L)   All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment
from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
(Ord. 766, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 157.04 EROSION CONTROL PERMIT.
   (A)   Permit required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no
person shall commence or perform any clearing, grading, stripping, excavating
or filling of land which meets the following provisions without having first
obtained an erosion control permit from the village.

excavation, fill or any combination thereof) that will affect an area in excess
of 5,000 square feet;
      (2)   Any land disturbing activity that will affect an area in excess of
500 square feet if the activity is within 25 feet of a lake, pond, stream or
wetland; or
      (3)   Excavation, fill or any combination thereof that will exceed 100
cubic yards.
   (B)   Exceptions.
      (1)   A permit shall not be required for any of the following provided

whose jurisdiction the site is located for review and comment. Within 30 days
after receiving an application, the village shall in writing:
         (a)   Approve the permit application if it is found to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and issue the permit;
         (b)   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this
chapter, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
         (c)   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies
and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
      (2)   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
         (a)   The development, including but not limited to subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the village where applicable;
         (b)   The permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the village;
         (c)   The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the village for the area in which
the site is situated; and
         (d)   All relevant federal and state permits (i.e., for floodplains
and wetlands) have been received for the portion of the site subject to soil
disturbance.
      (3)   Failure of the village to act on a complete original or revised
application within 30 days of receipt shall authorize the applicant to proceed
in accordance with the plans as filed unless the time is extended by agreement
between the village and the applicant. Pending preparation and approval of a
revised plan, development activities shall be allowed to proceed in accordance
with conditions established by the village.
   (G)   Expiration or permit. Every erosion control permit shall expire and
become null and void if the work authorized by the permit has not been
commenced within 180 days, or is not completed by a date which shall be
specified in the permit; except that the village may, if the permittee presents
satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented the work being
commenced or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable
extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of
the permit. The village may require modification of the erosion control plan to
prevent any increase in erosion or off site sediment runoff resulting from any
time extension.
   (H)   Appeals. The applicant, or any person or agency which received notice
of the filing of the application, may appeal the decision of the village as
provided in division (F) above, to the Board of Appeals. Upon receipt of an
appeal, the Board of Appeals shall schedule and hold a public hearing, after
giving 15 days notice thereof. The Board of Appeals shall render a decision
within 30 days after the hearing. The factors to be considered on review shall
include, but need not be limited to the effects of the proposed development
activities on the surface water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any
comprehensive watershed management plans, or the use of any retention
facilities; possible saturation of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both
natural and domestic; runoff surface waters that produce erosion and silting of
drainage ways; nature and type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the
proposed development activities may create earth movement and produce slopes
that cannot be landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the
natural landscape through grading or removal of vegetation.

§ 157.05 DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability. All clearing, grading, stripping, excavating and
filling which is subject to the permit requirements of this chapter shall be
subject to the applicable standards and requirements set forth in this section.
   (B)   Responsibility. The permittee shall not be relieved of responsibility
for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law, and the village or
its officers or agents will not be made liable for the damage, by:
      (1)   The issuance of a permit under this chapter;
      (2)   Compliance with the provisions of that permit or with conditions
attached to it by the village;
      (3)   Failure of the village officials to observe or recognize hazardous
or unsightly conditions;
      (4)   Failure of the village officials to recommend denial or to actually
deny a permit; or
      (5)   Exemptions from the permit requirements of this chapter.
   (C)   Site design requirements.
      (1)   Onsite sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
         (a)   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, strawbales or equivalent control measures) shall be
constructed to control all offsite runoff specified in referenced handbooks.
Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of 25 feet, may be used as an
alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
         (b)   For disturbed areas draining more than one but less than five
acres, an equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope
point of the disturbed area.
         (c)   For disturbed areas draining more than five acres, a sediment
basin or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point
of the disturbed area.
         (d)   Sediment basins and sediment traps shall provide for both
detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be composed
of equal volumes of “wet” detention storage and “dry” detention storage and
each shall be sized for the two-year, 24-hour runoff from the site under
maximum runoff conditions during construction. The release rate of the basin
shall be that rate required to achieve minimum detention times of at least ten
hours. The elevation of the outlet structure shall be placed such that it only
drains the dry detention storage.
         (e)   The required sediment storage volume may be calculated using the
Universal Soil Loss Equation or from Figure 6-20 in the Green Book.
      (2)   Conveyance channels, because of the presence of concentrated flows
typically having high velocities, warrant special consideration. Diversion
channels, which are intended to route offsite flows away from disturbed areas,
should be constructed as soon as possible in the construction process.
         (a)   For grades up to 4%, seeding in combination with mulch, erosion
blanket or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion
blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
         (b)   For grades of 4% to 8%, sod or an equivalent control measure
shall be applied in the channel.
         (c)   For grades greater than 8%, rock, riprap or an equivalent
control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced
using drop structures.
      (3)   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within three calendar days following the end of active disturbance, or
redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding and/or non-vegetative measures; and
         (b)   Areas having slopes greater than 12% shall be stabilized with
sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent.
      (4)   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided,
where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
         (a)   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to
the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed of non-erosive material, such as
riprap or gravel;
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be
kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
restabilized within 48 hours after channel disturbance is completed,
interrupted or stopped;
         (c)   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall
be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized channel before flow is diverted;
and
         (d)   Temporary stream crossings of intermittent and perennial streams
used only for and during construction shall be designed to convey a two-year
flood (minimum) or other flood event approved by the village or its designee
without overtopping unless a more frequent design event is allowed by the
village or its designee. The entire crossings shall be designed to withstand
hydrodynamic and erosive forces up to the base flood event without washing out.
Ephemeral streams may be crossed at temporary at-grade crossings provided that
the crossing point is stabilized with materials resistive to the erosive forces
produced by runoff from upstream drainage areas, and the design is approved by
the village or its designee. Temporary stream crossings shall be removed upon
completion of construction activities. All temporary stream crossings shall be
completely removed and the stream restored to its preconstruction condition
upon completion of construction. Restoration shall incorporate appropriate
vegetation consistent with the adjacent existing vegetation prior to
construction or in accordance with a restoration plan approved by the village
or its designee.
      (5)   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment
traps or filter barriers that meet acceptable design standards and
specifications that will not cause flooding in public streets.
      (6)   Soil storage piles containing more than ten cubic yards of material
shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than 25 feet to a
roadway or drainage channel. Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter
fence or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the downslope side of
the piles. Soil storage piles cannot be located in areas subject to frequent
inundation.
      (7)   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
      (8)   Each site shall have graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads,
access drives, and parking areas of sufficient length and width to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any sediment
reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street
cleaning (not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a
controlled sediment disposal area.
      (9)   All the temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control
practices must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective
performance of their intended function. The permittee or his or her designee
must inspect the sediment and erosion control measures weekly and after half an
inch or greater of rainfall. Repairs and modifications will be reviewed by the
village or its designee.
      (10)   All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
disposed within 30 days after final site stabilization is achieved with
permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other disturbed
soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
      (11)   The condition of the construction site for the winter shut down
period shall address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall
growing season so that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with
temporary and/or permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain
idle throughout the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measures
including temporary seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior
to the end of the fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of
the growing season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not
rely on vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching.
      (12)   All run off from disturbed areas onsite must pass through sediment
control facilities.
   (D)   Handbooks adopted by reference. The standards and specifications
contained in the “Illinois Urban Manual” and the “Illinois Procedures and
Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control” (the Green Book)
cited in §
157.04, are hereby incorporated into this division (D) and made a part hereof
by reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation
under site development and erosion and sedimentation control plans approved
under §
157.04. In the event of conflict between provisions of the manuals and this
chapter, the ordinance shall govern.
   (E)   Maintenance of control measures. All soil erosion and sediment control
measures necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained
periodically by the applicant or subsequent land owner during the period of
land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure
adequate performance.
   (F)   Inspection. The village shall make periodic inspections and shall
notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with the erosion control
plans or the site development plans as approved.
   (G)   Special precautions.
      (1)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site the village
or their designee determines by inspection that the nature of the site is such
that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland or drainage structure, the village
or their designee may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done,
that such reasonable special precautions be taken as is considered advisable to
avoid the likelihood of the peril. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS may include, but shall
not be limited to a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a registered soils
engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for
further work.
      (2)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading
on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee
required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be
required to protect adjoining land or the general public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village may specify
the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the
operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of
protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
   (H)   Amendment of plans. Major amendments of the site development or
erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the village and
shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the
original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by the
village by written authorization to the permittee.
(Ord. 766, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 157.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Exceptions. The Board of Appeals may, in accordance with the following
procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set
forth in this chapter:
      (1)   Application for any exception shall be made by a verified petition
of the applicant for an erosion control permit, stating fully the grounds of
the petition and the facts relied upon by the applicant. The petition shall be
filed with the erosion control permit application. In order for the petition to
be granted, it shall be necessary that the Board of Appeals find all of the
following facts with respect to the land referred in the petition:
         (a)   The land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to the title limitations of record, that it
is impossible or impractical for the applicant to comply with all of the
requirements of this chapter;
         (b)   The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of
a substantial property right of the applicant; and
         (c)   The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject
property.
      (2)   Each application for an exception shall be referred to the village
for review. The village shall transmit its recommendations to the Board of
Appeals, which shall review the recommendations prior to granting or denying
the exception.
      (3)   The Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each
application for exception, within 30 days after receiving application, in the
manner provided with respect to appeals. After public hearing, the Board of
Appeals may approve the erosion control permit application with the exceptions
and conditions it deems necessary or it may disapprove the erosion control
permit application and application for exception or it may take such other
action as appropriate.
   (B)   Stop-work order; revocation or permit. In the event any person holding
an erosion control permit pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the
permit, or carries on site development in such a manner as to materially
adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of persons residing or working
in the neighborhood of the development site or so as to be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or improvements in
the neighborhood, the village may suspend or revoke the erosion control permit.
      (1)   Suspension of a permit shall be by a written stop-work order issued
by the village and delivered to the permittee or his or her agent or the person
performing the work. The stop-work order shall be effective immediately, shall
state the specific violations cited, and shall state the conditions under which
work may be resumed. A stop-work order shall remain in effect until the next
regular scheduled meeting of the Board of Appeals at which the conditions of
division (B)(2) below can be met.
      (2)   (a)   No erosion control permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the Board of Appeals. Written notice of the
hearing shall be served on the permittee, either personally or by registered
mail and shall state:
            1.   The grounds for complaint or reason for suspension or
revocation, in clear and concise language; and
            2.   The time when and place where such hearing will be held.
         (b)   The notice shall be served on the permittee at least five days
prior to the date set for the hearing. At the hearing, the permittee shall be
given an opportunity to be heard and may call witnesses and present evidence on
his or her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Appeals shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
(Ord. 766, passed 10-20-2004)
§ 157.99 PENALTY.
   No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair or maintain any grading,
excavation or fill, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or in violation
of any terms of this chapter. Any person violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and each day during which
any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is committed, continued
or permitted shall constitute a separate offense. Upon conviction of any such
violation, that person, partnership or corporation shall be punished by a fine
of not more than $500 for each offense. In addition to any other penalty
authorized by this section, any person, partnership or corporation convicted of
violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be required to restore
the site to the condition existing prior to commission of the violation, or to
bear the expense of the restoration.

(Ord. 808, passed 4-19-2006)
§ 161.110 SITE DRAINAGE.
   (A)   The parcel drainage shall be designed to flow away from the top of the
foundation. Storm water being directed to the side yard of the parcel shall be
directed into a formed drainage swale, having a minimum slope of one percent
and a maximum slope of seven percent. In the event that conditions dictate that
some parts of the lot be higher than the structure foundation, the grading plan
must show specific drainage configurations for the parcel specifying that all
drainage is to be directed to flow away from the foundation in an acceptable
manner.
   (B)   Rear lot line swales shall be graded to a positive outlet or inlet
structure at a minimum flowline slope of 1.5% and shall have side slopes of
(horizontal to vertical) or less.
   (C)   Construction and work such as walkways, driveways, landscaping or any
structure shall be installed so that the construction of same will not
interfere with drainage. All sidewalks, driveways, patios and other flat work
shall be at an elevation relative to the foundation wall so that water will
drain away from the structure on all sides and off the lot in a manner which
will provide reasonable freedom from erosion and permanently pocketed surface
water.
   (D)   The flow from offsite tributary areas that are tributary to an
intermittent stream or overflow route that must pass through the parcel must be
identified on the grading plan and must be designed in such a way to adequately
convey the flow of all surface water for a 100-year storm frequency without
damage to adjoining structures.
   (E)   All overflow routes for the 100-year storm and for accumulated storm
water runoff from several lots or from offsite catchment areas must be clearly
designated on the grading plan with the total width of the flow route contained
within an easement for drainage purposes.
(Ord. 808, passed 4-19-2006)
§ 161.111 PRIVATE UTILITIES.

properties.
         (e)   In order to provide an appropriate landscape screening between
any public right-of-way and any industrial structure, the following landscape
standards shall be adhered to by all industrial developments in addition to the
landscape requirements incorporated in §
161.108 above: there shall be a continuous landscape connection, with no
parking areas or driveways, between any industrial structure and a public
street for at least a minimum of 30% of the sites frontage, with a depth equal
or greater than 30 feet.
         (f)   Security fences on industrial sites shall be screened with
natural vegetation and the use of barb-wire, razor wire or fencing slats shall
be prohibited.
      (3)   Multi-family residential uses. These standards are intended to
minimize the bulk and mass of multi-family units and to create distinctive
neighborhoods by avoiding monotonous design and giving mufti-family dwellings a
more residential character.
         (a)   Multi-family units shall contain the following minimum
requirements:
            1.   Town homes or attached units: town homes or attached units
shall contain a minimum of 50% of either face brick or stone on all four

recesses or bay windows having a depth of at least 3% of the length of the rear
facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the rear facade.
         (d)   Multi-family structures should incorporate front elevations that
are not dominated by garage doors and wherever possible, garage doorways should
be recessed into the multi-family structures or placed in the rear of multi-
family structures.
         (e)   To minimize the number of multi-family units facing residential
streets, multi-family structures whenever possible should be aligned along one
of the following urban design configurations: motor courts; courtyards; village
greens; or a public square.
         (f)   Multi-family structures should be arranged in such a manner as
to enclose and frame common spaces. These common spaces should include gardens,
courtyards, recreation and play areas. These common spaces should incorporate
at least three of the following features:

of a custom cover or natural vegetation.
   (B)   Landscape and land use buffers.
      (1)   General; purpose. The purpose of this section is to require the
appropriate buffering between incompatible land uses; protect and preserve the
aesthetic appeal and character of the surrounding neighborhood and to provide a
level of visual screening around permanent structures and parking facilities:
         (a)   Each plan required hereunder shall be drawn to scale and shall
be fully dimensionalized. All proposed structures and other improvements shall
be accurately depicted thereon, including but not by the way of limitation, all
buildings, paved areas, berms, lights, retention and all detention areas and
landscaping. The plan shall specifically include the number, type, size and
location of all required vegetation and other landscape, which the applicant
proposes to preserve.
         (b)   All new site developments, expansion of existing structures or
reconstruction of structures shall conform to the following landscape
provisions:
            1.   Buffers. Landscape buffers shall be required for all
commercial, industrial and multi-family sites that abut single-family use
through the use of landscape berms, plantings and/or fencing to achieve no less
than 100% screening year-round. Any berm shall be a physical barrier that
blocks or screens the view similar to a hedge, fence or wall. Berms shall be
constructed with proper and adequate plant material to prevent erosion; and
            2.   Landscape standards. The following requirements shall apply to
all commercial, institutional, industrial and multi-family development and are
cumulative.
      (2)   Commercial, office and multi-family. The applicant shall provide a
minimum of one approved planting for each 500 square feet of gross lot area. No
more than 75% of the approved planting can be a combination of shrubs or ground
cover.
      (3)   Industrial. The applicant shall provide a minimum of one approved
planting for each 500 square feet of gross lot area.
         (a)   All required setback areas and areas of a site not proposed to
be improved with structures, paved areas, walks or other approved landscaping
shall be planted in grass sod or seed unless otherwise approved by the Board.
         (b)   All parking lot areas shall be screened from view of adjacent
properties and streets by
plantings that will attain a minimum height of three feet within three years or
provide for a three-foot undulating berm or low wall/fence.
         (c)   Commercial and office developments shall incorporate required
landscape islands that will correspond to an area of one parking space for
every seven actual parking spaces exclusive of required buffer yard and
foundation planting areas.
         (d)   Any required landscape islands shall be planted with two and
one-half-inch caliper canopy tree equivalents with preferred plantings mix
including one canopy tree. Each canopy tree shall be provided with at least 300
square feet of previous ground area for root growth. This dimension shall be
measured from the insides of the curbs.
         (e)   Commercial, office and industrial development shall provide
foundation plantings along any facade that exceeds 50 lineal feet.
Additionally, commercial, office and industrial developments shall provide a
minimum of one three-inch caliper canopy tree equivalent per 50 lineal feet of
building facade.
         (f)   Approved plantings and ground cover: the following shall
constitute approved planting and ground covers for inclusion in landscape plan
required hereunder.
            1.   Shade trees. Shade trees shall be permitted and shall not be
less than two and one-half-inch caliper measured one foot from the ground nor
less than six feet in height. The following trees are prohibited: soft maple,
poplar, box elder, catalpa, tree of heaven and mountain ash, as consistent with
the village subdivision regulations. Willow and mulberry trees may be used as
decorative plantings located so as to avoid shedding materials onto walks,
drives and parking areas.
            2.   Conifers. Conifers shall be permitted and shall not be any
less than six feet in height.
            3.   Ornamental trees. Ornamental trees shall be permitted and
shall not be less than two-inch in caliper measured one foot from the ground
nor less than six feet in height.
            4.   Living ground coverage. Living ground coverage shall be
provided at a density sufficient to guarantee total coverage within two years
of the date of the initial plantings.
         (g)   Minimum size of plantings: the minimum size of material at the
time of plantings shall be as follows:
            1.   Canopy tree at two and one-half-inch caliper: caliper shall be
measured 12 inches from the base of the tree;
            2.   Evergreen trees shall be minimum height of six feet; and
            3.   Deciduous or evergreen shrubs at 18 inches in height.
         (h)   Planting material variety: in order to allow flexibility while
maintaining minimum planting levels, provisions have been incorporated for
“canopy equivalents”, instead of canopy trees. A canopy equivalent is one
canopy tree, or three evergreen/understory/multi-stemmed trees, or 20 shrubs.
These equivalent amounts are allowed to substitute for a canopy tree since the
approximate coverage area at maturity of each of the equivalent amounts is
comparable to the approximate coverage area at maturity of one canopy tree.
         (i)   Replacements: subsequent to the review of the landscape plan,
and issuance of the building permit, the village may allow through a staff
review of the plan, minor deviations which do not substantially alter the plan,
and which do not substantially diminish the intended benefits of the plan.
   (C)   Trash enclosures and storage area screening.
      (1)   Enclosures surrounding trash receptacles shall be required to
provide a 100% visual screen. The enclosures shall be constructed of the
principle material as that used on the principle structure.

feet above grade and may be accomplished by berming, landscaping, neutral color
fence or masonry wall construction.
   (D)   Parking and drive areas.
      (1)   Parking improvements standards: all off-street parking and drive
areas shall be graded and paved or otherwise improved with Bituminous concrete
or Portland Cement concrete or other “dust free” paving materials as approved
by the Village Board.
      (2)   Parking stalls shall be identified by painting striping. Dimensions
for stall and drive aisles shall be in accordance with
Appendix B below. Disabled parking is required in accordance with local, state
and federal laws.
   (E)   Access. Vehicular ingress and egress points (curb cuts) to/from site
shall be no less than 50 feet from any street intersection (as measured from
the property corner to the nearest side of the curb cut) nor closer than 75
feet to another curb cut on the same street. Curb cut widths shall be no less
than 20 feet nor more than 40 feet in width. No more than two curb cuts per
site shall be permitted.
   (F)   Drainage/storm water controls. All sites shall be graded as to prevent
storm water run-off from impervious surfaced areas onto adjacent properties.
The storm water detention requirements specified in the Storm Water Drainage
and Detention Ordinance shall be applied. A combination of detention storage
and controlled release of storm water run-off shall be required for the
following.
      (1)   All sites involving improvements with a net developed area of two
acres or more.
      (2)   All sites involving improvements which have and will have
impervious areas of 50% of gross lot area or greater.
      (3)   In cases where improvements will be made to facilities existing
prior to the date of this chapter, the percent imperviousness will be based on
the entire parcel. If this percentage is 50% or greater, the storm water
detention requirement shall be applied only to the portion of the parcel being
improved.
   (G)   Lighting.
      (1)   All exterior lighting, except as hereby allowed, shall be fully
shielded, directed down at a 90-degree angle, and otherwise designed so as to
avoid glare onto neighboring residential properties. SHIELDED means that all
bulb/light source and cover portion of a fixture that transmits light shall not
extend beyond/below the opaque portion of the fixture so the bulb/light source
is not visible from general side view.
      (2)   All exterior lighting should balance the need of energy
conservation with the needs of safety, security and decoration.
      (3)   All exterior lighting shall be part of the site plan review process
and all lighting fixtures, standards and all exposed accessories shall be
concealed or harmonious with other project design materials. Subject to the
approval of staff, exterior decorative lighting shall be allowed in lieu of
exterior lighting standards and fixtures.
      (4)   In general, the height of exterior lighting features shall not
exceed the predominant height of principle building to which they relate.
      (5)   Exterior lighting shall not be designed to permit adverse effects
upon neighboring properties. Lighting designers shall identify the light cutoff
angle for all sources of outdoor illumination.
      (6)   As part of the site plan review, a photometric plan shall be
submitted for staff’s review. Commercial, office and industrial sites shall
incorporate a minimum of a “0.05" of a foot-candle at the property line.
      (7)   Security wall-pack lighting on exteriors of structures that point
down at a 45-degree shall be prohibited.

providing relief from the rigid requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Authorized variations. Variations may only be considered and granted
upon findings in compliance with this chapter and shall be limited to the
following instances and in no others:
      (1)   To permit a yard smaller than the yard required by the applicable
regulations;
      (2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots where the use otherwise would be
prohibited solely because of insufficient area of the lot or insufficient
average lot width. Provided however, no variation shall be granted if the area
of the lot is less than 90% of the required lot area;
      (3)   In the R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5 and R-6 districts, to reduce the off-

consistent with the provisions of this chapter;
      (8)   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming structure which has
been destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, or an act of God or the
public enemy, to the extent that the cost of the restoration to the condition
in which it was before the occurrence shall exceed 50% of the cost of
construction of the entire building new, where the Board shall find that a
continuation of the nonconforming use will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding area or in any other respect impair the public health, safety,
comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the village;
      (9)   To authorize the substitution of a nonconforming use in a
nonconforming structure (all or substantially all of which structure is
designed or intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is
located) where the new use is, or was, permitted in the same district or a more
restricted district, as the nonconforming use which presently occupies the
structure, but no such substitution or structural alteration shall be made
unless the change or structural alteration and the use thereof conforms to all
the regulations of the district in which the structure is located;
      (10)   To grant variations from the regulations herein contained for
building setbacks and height regulations and the requirements of steep slope
regulations, provided, however, that with respect to special setbacks such as
steep slope regulations, in addition to the general standards for variations
described in this division (B), the variance request meets the following
additional conditions:
         (a)   The applicant shall demonstrate that geotechnical
characteristics, hydrological controls and plans for vegetation will comport
with the regulations contained herein for required plans and development
standards; and
         (b)   The proposed development is a single-family residence or
involves enhancement of a lot upon which a single-family residence exists.

requirements have been satisfied as required under this chapter.
   (C)   Standing. A request for a variation from this chapter may be made by a
property owner, a contract purchaser, or anyone having a proprietary interest
in the subject property. All requests made by parties other than the property
owner must be accompanied by written authorization from the property owner.
   (D)   Standards for variations. The Plan Commission shall recommend the
granting of a variation when and only when it has determined from evidence
presented to them and placed on the record, that all the following standards
have been met:
      (1)   The requested variation does not permit a use otherwise excluded
from that particular zoning district;
      (2)   The relief sought cannot be accomplished except by the granting of
the requested variation and that the variation is the minimum relief necessary
to accomplish the relief sought;
      (3)   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light
or air to any other properties or uses, nor will it substantially increase the
potential spread of fire or in any way endanger the public health or safety;
      (4)   The proposed variation will not adversely impact the value of other
properties in the vicinity, nor will the granting of the variation adversely
impact upon the ability of surrounding properties to be used and enjoyed for
the purposes for which they have been planned and zoned, nor will it endanger
the public health or safety; and
      (5)   Adequate evidence was presented to establish an undue hardship so
that a variance should be permitted because of evidence of the following
conditions:
         (a)   Strict enforcement of the code would involve practical
difficulties or impose exceptional hardship;
         (b)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in
the particular zoning district;
         (c)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; and
         (d)   The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
   (E)   Conditions of variations. The Plan Commission may recommend and the
Village Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon the subject
property as may be necessary to guarantee that the implementation of the
variation will further the standards set forth in this chapter.
   (F)   Expiration. A variation which is not utilized within 12 months of
approval by the President and Board of Trustees shall expire unless extended by
the President and Board of Trustees for an additional period not to exceed 12
months.

§ 162.023 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   In order to accomplish the general purpose and intent of this chapter,
certain uses in each zoning district are classified as special uses.
   (B)   Because of their unique characteristics, these uses often require
larger land areas or need specific regulations to achieve compatibility with
existing development.
   (C)   The effects of these uses cannot normally be foreseen until a specific
site is proposed.
   (D)   These uses then must be given careful consideration relative to the
existing and proposed development in the area.
      (1)   Standing. Application for a special use may be made by the village,
the owner of the subject property or anyone having proprietary interest in the
subject property. All requests made by parties other than the property owner
must be accompanied by written authorization from the property owner.
      (2)   Standards. A special use other than a planned unit development
shall be authorized only when the Plan Commission shall find all of the
following.
         (a)   Compatible with existing development. The nature and intensity
of the activities involved and the size and placement of any structures
proposed will be so planned that the special use will be compatible with the
existing development and will not impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of surrounding property.
         (b)   Lot of sufficient size. The size of the lot will be sufficient
for the use proposed.
         (c)   Traffic. The location of the special use within the village will
be such that adverse effects on surrounding properties will be minimal,
particularly regarding the traffic generated by the special use.
         (d)   Parking and access. Parking areas will be of adequate size for
the particular use and properly located, and the entrance and exit drives will
be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.
         (e)   Effect on neighborhood. In all respects, the special use will
not be significantly or materially detrimental to the health, safety and
welfare of the public or injurious to the other property or improvements in the
neighborhood, nor will it diminish or impair property values in the surrounding
area.
         (f)   Adequate facilities. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage
and/or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided.
         (g)   Adequate buffering. Adequate fencing and/or screening shall be
provided to ensure the enjoyment of surrounding properties, to provide for the
public safety or to screen parking areas and other visually incompatible uses.
      (3)   Standard. The Plan Commission recommendation shall be consistent
with the objectives and intent of this chapter and shall refer to specific
zoning district standards as a guide to the establishment of requirements for
each special use.
      (4)   Conditions. The Plan Commission shall recommend such conditions or
restrictions upon the location, construction, design and operation of a special
use as they shall find necessary and appropriate to assure compliance with the
requirements set forth in this chapter and the objectives and intent of this
chapter. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, regulations
regarding landscaping, signage, adequate drainage of storm water, exterior
lighting, fence height and the duration of the special use.
      (5)   Effect of denial of a special use. No application for a special use
which has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of Trustees shall be re-
submitted for a period of one year from the date of the decision, except on the
grounds of new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the
Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees.
      (6)   Time limits. A special use shall become null and void if not
established or actively pursued within one year of the date of approval except
for a planned unit development as provided in §§
162.110 through
162.122 below.

   (H)   Application for a special use permit for antenna facilities. In
addition to the requirements of §
162.023, the applicant shall be required to submit information that includes,
but is not necessarily limited to, how the proposed special use will satisfy
the following conditions.
      (1)   Points of visual interest shall be protected. Views from
residential structures located within 250 feet of the proposed antenna or tower
to the following points of interest shall be protected to the greatest
practical extent:
         (a)   Public open spaces;
         (b)   Natural areas; and
         (c)   Landmark structures.
      (2)   Methods for protecting points of visual interest. The following
standards shall be used to protect the above identified points of visual
interest to the greatest practical extent if views from a residential structure
located within 250 feet from a proposed antenna or tower to a point of visual
interest specifically identified above, are significantly impacted. The
applicant shall:
         (a)   Examine locations within the same area where the visual impacts
can be minimized;
         (b)   Investigate alternative tower designs that can be used to
minimize the interruptions of views from the residence to the point of visual
interest;
         (c)   Minimize visual impacts to the point of visual interest referred
to above, by demonstrating that coloration or the use of other structures
within the service area is not feasible at this time; and
         (d)   Minimize visual impacts varying the setbacks or landscape
standards that would otherwise be applicable, so long as the overall impact of
the proposed development is as good or better than that which would otherwise
be required without the variations.
      (3)   Color. Antennas or towers and their supporting structures shall be
a neutral color that is the same or similar in color as the supporting
structure to make the antenna and equipment as visually unobtrusive as
possible, unless otherwise specified under Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) standards.
      (4)   Height. Antennas or towers shall not exceed the maximum building
height plus 15 feet, in the zoning district in which it is located, applicants
who wish to exceed this height shall provide evidence demonstrating the need
for exceeding this minimum standard.
      (5)   Setbacks (adjacent to residential uses). Antennas or towers shall
be set back from any existing adjacent residential property line by a distance
equal to the height of the tower, unless building plans are submitted
demonstrating that the tower will collapse within itself. The building plans
shall be affixed with the seal of a certified structural engineer.
      (6)   Lighting. None allowed except as required by the FAA.
      (7)   Fencing and security. For security, antennas or towers and
ancillary facilities shall be enclosed by a fence not less than six feet in
height.
      (8)   Landscaping and screening. Landscaping shall be placed outside the
required fence area on sides facing public rights-of-way or residential areas
and shall consist of a fast growing vegetation with a minimum planted height of
four feet, spaced evenly at intervals equal to twice the expected width of the
plant material.
      (9)   Noise. Noise generating equipment shall be sound buffered by means
of baffling, barriers, or other suitable means to reduce sound level measured
at the property line of 30 dBA when adjacent to residential areas and 45 dBA in
other areas.
      (10)   Tower design. Towers shall generally be designed without the use
of guy wires or external supports. In instances where such a requirement may
not be feasible, appropriate documentation shall be provided by the petitioner,
demonstrating why such a tower is not feasible. The applicant will offer
alternatives to the design so as to minimize the visual impact of the tower.
      (11)   Coloration protocol. Any special use request for the erection of a
new tower shall complete the coloration protocol as outlined in division (I)
below.
   (I)   Coloration protocol.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this requirement is to create a process
that will allow providers to equitably share publicly available, nonproprietary
information among themselves, with interested persons and agencies, and with
the village, at the time the provider schedules a pre-application conference
with the village. This coloration protocol is designed to increase the
likelihood that all reasonable opportunities for coloration have been
investigated and that the appropriate information has been shared among the
providers. The village recognizes that coloration is preferable, where
technologically feasible and visually desirable, as a matter of public policy,
but that coloration of antennas by providers is not always feasible for
technical or business reasons. However, if all licensed providers are made
aware of any pending tower of antenna permit request, the disclosure will allow
providers to have the maximum amount of time to consider possible coloration
opportunities, and will also assure the village that all reasonable
accommodations for coloration have been investigated.
      (2)   Pre-application requirement. A pre-application conference is
required for all proposed support structures.
      (3)   Coloration request letter requirement. At the time of pre-
application conference, the applicant shall demonstrate that the following
notice was mailed to all other providers rendering service within the village:
         “Pursuant to the requirements of § 162.097 of the Village of Elwood
Zoning Code, (applicant) is hereby providing you with notice of our intent to
meet with the Village of Elwood in a pre-application conference to discuss the
location of a wireless communication facility that would be located at
______________________. In general, we plan to construct a support structure of
__________ feet in height for the purpose of providing (Cellular, PCS, etc.)
service.
         Please inform us whether you have any existing or pending antenna or
tower facilities located within _________ feet of the proposed facility that
may be available for possible coloration opportunities. Please provide us with
this information within ten business days after the date of this letter. Your
cooperation is appreciated.”
      (4)   Applicant’s duty to analyze the feasibility of coloration. If a
response to coloration request letter is received by an applicant indicating an
opportunity for coloration, the applicant shall analyze the feasibility of
coloration. This analysis shall be submitted with an application for any
support structure. The investigation of the feasibility of coloration shall be
deemed to have occurred if the applicant submits all of the following
information:
         (a)   A statement from a qualified engineer indicating whether the
necessary service can or cannot be provided by coloration at the possible
location site;
         (b)   Evidence that the lessor of the possible coloration site either
agrees or disagrees to coloration on their property;
         (c)   Evidence that adequate access does or does not exist at the
possible collocation site to accommodate needed equipment and meet all of the
site development standards; and
         (d)   Evidence that adequate access does or does not exist at the
possible collocation site.
      (5)   Result of coloration feasibility analysis. If the applicant has
provided information addressing each of the criteria in division (D) above, the
coloration protocol shall be deemed complete.
   (J)   Abandoned facilities. An antenna or satellite dish whose use has been
discontinued for a period of six consecutive months or longer is hereby
declared abandoned. Abandoned facilities shall be removed by the property owner
within 90 days of abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned facility is
declared a public nuisance and is subject to penalties as outlined in the
Elwood Municipal Code.

PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
§ 162.110 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose and intent of planned unit developments are to provide for
certain exceptions to the use and bulk regulations of this code, where those
exceptions will be utilized to provide greater flexibility and originality in
the design of projects than might otherwise be possible under conventional
zoning.
   (B)   A planned unit development is intended to permit and encourage
flexibility and to accomplish the following goals:
      (1)   To stimulate unique and creative approaches to the development of
land;
      (2)   To provide for the more efficient use of land;
      (3)   To promote flexibility in design and permit planned diversification
in the location of structures;
      (4)   To promote an efficient use of land to facilitate sustainability in
the arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, utilities, open space and
natural resources;
      (5)   To preserve existing natural resources and landscape features and
to utilize them in a manner harmonious with the development;
      (6)   To provide for more usable and suitably located recreation
facilities and other public facilities than would otherwise be provided under
conventional development;
      (7)   To provide for the aesthetic and functional harmony of various
types of buildings, land uses and landscape elements;
      (8)   To develop new approaches to the living environment through variety
in type, design and layout of residential structures, commercial and industrial
buildings, transportation systems and public facilities;
      (9)   To allow for the development of properties with unique constraints
such as environmentally-sensitive areas or infill parcels which require a more
flexible approach to land use control to make possible development that is
sensitive to the constraints; and
      (10)   A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort,
morals and welfare.
   (C)   The planned unit development is intended to provide for developments
incorporating a single type or a variety of related uses which are planned and
developed as a unit. The planned unit development may provide amenities not
otherwise required by law and should establish facilities and open space
greater than the minimums required by law.
   (D)   The development may consist of conventional subdivided lots or provide
for development by a planned unit development plat which establishes the
location and extent of the features of the planned unit development in keeping
with the purpose of the plan.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-2-2001)
§ 162.111 STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS.
   A planned unit development shall be granted as a special use. Even though
specified as a special use, a planned unit development is substantially
different from other special uses. To reflect this difference, additional
regulations and standards are hereby established. The planned unit development
shall conform to the intent, purpose and character of the zoning district in
which it is located.

§ 162.117 DESIGN INCENTIVES.
   (A)   Design incentives are contingent upon the provision of amenities,
landscaping, open space, and architectural design requirements. These must be
provided to counter any concerns over the effects of the incentives.
   (B)   Examples of these are listed below.
      (1)   Amenities. Amenities may include gazebos, bike trails, tennis
courts, swimming pools, recreational centers or areas or any number of
improvements to the community’s quality of life and leisure.
      (2)   Landscaping. Landscaping increases the visual aesthetics and
natural habitat of a community as well as providing an environmentally
sustainable development. Landscaping can include trees, shrubs and grasses for
aesthetics as well as providing a reduction in storm water run off and erosion.
      (3)   Open space.
         (a)   Open space can be provided in many ways.
         (b)   Conservation areas, recreational areas, wildlife habitats, lakes
and ponds, and trails are all examples of how open space can increase the
economic, social and environmental qualities of a development without
compromising other values of the development from additional design incentives.
      (4)   Architectural design. Excellence in architectural design may
include developing buildings with varying styles, facades, materials, roof
lines and the like. Anti-monotony is an essential variable in community
development along with landscaping and other design requirements.
   (B)   To further creativity and excellence in design, the following
incentives are offered in planned unit developments.
      (1)   Varied zoning requirements. Bulk requirements of the underlying
zoning district(s) may be varied provided that it can be demonstrated that the
variations conform to all of the review criteria contained herein as well as
those established for special uses and those established for subdivision plats.
      (2)   Varied subdivision requirements. Dimensional and design standards
for subdivisions and subdivision improvements such as streets, blocks,
sidewalks and parkways may vary from village standards established or
referenced in the village subdivision regulations provided that it can be
demonstrated that the variations conform to all of the review criteria
contained herein as well as those established for special uses and those
established for subdivision plats. Required subdivision improvements may not
vary from the required construction improvement specifications.
      (3)   Mixed uses. A PUD may include a variety of land uses designed and
planned as part of a unified development provided that the underlying zoning
conforms to the uses being proposed.
      (4)   Onsite density transfer. The density permitted in a given portion
of a total site may be transferred to another portion of site in order to
preserve environmentally sensitive areas or to achieve excellence in design
provided that the gross density does not exceed the maximum allowed herein for
the underlying zoning district.
      (5)   Density bonuses. Design excellence in the provision of site
amenities such as exceptional landscaping, recreational facilities,
preservation of architectural and historic sites, and the preservation of
environmentally sensitive areas may allow the granting of an increase in
density of up to 15%.
   (C)   The gross maximum density of a residential PUD shall not exceed the
following standard for the district in which it is situated:
GR  2 du/acre
R1  2.5 du/acre
R2  3 du/acre for single-family detached 6.0 du/acre for two-family
R2A 3 du/acre
R3  3 du/acre for single-family detached
    5 du/acre for two-family

    6 du/acre for single-family attached
    12 du/acre for multi-family
 
   (D)   Flexibility to suspend requirements imposed by the village’s zoning
and subdivision regulations is not conferred upon the PUD applicant as a matter
of right but in all cases subject to the finding by the village that the
objectives of these provisions are being served by the PUD and that all
applicable review standards are being adhered to. Variations in a PUD from
normally applicable standards shall not be considered as variances as defined

conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
            3.   The village shall document the basis for a denial, including
the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is
based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
village denies an application.
            4.   The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice
of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application
fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days
after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure
to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the
application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the village's review period.
            5.   The applicant must notify the village in writing of its
intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis,
which may be submitted with the revised application.
            6.   Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the

the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each
involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and
substantially the same type of structure.
         (b)   If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities,
the village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the
application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which
incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for
consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate
permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of permits. 
         (a)   The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than
five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the
village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or

wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
         (d)   The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility
based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with
the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
         (a)   However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless
provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
         (b)   For purposes of this division, the terms COMMUNICATIONS SPACE,
COMMUNICATION WORKER SAFETY ZONE, and ELECTRIC SUPPLY ZONE have the meanings
given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.

         (a)   Except as provided in this collocation requirements and
conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose
that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village,
the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property
rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does
not satisfy the criteria in this division.

on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
            1.   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way
within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures
shall control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   Forty-five feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant

not prohibit the replacement of utility poles.
      (13)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:

      (2)   The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the
wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days
of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      (3)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if
it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the
village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new
wireless provider.
(Ord. 1095, passed 7-11-2018)
§ 164.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Will County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
village shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than $200 per year per municipal utility pole, with rates to
be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 1095, passed 7-11-2018)
§ 164.05 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord. 1095, passed 7-11-2018)
§ 164.06 INSURANCE.
   The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   (A)   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
   (B)   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
   (C)   (1)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with its requirements of other users of village
improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage.
      (2)   The wireless provider shall include the village as an additional
insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification
and documentation of inclusion of the village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
      (3)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirement required by the village. A wireless
provider that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the name of additional insureds
under this section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall
provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability
to self-insure the insurance coverage limits required by the village.
