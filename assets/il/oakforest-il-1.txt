      (3)   Subsidiary motions.
         (a)   The following motions are undebatable:
            1.   Lay on the table;
            2.   The previous question (close debate) (requires a two-thirds
majority vote); and

         (c)   Reconsider (debatable); and
         (d)   Ratify (debatable).
      (5)   Motion to refer. A motion to refer to a standing committee shall
take precedence over a similar motion to refer to a special committee.
      (6)   Motion to amend.
         (a)   A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to
amend an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained.
         (b)   An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in
order, but an amendment relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
         (c)   On an amendment to “strike out and insert,” the paragraph to be
amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be
stricken out, then those to be inserted and finally the paragraph as it will
stand if so amended shall be read.
         (d)   An amendment to the main question or another pending question
may be referred to a committee, and neither the main question nor such other
pending question shall be affected thereby.
      (7)   Filling of blanks. When a blank is to be filled, and different sums
or times are proposed, the question shall be taken first on the last sum or the
longest time.
      (8)   Motion to substitute. A substitute for any original proposition
under debate or for any pending amendment to the proposition may be
entertained, notwithstanding that at such time further amendment is admissible,
and if accepted by Council by vote, shall entirely supersede the original
proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all amendments
appertaining thereto.
      (9)   Reconsideration.
         (a)   A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the
same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A motion for
reconsideration, once having been made and decided in the negative, shall not
be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered. No motion to
reconsider the approval or denial of the recommendation of an advisory body
required to hold public hearings shall be entertained, except at the same
meeting at which the original action was taken or after the matter has been
referred to the advisory body for a further hearing and recommendation.
         (b)   A motion to reconsider must be made and seconded by members who
voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered, unless
otherwise provided by law. However, where a motion has received a majority vote
in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground that a greater
number of affirmative votes is required by statute for the passage or adoption
of the motion, then in such case a motion to reconsider may be made and
seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on the question to be
reconsidered, so long as the issue presented is the same, no new information is
forthcoming and the rights of third parties have not intervened.

§ 31.014 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (A)   Intent; sexual harassment defined; findings.
      (1)   The city is committed to maintaining a work environment that
encourages and fosters appropriate conduct among employees and respect for
individual values and sensibilities. Accordingly, the city intends to enforce
this sexual harassment policy at all levels within the work place in order to
create an environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual
harassment.
      (2)   Sexual harassment, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and the State Department of Human Rights, and for the purposes of
this policy, consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors
or other verbal, nonverbal or physical acts of a sexual or sex-based nature,
where:
         (a)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;
         (b)   An employment decision affecting an employee is based on that
individual’s acceptance or rejection of the conduct; or
         (c)   The conduct interferes with an individual’s work performance or
creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
      (3)   Sexual harassment can occur between men and women or members of the
same gender. This behavior is unacceptable in the work place itself and in
other work-related settings, such as business trips, court appearances and
business-related social events.
      (4)   Sexual harassment affects the victim and other employees as well.
Each incident of harassment contributes to a general atmosphere in which
everyone suffers the consequences. Sexually-oriented acts or sex-based conduct
has no legitimate business purpose. Where the conduct is directed by a
supervisor (or someone in a management position) toward a subordinate, the
former will be held to a higher standard of accountability because of the
degree of control and influence he or she has or is perceived to have over the
employment conditions and benefits of the subordinate.
   (B)   Prohibited conduct.
      (1)   Prohibited acts of sexual harassment can take a variety of forms,
ranging from subtle pressure for sexual activity or contact to physical
contact. At times the offender may be unaware that his or her conduct is
offensive or harassing to others. Examples of conduct that could be considered
sexual harassment include:
         (a)   Persistent or repeated unwelcome flirting, pressure for dates,
sexual comments or touching;
         (b)   Sexually suggestive jokes, gestures or sounds directed toward
another, or sexually oriented or degrading comments about another;
         (c)   Preferential treatment of an employee, or a promise of
preferential treatment to an employee, in exchange for dates or sexual conduct,
or the denial or threat of denial of employment, benefits or advancement for
refusal to consent to sexual advances;
         (d)   The open display of sexually-oriented pictures, posters or other
material offensive to others; and
         (e)   Retaliation against an individual for reporting or complaining
about sexually harassing conduct.
      (2)   It is unlawful to retaliate in any way against anyone who has
complained about sexual harassment or discrimination, whether that concern
relates to the harassment of or discrimination against the individual raising
the concern or against another individual.
   (C)   Application of policy; reports. This policy covers all employees and
officers of the city. The city will not tolerate, condone or allow sexual
harassment, whether engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors, associates or
partners, or by outside clients or other nonemployees who conduct business with
the city. The city supports and encourages the reporting of all incidents of
sexual harassment, regardless of who the offender may be, and will promptly
investigate all reported incidents. Where the alleged offender is not an
employee or officer of the city, the city administration, in consultation with
the complainant, will review the complaint and make every effort to identify a
reasonable remedy if sexual harassment has been confirmed.
   (D)   Complaint process. Though the city encourages individuals who believe
that they are being harassed to firmly and promptly notify the offender that
his or her behavior is unwelcome, the city also recognizes that power and
status disparities between an alleged harasser and a target may make a
confrontation impossible. In the event that the informal, direct communication
between individuals is either ineffective or impossible, or even when the
communication has occurred, the following steps shall be taken to report a
sexual harassment complaint:
      (1)   Reporting of incidents. All employees are urged to report any
suspected sexual harassment to their department head, except if that person is
the individual accused of harassment. In that case, the complaint shall be
reported to the Mayor or an alderman. If the victim prefers to report the
suspected harassment to someone of the opposite gender from that of the
suspected harasser, the complaint can be reported to any other elected or
appointed individual in a position of authority. The report may be made
initially either orally or in writing, but reports made orally must be reduced
to writing before an investigation can be initiated and a resolution achieved.
      (2)   Investigation of complaints. When a complaint has been reduced to
writing, the individual informed pursuant to division (D)(1) above will
initiate an investigation of the suspected sexual harassment within five
working days of notification. The city representative receiving the complaint
shall designate another official or employee to assist him or her in the
investigation. If any of those individuals is the subject of the investigation,
the investigation will be conducted by the Mayor. The investigation will
include an interview with the employee who made the initial report, the person
towards whom the suspected harassment was directed and the individual accused
of the harassment. Any other person who may have information regarding the
alleged sexual harassment may also be interviewed.
      (3)   Reports. The person responsible for investigating the complaint
shall prepare a written report within ten working days of his or her
notification of the suspected harassment, unless extenuating circumstances
prevent him or her from doing so. The report shall include a finding that
sexual harassment occurred, that sexual harassment did not occur or that there
is inconclusive evidence as to whether or not sexual harassment occurred. A
copy of the report will be given to the employee who made the initial report,
the employee to whom the suspected harassment was directed and the individual
accused of the harassment.
      (4)   Records: confidentiality. Employees who report incidents of sexual
harassment are encouraged to keep written notes in order to accurately record
the offensive conduct. Every effort shall be made to keep all matters related
to the investigation and various reports confidential. In the event of a
lawsuit, however, the city advises that records that it maintains and that the
complainant maintains may not be considered privileged from disclosure. Written
records will be maintained for a period of time as required by the Local
Records Act.
      (5)   Time frame for reporting of complaints. The city encourages a
prompt reporting of complaints so that rapid response and appropriate action
may be taken. However, because of the sensitivity of these problems and because
of the emotional toll the misconduct may have on the individual, no limited
time frame will be instituted for reporting sexual harassment complaints.
Delayed reporting of complaints will not in and of itself preclude the city
from taking remedial action.
      (6)   Protection against retaliation. The city will not in any way
retaliate against an individual who makes a report of sexual harassment, nor
permit any officer or employee to do so. Retaliation is a serious violation of
this policy and shall be reported immediately. Any person found to have
retaliated against another individual for reporting sexual harassment will be
subject to the same disciplinary action provided for sexual harassment
offenders.
      (7)   Appeals. If a party directly involved in a sexual harassment
investigation is dissatisfied with the outcome or resolution, that individual
has the right to appeal the decision. The dissatisfied party shall submit his
or her written comments in a timely manner to Council.
   (E)   Disciplinary action.
      (1)   Disciplinary action will be taken against any employee found to
have engaged in the sexual harassment of any other employee. The extent of
sanctions may depend, in part, upon the length and conditions of employment of
the particular employee, the nature of the offense and the limitations of state
law and union contracts. The city has the right to apply any sanction or
combination of sanctions, up to and including termination, to deal with
unreasonable conduct or discrimination.
      (2)   Where a hostile work environment has been found to exist, the city
will take all reasonable steps to eliminate the conduct creating such an
environment. If an investigation results in a finding that the complainant
falsely accused another of sexual harassment, knowingly or in a malicious
manner, the complainant will be subject to appropriate sanctions, including the
possibility of termination.
   (F)   Policy not contractual; amendments. This policy is not intended as a
contractual obligation. The city reserves the right to amend the policy from
time to time.
(2000 Code, § 2.22.140)
§ 31.015 MAYOR AS LIQUOR CONTROL COMMISSIONER; REVIEW AND APPEAL.
   (A)   Unless and until otherwise provided by Council, the Mayor shall be the
Liquor Control Commissioner of and for the city.
   (B)   Effective upon the passage of the resolution codified in this section,
all reviews or appeals of the actions or orders of the Liquor Control
Commissioner shall be made by the Illinois Liquor Control Commission on the
official record made before the Liquor Control Commissioner, as provided by
law.
(2000 Code, § 2.22.150)
§ 31.016 MAYORAL AUTHORITY TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY.
   (A)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to render a declaration of a state of
emergency within the City of Oak Forest based on the following findings and
supporting facts:
      (1)   That any type of emergency, natural disaster or catastrophe which
will likely cause damage, injury, losses, hardship or suffering to the
community or its residents, which can be construed broadly to include disease
epidemics and other public health emergencies, is imminent or has occurred.
      (2)   That the emergency is severe enough to require the declaration of
emergency in order to supplement local resources in preventing loss of life or
injury, alleviating damages, loss, hardship or suffering or to necessitate
measures to be taken, including the identification of any applicable
procedures, rules or regulations that will be waived or suspended, during the
emergency.
   (B)   The exercise of these powers shall be based upon a statement, signed
under oath by the Mayor, finding that the standards herein which form the basis
for such a declaration have been met, along with those facts which substantiate
such a finding and declaring that a state of emergency exists.
   (C)   This written declaration shall be filed with the Clerk of the
municipality as soon as practicable.
   (D)   Any state of emergency declared pursuant to this authority shall
expire no later than the adjournment of the first regular meeting of the
corporate authorities after the state of emergency has been declared.
   (E)   A declaration of emergency pursuant to this authority may not suspend
in any way the rights of residents of the City of Oak Forest under the Illinois
or United States Constitutions.

(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
§ 32.004 CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT; ESTABLISHMENT; JURISDICTION.
   There is hereby created within the City of Oak Forest a Code Hearing
Department, which is authorized to provide for and operate a system of
administrative adjudication, as more fully described herein, which shall have
jurisdiction over the adjudication and enforcement of any violation of the city
code.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
§ 32.005 CODE HEARING DEPARTMENT; ORGANIZATION.
   The Code Hearing Department shall be comprised of a Hearing Officer, an
Adjudication Hearing Administrator, the Chief of Police, or his or her
designee, and any other duly appointed person or persons deemed necessary for
the efficient administration of the Code Hearing Department, with the following
powers and authority.
   (A)   Hearing Officer. All adjudicatory hearings shall be presided over by a
Hearing Officer. Prior to conducting administrative adjudication hearings, the

which includes the following:
      (1)   Instruction on the rules of procedure of the administrative
adjudication hearings that they will conduct and preside over;
      (2)   Orientation to each subject area of the code for which they may
adjudicate a violation;
      (3)   Observation of administrative adjudication hearings;
      (4)   Participation in hypothetical cases, including ruling on evidence
and issuing final orders; and
      (5)   In addition, a Hearing Officer must be an attorney licensed to

Officer may not be an inspector or law enforcement officer employed by the
city. Hearing Officers are hereby authorized, empowered and directed to:
         (a)   Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the
existence of an ordinance violation;
         (b)   Issue subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give relevant
testimony or tangible items at an administrative adjudication hearing, upon the

         (c)   Preserve and authenticate the record of the administrative
adjudication hearings, including all exhibits and evidence introduced at the
hearing;
         (d)   Issue a determination, based on the evidence presented at the
administrative adjudication hearing, of whether a code violation occurred or
exists. The Hearing Officer’s determination shall be in writing and shall
include written findings of fact and law, a decision, and an order including
the fine, penalty or other action with which the respondent must comply; and
         (e)   Impose penalties consistent with the applicable code and assess
costs upon finding a party liable for the alleged violation, except, however,
that in no event shall the Hearing Officer have authority to impose a penalty
of incarceration, or impose a fine in excess of $50,000. The maximum monetary
fine under this division (A)(5)(e) shall be exclusive of costs of enforcement
or costs incurred by the city to secure compliance with the code and shall not
be applicable to cases to enforce the collection of any tax imposed and
collected by the city.
   (B)   Adjudication Hearing Administrator. The Adjudication Hearing
Administrator shall either be an employee of the City of Oak Forest appointed
by the Police Chief with the consent of the City Administrator, an independent
contractor or agency contracted by the city to perform such duties as
enumerated herein. The Adjudication Hearing Administrator is hereby authorized,
empowered and directed to:
      (1)   Operate and manage the system of administrative adjudication of all
code violations as may be permitted by law and directed by ordinance;
      (2)   Adopt, distribute and process all notices as may be required under
this subchapter or as may reasonably be required to carry out the purpose of
this subchapter;
      (3)   Collect moneys paid as fines and/or penalties assessed after a
final determination of liability;
      (4)   Certify copies of final determinations of all code violations
adjudicated pursuant to this subchapter, and any factual reports verifying the
final determination of any violation liability which were issued in accordance
with this subchapter or the laws of the State of Illinois, including ILCS Ch.
625, Act5, § 11-208.3, as from time to time amended;
      (5)   Certify reports to the Secretary of State concerning initiation of
suspension of driving privileges in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter and those of the laws of the State of Illinois;
      (6)   Promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary for the
efficient operation and maintenance of the system of administrative
adjudication hereby established; and
      (7)   Collect unpaid fines and penalties either directly or through
private collection agencies that may be retained by the city or by requesting
the City Prosecutor to act on behalf of the city in filing complaints in the
Cook County Circuit Court, seeking judgments for unpaid fines or penalties and
pursuing all post-judgment remedies available under current law.
   (C)   Automation. The Adjudication Hearing Administrator is hereby further
authorized, empowered and directed to operate and maintain a computer program
for the system of administrative adjudication hereby established, on a day-to-
day basis, including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Inputting of violation notice information;
      (2)   Establishing hearing dates and notice dates;
      (3)   Recording fine and penalty assessment and payments;
      (4)   Issuing payment receipts;
      (5)   Issuing succeeding notice of hearing dates and/or final
determinations of liability, issuing notices of impending immobilization,
issuing notices of impending impoundment, and issuing notices of impending
driver’s license suspension as may be required, in accordance with the Illinois
Vehicle Code. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the Adjudication
Hearing Administrator from including one or more of the above notices in the
same notice report; and
      (6)   Keeping accurate records of appearances and non-appearances at
administrative adjudication hearing, pleas entered and fines and other
penalties assessed and paid.
   (D)   Police personnel. The Chief of Police shall appoint and/or designate a
police officer to provide security for the administrative adjudication
hearings, and the officers are hereby authorized and directed to:
      (1)   Maintain hearing room decorum;
      (2)   Execute authority as granted to courtroom deputies of the Circuit
Court; and
      (3)   Perform other duties or acts as may be reasonably required and as
directed by the Hearing Officer or the Adjudication Hearing Administrator.

(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
HEARINGS
§ 32.020 COMMENCEMENT OF HEARINGS.
   (A)   (1)   A proceeding before a Hearing Officer shall be instituted upon
the filing with the Adjudication Hearing Administrator of a written sworn
pleading, complaint or citation by any authorized official of the city,
including police officers, code enforcement officers, and such other employees
as authorized.
      (2)   In the event a complaint causing the initiation of a hearing is
filed by a tenant or occupant of a dwelling who is not also the owner thereof,
no action for eviction, abatement of a nuisance, forcible entry and detainer or
other similar proceeding, whether it be civil or criminal, shall be threatened
or instituted against the tenant or occupant solely because the tenant or
occupant files the complaint or agrees to testify or present tangible evidence
at an administrative adjudication hearing. The foregoing sentence shall not
apply if the owner proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant or
occupant is the proximate cause of the violation for which the hearing is
commenced.
   (B)   Respondents shall be served with a copy of the written sworn pleading,
complaint or citation along with a notice of hearing in a manner reasonably
calculated to give them actual notice of the proceeding instituted against
them, by one or more of the following means:
      (1)   Personal service upon a party or its authorized agent;
      (2)   Service by certified mail, return receipt requested;
      (3)   Service by first class mail, postage prepaid; or
      (4)   If the applicable violation relates to the condition, operation or
location of a motor vehicle, by posting a copy of the sworn pleading, complaint
or citation in a conspicuous place upon the property or motor vehicle where the
violation is found.
      (5)   Any notice presented by first class or certified mail, or by
posting, shall be deemed served three days after the deposit of the notice in
the U.S. mail or the posting of the notice.
   (C)   Notices of hearing shall include:
      (1)   The type and nature of the ordinance violation to be adjudicated,
including a citation to the appropriate section of the code;
      (2)   The date and time of the administrative adjudication hearing;
      (3)   The legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to
be held;
      (4)   The applicable fines, late payment fees and penalties for failure
to appear at the hearing;
      (5)   Any witnesses or complainants who may be called to testify for the
city who are not employees or officers thereof; and
      (6)   An explanation that payment of the indicated fine, and of any
applicable penalty for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of
the violation.
   (D)   Administrative adjudication hearings shall be scheduled and docketed
by the Adjudication Hearing Administrator not less than 15 nor more than 30
days after the notice of hearing is served on the respondent.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
§ 32.021 HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity. Parties shall be provided with an opportunity for a
hearing before or during which they may exercise any or all of the following
rights:
      (1)   Be represented by counsel, although respondents shall not be
entitled to have an attorney appointed to represent them;
      (2)   Present and cross-examine witnesses; and
      (3)   Request the Hearing Officer to issue subpoenas to direct the
attendance and testimony of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant
tangible evidence.
   (B)   Rules of evidence shall not govern. The formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply in an administrative adjudication hearing authorized
under this subchapter. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it
is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct
of their affairs.
   (C)   Standard of proof. Administrative adjudication hearings are civil in
nature. The city shall bear the standard of proof to prove by a preponderance
of the evidence the occurrence or existence of a violation of the code. A
sworn, written pleading, complaint or citation, or a copy thereof, containing
information to support all the elements of the alleged violation shall
constitute prima facie evidence of the violation.
   (D)   Defenses. It shall be a defense to a code violation charged under this
subchapter if the owner, his or her attorney, or any other agent or
representative proves to the Hearing Officer’s satisfaction that:
      (1)   The code violation alleged in the notice did not in fact exist at
the time of the citation, pleading or complaint;
      (2)   The code violation has been caused by the current property
occupants and that in spite of reasonable attempts by the owner to maintain the
dwelling free of the violations, the current occupants continue to cause the
violations; or
      (3)   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
owner or his or her agent to all or a part of the dwelling for the purpose of
correcting the code violation(s).
      (4)   The code violation alleged in the notice occurred when the
respondent was not the owner or lessee of the subject real or personal
property. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any existing order to correct
a code violation and/or sanctions imposed by the city as a result of a finding
of a code violation under this subchapter shall attach to the property as well
as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a code violation against
one owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the property to
another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner of the property takes the
same subject to the findings, decision and order of a Hearing Officer under
this subchapter.
   (E)   Continuances. No continuances shall be authorized by a Hearing Officer
for any administrative adjudication hearing commenced under this subchapter
except in cases where a continuance is necessary to protect the rights of the
respondent or owner. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a
continuance. Any continuance authorized by a Hearing Officer shall not exceed
28 days.
   (F)   Judicial review. Any final decision by a Hearing Officer that a code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law, ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq., or as
hereinafter amended. Any person filing for judicial review under the
Administrative Review Law shall be subject to the assessment of costs for the
preparation and certification of the record of proceedings before the Hearing
Officer. The cost shall be assessed as $100 for the first page of the
transcript and $25 for each page thereafter. Any failure to pay the fee shall
subject the party seeking review to the provisions of ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, § 3-
109, including dismissal of the complaint on motion of the city.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
§ 32.022 NON-RESIDENT HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Persons who are not residents of the city may contest the merits of
the alleged violation without attending a hearing as provided in §
32.021 above by submitting a waiver of hearing and a notarized statement of
facts specifying grounds for challenging the notice of violation.
   (B)   The Hearing Officer shall issue to the Adjudication Hearing
Administrator a finding and order based on the citation and notarized statement
of facts.
   (C)   The Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall notify the respondent on
the Hearing Officer’s finding and order at the address provided by the non-
resident.
   (D)   In all other respects, the procedures and rules set forth in this
subchapter shall apply to non-residents.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
§ 32.023 ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENT; PENALTIES.
   (A)   The owner or responsible party charged with any violation of the code,
upon a finding of liability, shall be fined an amount set forth in the Fine
Schedule attached to Ord. 2007-03-00900, passed 3-27-2007 as Table A. For each
violation not expressly described in the Fine Schedule, the applicable penalty
set forth in the code shall apply, provided that where no specific penalty is
described the general penalty provisions of the code shall apply. Separate
fines shall be imposed against a person for each and every finding of liability
of each and every violation of the code.
   (B)   Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other
sanction or cost imposed, remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of or the
failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the Illinois Administrative
Review Law are a debt due and owing the City of Oak Forest and may be collected
in accordance with applicable law.
   (C)   Failure of the respondent to pay such fine or penalty after the
exhaustion of or the failure to exhaust judicial review procedures under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may result in, if applicable:
      (1)   The immobilization of the person’s vehicle for failure to pay fines
or penalties for five or more parking violations; and
      (2)   The suspension of the person’s driver’s license for failure to pay
fines or penalties for ten or more parking violations.
   (D)   After expiration of the period in which judicial review under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final determination of
an ordinance violation, unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
findings, decision and order of the Hearing Officer may be enforced in the same
manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (E)   In any case in which a respondent has failed to comply with a judgment
ordering that respondent to correct an ordinance violation or imposing any fine
or other sanction as a result of an ordinance violation, any expenses incurred
by the city to enforce the judgment entered against that respondent, including,
but not limited to, attorney’s fees, court costs and costs related to property
demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due and owing the city and
may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being
fixed by the Hearing Officer pursuant to this division (E), the Adjudication
Hearing Administrator shall serve a notice to the respondent that states that
respondent shall appear at a hearing before the Hearing Officer to determine
whether the respondent has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall
set forth the date for the hearing, which shall not be less than seven days
from the date service is effective, as provided in §
32.020 above.
   (F)   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 12-101 et seq.), or
by the Uniform Commercial Code (ILCS Ch. 810, Act 5, §§ 1-101 et seq.), a lien
shall be imposed on the real estate or personal property, or both, of the
respondent in the amount of any debt due and owing the city under this
subchapter. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien
pursuant to a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (G)   (1)   The Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by
default and set a new hearing date, upon a petition filed by the respondent
within 15 days after the issuance of the order of default, if the Hearing
Officer determines that the respondent’s failure to appear at the hearing was
for good cause, or at any time if the respondent establishes, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the city did not provide proper service of
process.
      (2)   In addition, for the purpose of motor vehicle violations, the
grounds for the petition may include:
         (a)   The person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle on the date the parking violation notice was first issued; or
         (b)   The person having already paid the fine or penalty for the
parking violation in question.
      (3)   If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this division, the Hearing
Officer shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien which has
been recorded for any debt due and owing the city as a result of the vacated
default judgment.
      (4)   The petitioner shall appear with appropriate evidence, so that if
the petition is granted, he or she is prepared to proceed immediately with a
hearing on the merits.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007)
RULES APPLICABLE TO MOTOR VEHICLECITATIONS
§ 32.035 ENFORCEMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLE VIOLATIONS; CITATIONS.
   (A)   Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the
code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking or standing, the owner shall
be prima facie responsible for the violation and subject to the penalty
therefor.
   (B)   Whenever any vehicle is parked in violation of any provision of the
code prohibiting or restricting vehicular parking or standing, any police
officer, traffic control aide, other designated member of the Police
Department, parking enforcement aide or other person designated by the
Adjudication Hearing Administrator observing the violation may issue a parking
violation notice, and serve the notice on the owner of the vehicle by handing
it to the operator of the vehicle, if he or she is present, or by affixing it
to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. The issuer of the notice shall specify
on the notice his or her identification number, the particular parking
regulation allegedly violated, the make and state registration number of the
cited vehicle, and the place, date, time and nature of the alleged violation
and shall certify the correctness of the specified information by signing his
or her name as provided in § 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, ILCS Ch.
625, Act 5, § 11-208.3, as amended.
   (C)   The parking violation notice shall contain the information required
under the previous division. In addition, the notices shall state the
applicable fine as provided herein, the monetary penalty which shall be
automatically assessed for late payment, the vehicle immobilization and
driver’s license suspension that may be imposed if fines and penalties are not
paid in full, that payment of the indicated fine, and of any applicable penalty
for late payment, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation, and
information as to the availability of an administrative adjudication hearing in
which the violation may be contested on its merits and the manner in which the
hearing may be had.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any person, other than the owner of the
vehicle or his or her designee, to remove from a vehicle a parking violation
notice affixed pursuant to this subchapter.
   (E)   The Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall distribute parking
violation notices to parking enforcement aides, other persons authorized to
issue parking violating notices, and the Department of Police for issuance
pursuant to these provisions. The Chief of Police shall be responsible for the
distribution of the notice forms within the Department of Police, shall
maintain a record of each set of notices issued to individual members of the
department and shall retain a receipt for every set so issued.
   (F)   The Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall compile and maintain
complete and accurate records relating to all parking violation notices issued
and the dispositions thereof, whether by payment of the fine or by final
determination of the Hearing Officer. In addition, the traffic compliance
administrator shall make certified reports to the Secretary of State pursuant
to § 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
(Ord. 2007-03-0090O, passed 3-27-2007) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 32.036 DETERMINATION OF LIABILITY; MOTOR VEHICLE CITATIONS.
   (A)   Any person on whom a parking violation notice has been served pursuant
to this subchapter shall within seven days from the date of the notice: pay the
indicated fine; or request an administrative adjudication hearing as provided
by this subchapter to contest the charged violation. A response by mail shall
be deemed timely if postmarked within seven days of the issuance of the notice
of violation.
   (B)   If the respondent requests an administrative hearing to contest the
cited violation, the Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall notify the owner
in writing of the location and time for a hearing in accordance with provisions
of §
32.020 above.
   (C)   If no response is made in accordance with division (A) of this
section, the Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall set a hearing and cause a
notice of violation to be sent to the respondent in accordance with §
32.020 above. The notice shall specify that the respondent may avoid a hearing
by paying the fine described in the notice prior to the date of the hearing and
that payment of the fine shall constitute a final disposition of the citation.
   (D)   Where a respondent either fails to pay the indicated fine prior to the
hearing or fails to appear at a hearing, a final determination of parking
violation liability shall be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the
notice of violation. Failure to pay the fine within 21 days of issuance of a
Hearing Officer’s final determination of liability will result in the
imposition of a late payment penalty pursuant to division (E) herein. Upon the
occurrence of a final determination of parking violation liability and after
expiration of the period in which judicial review under the Illinois
Administrative Review Law may be sought any unpaid fine or penalty will
constitute a debt due and owing the city. The notice of violation issued under
divisions (B) or (C) above shall provide the above information.
   (E)   Failure by any respondent to pay or mail payment of the fine for a
parking violation within 21 days of the issuance of the final determination of
liability will automatically subject the respondent to a penalty for late
payment. The penalty for late payment shall be $10.
   (F)   A person charged with a parking violation may contest the charge
through an administrative adjudication hearing limited to one or more of the
following grounds with appropriate evidence to support:
      (1)   That the respondent was not the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle at the time of the violation;
      (2)   That the cited vehicle or its state registration plates were stolen
at the time the violation occurred;
      (3)   That the relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking were
missing or obscured:
      (4)   That the relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned
through no fault of the respondent;
      (5)   That the facts alleged in the parking violation notice are
inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was
violated.

§ 32.038 IMMOBILIZATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   The Adjudication Hearing Administrator is hereby authorized to direct
and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of enforcing
the parking regulations of the code. The program of vehicle immobilization
shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle registered to the owner by
immobilizing in place or towing, as defined in division (C) below.
   (B)   If the eligible vehicle is parked or left in violation of any
provision of the Traffic Code for which the vehicle is subject to an immediate
tow, or in any place where it constitutes an obstruction or hazard, or where it
impedes city workers during such operations as snow removal, the vehicle may be
towed to a vehicle pound or relocated to a legal parking place and there
restrained.
   (C)   (1)   When the registered owner of any vehicle has accumulated three
or more final determinations of parking violation or automated traffic law
enforcement system liability for which the fines and penalties, if applicable,
have not been paid in full, the Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall cause
a notice of impending vehicle immobilization to be sent as prescribed in this
subchapter.
      (2)   The notice of impending vehicle immobilization shall state the name
and address of the registered owner, the state registration number of the
vehicle or vehicles registered to the owner, and the serial numbers of parking
violation notices which have resulted in final determination of liability for
which the fines or penalties remain unpaid.
      (3)   Failure to pay the fines and penalties owed within 21 days from the
date of the notice will result in the inclusion of the state registration
number of the vehicle or vehicles of the owner on an immobilization list.
      (4)   A person may challenge the validity of the notice of impending
vehicle immobilization by requesting a hearing and appearing in person to
submit evidence which would conclusively disprove liability. Upon a request for
a hearing, the Adjudication Hearing Administrator shall schedule the hearing
for the next regular hearing date.
      (5)   Documentary evidence which would conclusively disprove liability
shall be based solely on the following grounds:
         (a)   That all fines and penalties for the parking violations cited in
the notice have been paid in full; or
         (b)   That the registered owner has not accumulated three or more
final determinations of parking violation or automated traffic law enforcement
system liability which were unpaid at the time the notice of impending vehicle
immobilization was issued.
      (6)   The hearing on eligibility for impoundment shall not provide a
venue for a collateral attack on the original determinations of liability
except to contest service of process.
   (D)   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a post immobilization and
towing notice shall be sent to the owner, or if the vehicle is immobilized in
place, affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
      (1)   The affixed notice shall warn that the vehicle is immobilized and
that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in its damage. The notice shall
also state that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the immobilizing
restraint is a violation of ILCS Ch. 720, Act 5, §§ 16-1 and 21-1, the Illinois
Criminal Code, The notice shall also provide information specifying how release
of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may
obtain a post-immobilization hearing. If the restraint has not been released
within 24 hours of its placement, the restraint shall be released and the
vehicle towed and impounded.

vehicle immobilized by towing. The notice shall contain:

         (c)   The case number;
         (d)   Reference to the cause of the tow for immobilization;

charges;
         (f)   The name, address, telephone number, and hours of operation of
the storage facility where the vehicle can be claimed upon payment of towing,
storage fees, fines and penalties owed.
   (E)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle or other authorized person may
secure the release of the vehicle by paying the immobilization, towing and
storage fees provided in division (H) herein, and all fines and penalties
remaining due on each final determination of parking violation liability issued
to that person.
   (F)   The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to a post-
immobilization hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any
subsequent towing and impoundment was erroneous, if the owner files a written
request for a hearing with the Adjudication Heating Administrator within 14
days after immobilization or 14 days of the date of the notice sent pursuant to
division (G) herein, whichever is later. The determination of the Hearing
Officer regarding the validity of the immobilization shall become final for the
purpose of judicial review under the Administrative Review Law of Illinois upon
issuance.
   (G)   Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, a notice of
impoundment shall be sent by first class mail, to the address of the registered
owner as listed with the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that the
owner has the right to request a post-immobilization and post-towing hearing as
provided in division (E) herein, and that if the vehicle is not claimed within
30 days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 4-208, the Illinois
Vehicle Code.
   (H)   The fee for immobilization in place shall be $50 and/or a fee for
towing subsequent to the immobilization and a storage fee for every 24-hour
period the vehicle is retained shall be assessed. No fees shall be assessed for
any immobilization or tow which has been determined to be erroneous.
   (I)   It shall be unlawful to relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an
immobilization device without the approval of the Adjudication Hearing
Administrator or his or her designee. The registered owner of the immobilized
vehicle and any person who relocates an immobilized vehicle in violation of
this division shall each be subject to a penalty of $750 for the violation.

cause a notice of impending driver’s license suspension to be sent in the form
as required by the Secretary of State. The notice shall state that failure to
pay the amount owing within 45 days of the date of the notice will result in

the ten or more violations indicated on the report. The Adjudication Hearing
Administrator shall send notice of the decision on the challenge of the report
after receipt thereof. The challenge to the eligibility for suspension
proceedings, and any hearing requested under division (E) below, shall not
provide a venue for a collateral attack on the original determinations of
liability except to contest service of process.

reported fine or penalty or if the report is determined by the Adjudication
Hearing Administrator to be in error, the Adjudication Hearing Administrator

      (3)   The provisions of this manual shall be approved by the City
Council. Administration of the manual shall be the responsibility of the City
Administrator.
      (4)   Failure to follow the procedures outlined in this manual may lead
to disciplinary action in accordance with the provisions of the City of Oak
Forest personnel policy manual.
   (B)   Purchasing policies.
      (1)   Code of ethics. All city personnel engaged in purchasing and
related activities shall conduct business dealings in a manner above reproach
in every respect. Transactions relating to expenditure of public funds require
the highest degree of public trust to protect the interests of the city and the
residents of Oak Forest. City employees shall strive to:
         (a)   Ensure that public money is spent efficiently and effectively
and in accordance with statutes, regulations and city policies;
         (b)   Maintain confidentiality at all times;
         (c)   Not accept gifts or favors from current or potential suppliers,
which might compromise the integrity of their purchasing function;
         (d)   Purchase without favor of prejudice;
         (e)   Ensure that all potential suppliers are provided with adequate
and identical information upon which to base their offer or quotation and that
any subsequent information is made available to all bidders;
         (f)   Establish and maintain procedures to ensure that fair and equal
consideration is given to each offer or quotation received and selection is
based upon the lowest responsible bid;
         (g)   Offer a prompt and courteous response to all inquires from
potential or existing suppliers;
         (h)   Responsibly plan purchases to insure that the need for
“emergency” approvals reflects true emergencies; and
         (i)   It shall be the responsibility of the City Administrator to
determine if a violation of this code of ethics has occurred and if
disciplinary action is necessary in accordance with the city’s personnel
manual.
      (2)   Approval of city purchases. No employee shall purchase goods or
services on behalf of the city without first seeking approval as required by
this policy. All purchases shall require advance approval of the appropriate
department head, purchasing agent or the City Council in accordance with the
guidelines described in this division:
 
Dollars Limits       Required Approval
Up to $1,000         Department head
$1,001.00 to $10,000 City Administrator
$10,001 and above    City Council
 
      (3)   Regular purchase orders. All purchases exceeding $1,000 shall
require the issuance of a regular purchase order to the vendor before an order
for goods or services is filled. Employees shall be responsible for planning
for purchases exceeding $1,000 in advance, and should allow sufficient time to
have a requisition processed and purchase order issued and mailed to the
vendor. Vendors must indicate the correct purchase order number on an invoice
and forward it to the Finance Clerk to process it for payment.
      (4)   Change orders to regular purchase orders. After a regular purchase
order is issued to the vendor, it may become necessary to change it to include
additional quantities, shipping costs and the like. If the actual purchase
exceeds the requisition by more than 10%, the department head should forward a
request to edit the purchase order to the controller indicating the reason for
the increase. If the change is less than or equal to 10%, no action is
necessary.
      (5)   Blanket purchase orders. Blanket purchase orders are intended to
give employees flexibility when purchasing mass quantities from the same vendor
on a recurring basis (e.g., concrete, patching material, car washes). Blanket
purchase orders will be issued to a vendor on a monthly basis. The department
head shall enter a requisition for the approximate quantity needed for the
month. The controller will approve the monthly expenditure and issue a purchase
order. The purchase order will be closed at the end of the month. In instances
where a blanket purchase order has been issued, it is not necessary to process
a requisition and have a regular purchase order issued in advance of obtaining
the goods. Employees may obtain items from vendors in the field upon approval
of the department head. Vendors must reference the correct blanket purchase
order number on an invoice and forward it to the Finance Clerk to process it
for payment.
      (6)   Contract purchase order. Contract purchase orders shall be issued
if the city has an annual contract with a vendor or supplier (e.g., insurance
policy, maintenance contract). Contract purchase orders will be created by the
Finance Clerk at the beginning of each fiscal year. Department heads should
forward the terms of any contract to the controller so that a purchase order
can be created and mailed to the vendor. The purchase order will be closed at
the end of the fiscal year. Vendors must indicated the correct contract
purchase order number on an invoice and forward it to the Finance Clerk to
process it for payment.
      (7)   Union and contractual benefits. A request for payment for union and
contractual benefits paid to city employees should be forwarded to the Finance
Clerk to be included on the list of bills presented to the City Council.
Examples of union and contractual benefits include optical and dental
reimbursement, tuition reimbursement and uniform reimbursement. The check
request approved by the department head will supersede the requirement for a
purchase order.
      (8)   Grant purchases. Purchases made with grant proceeds require a
regular purchase order, if it is greater than $1,000. The department head
should request the controller to propose a budget adjustment to the City
Council if the income and expenditure was not previously budgeted.
   (C)   Competitive quotes and exceptions to the policy.
      (1)   General policy for soliciting quotes.
         (a)   Employees are responsible for obtaining quotes for purchases in
the instances outlined in this section. When requesting a purchase, quotes
should be forwarded to the purchasing agent. Requisitions submitted without the
required quotes or a satisfactory explanation of why quotes were not obtained
(e.g., sole source, emergency, standardized vendor and the like) would be
returned to the originator without approval.
 
Up to $1,500      One verbal quote is required, however, employees are
                  encouraged to seek additional quotes when possible.
                  Three quotes must be obtained and submitted to the purchasing
$1,501 to 10,000  agent with the requisition. A purchase order will be issued
                  after approval by the purchasing agent.
                  Three written quotes must be obtained and submitted to the
                  purchasing agent with the requisition. The purchasing agent
$10,001 to 20,000 will forward the request to the City Council for approval. A
                  purchase order will be issued after approval by the City
                  Council.
                  Must be competitively bid in accordance with state law and
$20,001 and above city ordinances. City Council approval is required for all
                  contracts of this dollar amount. A purchase order will be
                  issued after approval by the City Council.
 
         (b)   Items purchased more than once during a fiscal year (e.g.,
paper, office supplies and the like) do not need quotes every time a purchase
is made. However, competitive quotes for these items shall be sought at the
beginning of each fiscal year to ensure that vendors are competitive.
      (2)   Joint purchasing.
         (a)   City employees are authorized to obtain goods and services using
the State of Illinois joint purchasing program.
         (b)   When available through the state program, it is not necessary
for city employees to obtain quotes or to competitively bid the goods or
services, which are sought.
         (c)   Employees shall be responsible, however, for ensuring that the
goods or services are of a quality sufficient to meet the city's needs and that
pricing is competitive.
         (d)   When making purchases using the state’s assigned vendor,
employees shall submit a purchase requisition to the purchasing agent and shall
include the State of Illinois’ contract number. This information should be
indicated on the requisition by using the special instructions field when
entering the purchase requisition. The controller will then issue a purchase
order to the vendor.
         (e)   The city is also authorized to enter into agreements for joint
purchasing with authorized units of government under the law.
         (f)   These units include, but are not limited to, the City of
Chicago, Cook County and other municipalities in the Northwest Municipal
Conference and the South Suburban Mayors’ and Managers’ Association.
Furthermore, if a local vendor matches the contract amount in a competitively
bid joint purchase program, that vendor will be deemed the lowest responsible
bidder for that purchase.
      (3)   Sole source purchases.
         (a)   Contracts for parts, supplies or equipment that are available
only from a single source are referred to as sole source purchases.
         (b)   Sole source procurements may arise from the following
circumstances:
            1.   Equipment for which there is no comparable competitive product
or is available only from one supplier;
            2.   Public utility services from natural or regulated monopolies;
            3.   A component or replacement part for which there is no
commercially available substitute, and which can be obtained only from the
manufacturer;
            4.   An item where compatibility is the overriding consideration,
such as computer software; and
            5.   A used item, for example, a television transmitter tower, that
becomes immediately available and is subject to prior sale.
         (c)   These items shall not be subject to requirements for seeking
competitive quotes or bids. When submitting a request for purchase, the
requisitioner must indicate that the item or service is a sole source purchase.
This should be noted on the special instructions field when entering the
requisition. The controller will then issue a purchase order to the vendor.
         (d)   Sole sources purchases in excess of $10,000 shall be presented
to the City Council prior to acquisition with a request to waive bids, approve
the purchase and enter into a formal contract.
      (4)   Emergency purchases policy.
         (a)   EMERGENCIES are defined as events that could not have been
foreseen where immediate action is necessary to safeguard the public’s health
and safety. In the event of an emergency affecting the public health and
safety, the department head or his or her designee may authorize a vendor to
perform work necessary to resolve the emergency without formal bid
solicitation.
         (b)   A department head may authorize a vendor to perform any and all
work necessary only if the public health and safety could be affected.
         (c)   After the emergency has been resolved, the department shall
enter a requisition in the purchase order module for the goods or services
purchased.
         (d)   Using the requisition special instructions field, the department
shall indicate that it was an emergency and forward an explanation to the
purchasing agent.
         (e)   The controller will then issue an emergency purchase order to
the vendor.
      (5)   Waiving of bids. When appropriate, the City Council may waive the
bidding procedure and authorize a purchase by a vote of two-thirds of all
aldermen.
   (D)   Competitive bidding and requests for professional services.
      (1)   When a formal bid is required.
         (a)   All purchases of goods or services exceeding $20,000 shall be
purchased by sealed bids, formal bidding procedures and from the lowest
responsive bidder after an adequate period of public notice.
         (b)   Public notice shall be published in at least one newspaper of
general circulation in the city, at least 14 days prior to bid closing.
         (c)   The newspaper notice shall include, at a minimum, a brief
description of the item to be purchased or sold, where bid blanks and
specifications may be secured, the time and place for bid opening and a
rejection rights clause.
      (2)   Bid opening procedures. All sealed bids shall be publicly opened by
an employee as assigned by the applicable department head at the time stated in
the legal notice. The purchasing agent or his or her designee shall be present
at the bid opening as well as at least one other employee to serve as a witness
and tabulate the bid results.
      (3)   Bid lists.
         (a)   Each department shall be responsible in maintaining their own
lists of prospective bidders.
         (b)   Requests to be placed on the bid list received by City
Administrator or controller shall be forwarded to the appropriate department
head.
         (c)   Departments shall be responsible for maintaining current lists
of bidders and for determining prospective bidder’s qualifications.
      (4)   Requests for professional services.
         (a)   Some contracts, by their nature, are not adapted to award by
competitive bidding. Examples include, but are not limited to, contracts for
the services of individuals possessing a high degree of professional skill
where the education, experience or character of the individual is a significant
factor in determining their ability to meet the city’s needs.
         (b)   These contracts generally result from a request for proposal
(RFP) solicited from consultants for “professional services.”
         (c)   The city is required by the Local Government Professional
Services Selection Act to follow specific procedures when hiring an architect,
engineer or land surveyor. The procedures must be followed, unless:
            1.   The city has a satisfactory relationship for services with one
or more firms;
            2.   An emergency situation exists and an architect, engineer or
land surveyor must be selected in an expeditious manner; or
            3.   When the cost of those services is expected to be less than
$25,000. If none of these conditions apply, the city must solicit proposals.
   (E)   Minimum requirements for certain bidders on city contracts.
      (1)   Prior to the award of any contract for the purchase of any work for
the City of Oak Forest, any successful bidder shall produce each of the
following:
         (a)   Federal employee tax number if an entity other than an
individual or social security number if an individual;
         (b)   Proof of compliance with provisions of Subchapter VI of Chapter
21, Title 42 of the United States Code and Federal Executive Order No. 11246 as
amended by Executive Order No. 11375 (known as Equal Opportunity Employer
provisions);
         (c)   Certificates of insurance indicating the following coverages:
general liability workers’ compensation, complete operations, automobile,
hazardous occupation, product liability and professional liability as may be
necessary for the project and in the amounts as described in the bid
specifications;
         (d)   Proof of compliance with all provisions of the Illinois
Prevailing Wage Act, including wages, medical and hospitalization insurance and
retirement for all those trades covered in the Act.
      (2)   Failure to produce these items within five business days of the
date of written request by the city shall result in the bidder’s
disqualification. For purposes of this division (E), WORK shall mean any
repair, construction, installation or labor provided in furtherance of any
repair, construction or installation.
(2000 Code, § 2.28.020) (Ord. 2659, passed 10-8-2002; Ord. 2931, §§ 2, 3 (Exh.
A), passed - -2005; Ord. 2014-05-0495O, passed 5-27-2014)
§ 33.102 JOINT PURCHASING AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   The city shall share in centralized procurement through joint
purchasing with the state, as revised on July 1, 1972.
   (B)   The city is authorized to enter into agreements for joint purchasing
authorized units of government under the law, including the city of Chicago,
Cook County and other municipalities in the Northwest Municipal Conference and
the South Suburban Mayors’ and Managers’ Association.
(2000 Code, § 2.28.030)
§ 33.103 DOCUMENTATION OF EXPENSES.
   (A)   No expenditure of city funds shall be submitted to Council or approved
by Council, particularly for the purpose of reimbursement of expenses of
elected officials of the city, unless evidence is presented to Council as to
the following:
      (1)   The amount of the expenditure involved;
      (2)   To what business establishment, individual or other person the
expenditure was committed and is to be paid;
      (3)   When the expenditure was committed;
      (4)   The purpose or the interest of the city for which the expenditure
was committed; and
      (5)   In the case of expenditures to be assigned against expense accounts
of elected or appointed officials, those involved in the expenditure and for
whom the expenditure was committed.
   (B)   Should an item of expenditure be placed before Council for approval
without the evidence required in division (A) above available to members of
Council for inspection prior to the vote of approval, any vote of approval on
an overall list that includes such an item shall be presumed not to include
approval of an item. Without the above substantiation, items will not be
considered to be approved.
   (C)   Where evidence of an expenditure is a receipt from the use of a credit
card such as American Express, Master Card, Visa or the like, only the original
receipt of an expenditure will be acceptable evidence to the city of the
expenditure; an electrostatic (i.e., Xerox and the like) copy of the receipt
will not be acceptable evidence of the expenditure. An expenditure that is not
supported by original evidence, as set forth herein, will not be approved
regardless of a general vote of Council on an overall list that might include
an inadequately supported claim for expenditure remuneration.
   (D)   The intention of this subchapter is to seek the greatest possible
confirmation of the most efficient use of city funds. Wherever there is a
doubt, the doubt is to be resolved in favor of the proposition that the most
efficient use of city funds has not been achieved. In that case, the
expenditure will be presumed not to be most efficient and approval of Council
will be presumed not to have been given.
(2000 Code, § 2.28.040)
§ 33.104 RECYCLED PRODUCT PROCUREMENT POLICY.
   It shall be the policy of the city to encourage the procurement of recycled
products by showing a preference for recycled products which demonstrate the
same fitness and quality at a price less than, equal to or up to 10% more than
nonrecycled products, and to adhere to the following guidelines.
   (A)   All departments involved in procurement shall conduct a review of
existing product and service specifications to determine whether existing
specifications either require the use of products manufactured from virgin
materials or exclude the use of recycled products, reusable products or
products designed to be recycled.
   (B)   In the event that specifications exclude the use of recycled products
or require the use of virgin materials, then those exclusions or requirements
shall be eliminated unless demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the department
head, that recycled products would not achieve a necessary performance
standard. A copy of the findings shall be submitted to the City Administrator.
   (C)   All city departments shall recommend changes to the City Administrator
to ensure that performance standards for particular products can be met, that
specifications are not overlay stringent and that specifications will
incorporate requirements for the use of recycled materials, reusable products
and products designed to be recycled, to the maximum extent possible.
   (D)   Outside contractors bidding to provide products or services to the
city, including printing services, must demonstrate that they will comply with
the specifications described herein to the greatest extent feasible.
   (E)   When recycled products are used, reasonable efforts shall be
undertaken to label the products to indicate that they contain recycled
materials. Other recycled products used by the city shall, to the extent
practical, also indicate that they contain recycled materials.
   (F)   The city shall cooperate to the greatest extent feasible with the
South Suburban Mayors and Managers Association and neighboring city and county
governments in an effort to develop a comprehensive, consistent and effective
procurement effort intended to stimulate the market for recycled products,
reusable products and products designed to be recycled.
   (G)   All related city departments and commissions shall work cooperatively
to further the purposes of this policy. The city’s economic development process
shall incorporate the goal of stimulating the market for recycled materials.

§ 51.01 REGISTRATION FEE FOR NEW USERS.
   Every owner of property, occupant thereof and/or user of the services of the
water and/or sewerage system of the city, who is a new resident of the city,
shall pay $30 upon registering for permission to use the water and/or sewerage
system. This registration fee shall be applicable only once and shall be
nonrefundable. This registration fee shall be used to cover city expenses
involved in the operative and administrative work connected with the water and
sewer service.
(2000 Code, § 13.04.010)
§ 51.02 METERS.
   (A)   Required. All water sold or supplied by the city shall be furnished
through meters and shall be paid for at the meter rate now established by the
city or as may hereafter from time to time be established. The owners of all
property in the city in which water is used from the city system of water mains
shall have installed, as provided in this section, upon their respective
premises, a water meter of the kind designated in this section. The meter shall
be properly attached to a service pipe so as to correctly measure all city
water used on the premises.
   (B)   Tests. All meters so installed shall first be tested by a proper
officer of the city and a permit therefor shall be granted by the Director of
Public Works or another officer of the city authorized by the Mayor and
Council.
   (C)   Installation. All meters installed by the property owner or occupant
of the premises shall be placed by an employee of the Department of Public
Works or by a proper mechanic or plumber authorized by the Director. The owner
and occupant of the premises in which the meter is installed shall be liable
for the theft thereof, any breakage by freezing or otherwise or damage to it in
any manner. The owner shall replace or repair the same or any part thereof
within five days after notice by the Director or other officer of the city, and
on failure to comply with the notice, the water shall be shut off.
   (D)   Price schedule. The fee for all meters sold by the city to water
consumers will be determined based on the actual price from the city’s
supplier, plus 25% for labor, delivery and installation.
   (E)   Placement; protection.
      (1)   Upon premises where there are well-protected basements, meters
shall be set in the basements as near as possible to where the service pipe
enters the basement. All meters on service pipes connected with premises in
which there are no basements or which are inaccessible shall be set in meter
boxes to be approved by the Director or some duly authorized officer thereof.
In no event shall a meter be placed in a crawl space or in any area upon the
premises which is inaccessible.
      (2)   The owner must provide protection for the meter against freezing.
If the meter freezes, the city will repair or replace it once at no cost to the
owner. If it freezes again, it will be replaced by the city or repaired only at
cost to the owner. Meters frozen a second time shall not be considered an
emergency.
   (F)   Repairs. The owner or occupant of any building or premises where any
meter connected with a service pipe of the water supply system of the city is
installed shall see that the meter is kept and remains free from obstructions
on or around the same and that it is conveniently accessible at all reasonable
times for the purpose of reading, inspecting or repairing the same. The
Director or other employee or agent of the city shall be permitted, at all
reasonable hours, to inspect or examine the meter for the purpose of reading or
repairing the same. The water shall be turned off from any service pipe where
the meter connected therewith is not kept free, accessible and repaired as
required in this section, and the same shall not be turned on again until this
section has been complied with and until the cost of turning off and turning on
the water has been paid.
   (G)   Unauthorized connections and disturbances. No person, unless properly
authorized by the city, shall connect, disconnect, remove, repair or otherwise
disturb any water meter. No person shall turn on the supply of water to the
service pipe from which the supply has been turned off by the authority of the
city on account of nonpayment of water charges or noncompliance with this
section without first obtaining from the Director or some authorized officer of
the city a permit to do so.
   (H)   Faulty meters.
      (1)   If a meter, for any cause, fails to register the quantity of water
passing through the same for any period, the amount charged for water during
that period shall be estimated by the Director or another authorized officer of
the city. The estimate shall be based on the average amount registered during
the two preceding like periods. The charge for turning on or off the water in
all cases for a violation of this section shall be the same as is now
prescribed for that service in other cases.
      (2)   (a)   If any consumer desires to have his or her water meter
tested, he or she shall deposit with the Department of Public Works a fee as
follows, and the Department shall thereupon have the meter tested:
 
Meter Size (Inches) Fee
3/4                 $30
1 to 1-1/2          $50
 
         (b)   The fee for any other size meter will be determined based on the
actual cost to the city, including labor and burden.
      (3)   A water meter shall be considered accurate if, when subjected by
the Department to a standard test, its register indicates not to exceed 2% more
or 2% less than the actual quantity of water passing through it. If its
register exceeds 2% more than the actual quantity of water passing through it,
it shall be considered fast to that extent. If its register exceeds 2% less
than the actual quantity of water passing through it, it shall be considered
slow to that extent.
      (4)   If a meter is tested at the request of the consumer and determined
to register fast, the Department shall credit the consumer with a sum equal to
the percent by which it is fast multiplied by the amount of all bills incurred
by the consumer within the three months prior to the test. If the meter is
determined to register slow, the Department shall collect from the consumer a
sum equal to the percent by which it is slow multiplied by the amount of all
the bills incurred by the consumer for the three months prior thereto.
      (5)   If the meters tested are found to be inaccurate as noted above, the
Department shall give credit on the next water bill or bills for the amount
deposited pursuant to division (H)(2) of this section, but if the meters tested
are found to be accurate, the fee shall be retained by the Department to cover
the expense of making the test.
   (I)   Types. The Buffalo meter of the American Meter Control Company or any
other water meter constructed upon like principles and of equal merit is
adopted and approved for exclusive use in the city, provided, however, that
every other meter which may be installed shall first be approved by the
Director before it is installed.

§ 51.08 BASIS FOR FRESH WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM CHARGE.
   (A)   The fresh water supply system (F.W.S.S.) charge shall consist of a
combination of a user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement and a
debt service charge, and shall be determined periodically by Council. The total
of the user charge and debt service charge for the F.W.S.S. shall be the rate
set forth in §
51.03.
   (B)   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt
service of all outstanding loans, bonds and the like, by an estimated annual
water pumpage, to determine a charge per 1,000 gallons of water.
   (C)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by
water meters. It shall consist of operation, maintenance and replacement costs
and shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the F.W.S.S., including a replacement fund for the year; and
      (2)   Compute a user rate per 1,000 gallons of water by dividing the
amount of revenue and replacement fund required by the number of thousands of
gallons of billable flow estimated.
   (D)   The adequacy of the F.W.S.S. charge shall be reviewed annually by
certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The
F.W.S.S. charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in the debt
service charge or a change in operation, maintenance and replacement costs.
(2000 Code, § 13.04.080) (Am. Ord. 2008-04-0174O, passed 4-22-2008; Am. Ord.
2008-05-0183O, passed 5-13-2008)
§ 51.09 COMPUTATION OF FRESH WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM CHARGE.
   The F.W.S.S. charge shall be computed by the following formula:
[CW=CB(V)+CD(V)]
where:
 
CW = fresh water supply system charge per billing period
CB = basic user charge (projected annual operation maintenance and replacement
     costs/annual billable flow)
CD = debt service charge (annual debt service/annual billable flow)
V  = volume of water used per billing period
 
(2000 Code, § 13.04.090)

the owner, occupant and user are jointly and severally liable therefor to the
city.
   (B)   Bills for service shall be sent out by the city during the quarter
succeeding the period for which the service is billed. All water bills are due
and payable when sent out.

§ 52.061 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied
by the wastewater collection system of the city shall consist of a combination
of a user charge for operation, maintenance and replacement and a debt service
charge, and shall be determined periodically by Council. The total of the user
charge and debt service charge for the wastewater collection system shall be
the rate set forth in §
52.056.
   (B)   The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual debt
service of all outstanding loans, bonds and the like, by an estimated annual
water pumpage to determine a charge per 1,000 gallons of water.
   (C)   The user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water
meters. It shall consist of operation, maintenance and replacement costs and
shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater collection system, including a replacement fund for the
year; and
      (2)   Compute a user rate per 1,000 gallons of water by dividing the
amount of revenue and replacement fund required by the number of thousands of
gallons of billable flow estimated.
   (D)   The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed
annually by certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit
report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect
a change in the debt service charge or a change in operation, maintenance and
replacement costs.
(2000 Code, § 13.08.380) (Am. Ord. 2008-04-0175O, passed 4-22-2008)
§ 52.062 COMPUTATION OF WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   The wastewater service charge shall be computed by the following formula:
CW = CB(V) + CD(V)
where:
 
CW = wastewater service charge per billing period
CB = basic user rate (projected annual operation maintenance and replacement
     costs/annual billable flow)
CD = debt service charge (annual debt service/annual billable flow)
V  = volume of water used per billing period
 
(2000 Code, § 13.08.390)
§ 52.063 LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT; SURCHARGE FOR DELINQUENCY.
   (A)   The rate or charge for sewer service shall be payable quarterly. The
owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall
be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to the premises, and the
service is furnished to the premises by the city only upon the condition that
the owner, occupant and user are jointly and severally liable therefor to the
city.
   (B)   Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the city during the
quarter succeeding the period for which the service is billed. All sewer bills
are due and payable when sent out.
   (C)   All bills not paid within 30 days of the close of the billing period
shall have a surcharge of 5% added thereto.
(2000 Code, § 13.08.400)
§ 52.064 NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY; DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE AND FEE FOR
RECONNECTION.
   If the charge for sewer service is not paid within 75 days after the close
of the billing period for the service, the City Clerk is authorized and
directed to cause notification to be given in writing to the owner of the
premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service that a delinquency
exists, and that service shall be discontinued without further notice unless
payment in full is received at the City Hall within five days of the mailing of
the notice. Upon the disconnecting of any service, a charge of $100 shall be
made for reconnecting the same after settlement of all charges.
(2000 Code, § 13.08.410)
§ 52.065 LIENS.
   (A)   Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for 105 days after it
has been rendered, the city shall file with the county’s Recorder of Deeds a
statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain a legal description of
the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill and a notice that the city
claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the
period covered by the bill.
   (B)   If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and
the city has notice of this, notice of delinquency and lien filing shall be
mailed to the owner of the premises, if his or her address is known to the
city, whenever a bill remains unpaid for 105 days after it has been rendered.
   (C)   The failure of the city to record a lien or to make a notice, or the
failure of the owner to receive a notice, shall not affect the right to
foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as set forth in §
52.066.
(2000 Code, § 13.08.420)
§ 52.066 FORECLOSURE OF LIENS.
   Property subject to a lien for unpaid sewer service charges shall be sold
for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to
pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of
statutory liens. The foreclosures shall be by bill-in-equity in the name of the
city. The City Attorney is authorized and directed to institute the proceedings
in the name of the city in any court having jurisdiction over the matters
against any property for which a bill has remained unpaid for 105 days after it
has been rendered.
(2000 Code, § 13.08.430)
§ 52.067 APPEALS.
   The method for computation of rates and service charges established for user
charges in this chapter shall be made available to a user within 30 days of
receipt of a written request for such. Any disagreement over the method used or
in the computations thereof shall be remedied by the city within 30 days after
notification of a formal, written appeal outlining the discrepancies.

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling
shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or
whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pH’s are determined from periodic grab samples.

vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of
or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;

   (E)   Notice of violation.
      (1)   When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor

the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S. mail within 30 days after the
Illinois Secretary of State notifies the city of the identity of the registered
owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90 days following
the violation. The city shall only be required to notify a lessee if the
leasing company/lessor provides the lessee’s name by an affidavit and a copy of
the lease within 60 days of the notice’s issuance. If the driver information is
not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If
any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be

database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall
be made by first class mail postage prepaid.
      (2)   (a)   A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic
law violation shall require a review and approval of the associated recorded
image by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer from the
city, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle was
being operated in violation of division (B) above, or whether one of the
defenses enumerated in division (D) of this section is visibly applicable upon
inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and
that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the
registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The Traffic
Compliance Administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded
images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice
of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and
is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above-noted
statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation
subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this section.
         (b)   Where a vehicle crosses a stop line or crosswalk but still comes
to a complete stop and does not proceed to further enter the intersection
during the red light cycle, no violation shall be issued unless one or more
pedestrians or cyclists are present.
      (3)   The notice of violation shall include the following information:
         (a)   The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the

penalty should be paid (21 days from the date of issuance) and a statement that
the payment of the fine shall operate at a final disposition of the violation;
         (h)   A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date
noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or
lessee;
         (i)   The amount of the late fee;
         (j)   A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will
result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension
of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle;
         (k)   A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie
evidence of a violation;
         (l)   A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the
fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing;
and
         (m)   A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested.
   (F)   Hearing.
      (1)   The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of this section
may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of violation (21
days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an
applicable defense.
      (2)   The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts
contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a
violation of this section.
      (3)   The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this
section.
      (4)   The owner’s failure to appear at the hearing will result in a
finding of liability.
      (5)   In the event of a failure to appear, a “findings, decision and
order” letter will be sent to the owner.
      (6)   The owner’s failure to pay the amount by the date specified in that
letter will result in a final determination.
      (7)   The owner or violator shall have 25 days following an
administrative hearing to pay any penalty imposed.
   (G)   Non-residents.
      (1)   Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle is not a
resident of the city but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged violation,
that person may contest the charges using the same available defenses as stated
above, but rather than attend the administrative hearing, they may submit any
and all documentary evidence to the Traffic Compliance Administrator no later
than the hearing date, together with a written statement reflecting that they
are non-residents of the city.
      (2)   The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall forward all timely-
submitted materials to the Hearing Officer for review and determination.
   (H)   Final determination.
      (1)   A final determination of violation liability shall occur following
failure to pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing by the respond-by date,
after a Hearing Officer’s determination of violation liability and the
exhaustion of or failure to exhaust the administrative review procedures
provided by the City Code.
      (2)   Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged
violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the
Hearing Officer’s determination shall become final upon a failure to pay the
amount owed on date provided in the “findings, decision and order” letter.
Appeal may be made to the Circuit Court of Cook County on any final
determination as provided for by the Administrative Review Act.
   (I)   Notice of determination of liability. If the registered owner fails to
pay or contest the notice of violation within 21 days a notice of determination
of liability will be sent to the owner indicating that a fine in the amount of
$100 is due to the city. The notice will also state that the owner can petition
the city to set aside the determination of liability before it becomes final.
If the owner does not pay the $100 as specified in the notice or petition the
city to set aside the determination, within 21 days, a notice of final
determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has exhausted

notice shall be mailed as provided herein to the address furnished.
   (B)   Posting of signs showing hearing rights. All approved towing service
operators shall prominently post at least one sign, with dimensions of at least

to contest the validity of a towed vehicle. The sign, the form for which is set
out in §
74.07(A), shall be placed in locations readily visible to the public
transacting business at any towing facility. If a towing service operator
performs services for more than one city, the information for contacting the
various appropriate municipal offices can be listed in one sign, the format for
which shall be substantially similar to the form set forth in §
74.07(A).
   (C)   Requests for post-tow hearings. Requests for hearings may be made in
person at the office indicated on the notice within 15 days of the mailing or
personal delivery of the notification of tow, or release of the vehicle,

period.
   (D)   Release of motor vehicles. Before the owner or person entitled to
possession of any impounded vehicle shall be permitted to remove the same, the
owner or person entitled to possession shall furnish evidence of his or her
identity, ownership of the vehicle or right to possession, shall sign a receipt
for the vehicle and shall pay the amount currently owed for towing and storage
fees to the towing service operator. The Chief of Police is authorized to
promulgate regulations as to the documents or other proof necessary to
establish these facts.
   (E)   Establishment of maximum towing and storage rates.
      (1)   The owner shall pay fees to the towing service operator for towing
and storage on police-ordered tows at rates not to exceed maximum amounts to be
administratively established by the Chief of Police and which may be revised
from time to time.
      (2)   The basic rates for the fees shall be shown in the form and sign
concerning vehicle release requirements, as set forth in §
74.07(A). However, nothing in this section is intended to prevent a competitive
towing service operator from charging less than the established maximum rates
for police-ordered tows or any other tows. In arriving at the maximum rates for
various services, the Chief shall consider the matters as the prevalent market
rates in the area for the different types of vehicles, the types of storage and
area requirements for categories as large trucks and commercial vehicles and
the relative difficulties and amount of work required to perform various types
of towing operations.
      (3)   For particularly difficult or unusual towing jobs, such as large or
serious accidents, the Chief is authorized to allow towing operators to charge
rates above those established for normal situations. Those special charges must
be based upon the cost of services provided, taking into account matters as the
man-hours and equipment time required for the job.
      (4)   A towing service operator shall fully itemize, in writing, the
details of a billing at special rates for a particularly difficult or unusual
tow and shall supply a copy of the itemized bill to the owner and to the Police
Department. Any special rates charged shall be customary in the towing industry
in the area for the nature and extent of the services provided.
      (5)   Every towing service operator and the Police Department shall make
available a copy of the complete current rate schedule and any special rate
policy established by the Chief of Police, for vehicle owners to view upon
request.
(2000 Code, § 10.36.050)
§ 74.06 POST-TOW HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Opportunity for hearing. The owner of a vehicle towed as an immediate
tow, by or pursuant to the authority of the Police Department as set forth in §
74.02 above, shall be provided an opportunity for a post-tow hearing to
determine the validity of the tow and any towing or storage charges. The
hearing will not be determinative of, or adjudicate, any citation issued
relative to any towed vehicle.
   (B)   Nature of the hearing; appointment of Hearing Officer. The nature of
the hearing and the appointment of the Hearing Officer shall be the same as set
forth in §
74.04(D) and (E).
   (C)   Scheduling of hearings. Hearings shall take place as follows:
      (1)   In those instances where a vehicle has been released upon the
deposit of the full payment currently owed for towing and storage charges, and
the owner has properly requested a hearing, the hearing shall take place within
15 days after the release of the vehicle, unless the owner requests a later
date convenient to all parties.
      (2)   In those instances where a vehicle remains impounded, the hearing
shall take place, at the option of the owner:
         (a)   On the next day after an owner’s demand for the hearing,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, if such demand is made after 3:00
p.m.;
         (b)   On the second day following the demand, excluding Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays, if the unavailability of a necessary witness or evidence
creates a particular difficulty in conducting the hearing on the next calendar
day; or
         (c)   Within 15 days of the request, on a date convenient to all
parties, if acceptable to the owner.
   (D)   Conduct of hearings. The Hearing Officer shall review all evidence
presented by the vehicle owner and the Police Department or other city
employees and shall make a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence
presented, as to the lawful authority for the towing and storage of the
vehicle. The city must establish the authority by a preponderance of the
evidence.
   (E)   Hearing decision. For each hearing, the Hearing Officer shall complete
a post-tow hearing decision, shall attach the decision to the Police
Department’s original vehicle towing report, and shall supply a copy of the
decision to the owner by personal delivery, if the owner is present, or by
mail, if the owner isn’t present. The decision and findings shall be
substantially as stated in the form for a post-tow hearing decision, set forth
in §
74.09 below.
   (F)   Retention of reports and documents; contesting decisions. All
originals and copies of notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports and
any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the Police
Department for a period of at least five years after each hearing, or after
each tow if no hearing was requested or held. The city or the owner may contest
the decision of the Hearing Officer in any manner provided by law.
   (G)   Compliance with chapter. Notwithstanding any other ordinance or
statutory provision to the contrary, any towing service operator authorized to
perform tows on behalf of the city must perform its services subject to the
provisions of this chapter. However, the towing company shall have the right to
recover the reasonable value of its services for police-ordered tows, which are
not paid by the vehicle owner, from the city. However, if a tow or the charge
for a tow is found to be illegal and the towing service operator is required to
return the charge for the tow to the owner of the vehicle, the city shall not
be liable to reimburse the operator for the towing charges.
(2000 Code, § 10.36.060)

TREES AND PARKWAYS
§ 90.100 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the proper parkway
standards and establishment of new trees, the protection and maintenance of
existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous or infectious diseased trees
on both public and private property.
   (B)   It is further intended to balance the property rights of individual
property owners with those of the overall health, safety and welfare interests
of the city. Trees enhance and preserve the air quality of the city through the
filtering effect of trees on air pollutants, reduce noise within the city
through the baffle and barrier effect of trees on the spread of noise, reduce
topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of tree roots, reduce energy
consumption through the wind break and shade effects, provide nesting areas for
birds and other wildlife which in turn assist in the control of insects, reduce
storm water runoff and the costs associated therewith, replenish ground water
supplies and protect and increase property values.

§ 91.093 DETERMINATION.
   (A)   Within 60 days after the effective date of this subchapter, the
Director shall evaluate all buildings in the city he believes to be unoccupied
on the effective date of this subchapter and make a determination for each as
to whether the building is a "vacant building" within the meaning of §
91.092. The Director may determine that a building which meets any of the
criteria set forth in §
91.092 is not to be regulated under this subchapter for a stated period, if
upon consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient evidence, he or
she determines that regulation of the building under this subchapter would not
serve the public health, welfare, and safety and makes written findings in
support of his decision. The determination shall be in writing and shall state
the factual basis for the determination. For buildings the Director determines
to be "vacant buildings", he shall, within seven days of making that
determination, send notice of his written determination with the factual
findings to the last taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Cook County
tax roll. Said notice of determination shall be sent first class United States
mail, with proper postage prepaid. Failure of delivery shall not excuse a
person from complying with this chapter. The Director may personally serve or
cause personal service of the notice of determination. Any person making such
service shall execute an affidavit attesting to the facts of service. The
Director shall maintain an affidavit of such mailing for each notice of
determination sent.
   (B)   The notice shall specify a date and time on which the owner shall
allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building
to determine the extent of compliance with city property, building codes,
health, fire, water and sewer codes. The owner shall pay the $500 inspection
fee to the city within 30 days of the inspection. An unpaid fee shall be a lien
upon the premises.
   (C)   The notice shall contain a statement of the obligations of the owner
of a building determined to be a vacant building, a copy of the registration
form the owner is required to file pursuant to §
91.095, and a notice of the owner's right to appeal the Director's
determination.
(Ord. 2008-07-0193O, passed 7-22-2008)
§ 91.094 APPEAL OF DETERMINATION.
   (A)   An owner of a building determined by the Director to be a vacant
building as provided for in this subchapter may appeal that determination to
the City Administrator. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with
the City Administrator within 15 days of the date of mailing of the notice of
determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner's obligation to register
his building as required by §
91.095. The appeal shall contain a complete statement of the reasons the owner
disputes the Director's determination, shall set forth specific facts in
support thereof, and shall include all evidence the owner relies upon to
support the appeal. The City Administrator shall decide the appeal on the basis
of facts presented by the owner in his or her written appeal and the Director's
written determination.
   (B)   The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to
persuade the City Administrator that had the evidence been known to the
Director at the time the Director made the determination, the Director would
more likely than not have determined that the subject building was not a
"vacant building" within the meaning of this subchapter.
   (C)   The City Administrator shall send written notice of his decision to
the owner within ten days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The City
Administrator may, but is not required to, seek additional information from the
owner. The City Administrator may, upon written notice thereof to the owner,
take no more than ten additional days, to decide the appeal if he or she
determines that such additional time is required for consideration of the
appeal.
   (D)   An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this subchapter to
his or her building without the Director's determination having been made,
shall set forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in a writing to the
Director. In the event the Director determines that the subject building is a
"vacant building", the owner shall have the right to appeal the Director's
determination to the City Administrator as provided for herein.
(Ord. 2008-07-0193O, passed 7-22-2008)
§ 91.095 OBLIGATION TO REGISTER.

should know, that his or her building is or has become a "vacant building"
within the meaning of this subchapter after the effective date of this
subchapter or the owner of a building, which the Director determines at any
time to be a "vacant building", or the owner of a building whose appeal from
the Director's determination has been denied by the City Administrator shall
take the actions provided for in this section within 15 days after either the
date of the Director's notice of determination or occurrence of the facts which
would cause a reasonable person to believe that the building was a "vacant
building", or denial of the appeal, whichever is applicable. Registration does
not exonerate the owner from compliance with all applicable codes and
ordinances, including this subchapter, nor does it preclude any of the actions
the city is authorized to take pursuant to this subchapter or elsewhere in this
Code.

Director the information required regarding the person designated to accept
notice and service of process.
      (2)   The owner shall allow for a code compliance inspection of the
interior of the vacant building and shall pay the $500 fee therefor within 30
days of the inspection. Such inspection will determine the extent of compliance
with city property, building codes, health, fire, water and sewer codes. The
city shall send the inspection report to the owner within 30 days.

a vacant residential building of more than 48 units; and $2,000,000 for a
vacant manufacturing, industrial, storage, or nonresidential commercial
building.
   (D)   Vacant building plan. At the time a building is registered as required
herein, the owner shall submit a vacant building plan. The Director may
prescribe a form for the plan. If the owner fails to submit the plan as
provided for by this subchapter, the Director may determine the plan. The plan
shall contain the following as a minimum:
      (1)   A plan of action to repair any doors, windows, or other openings
which are boarded up or otherwise secured by any means other than conventional
methods used in the design of the building or permitted for new construction or

secure state until the building is reoccupied or made available for immediate
occupancy. If the owner demonstrates that securing of the building will provide
adequate protection to the public, the Director of Community Development may
waive the requirement of an enclosure.
      (2)   For buildings and premises thereof which are determined by the
Director as being or containing public nuisances, as defined in §
91.092, then the vacant building plan shall contain a plan of action to remedy

will be approved.
      (7)   All premises upon which unoccupied or vacant buildings are located
and the exteriors shall at all times be maintained in compliance with this
Code.

Director and available from the Director.

service shall be required when the Director makes a written determination that
the vacant building constitutes a fire hazard, is otherwise dangerous to human
life or the public welfare, involves illegal or improper use, occupancy, or
maintenance, under such conditions that boarding and securing the building are
insufficient to prevent the actual or threatened harm.

§ 111.45 APPROVAL, DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
   (A)   All applications for a license under this subchapter shall be
delivered to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner. It shall be the duty of the
Local Liquor Control Commissioner to investigate and consider all applications.
For this purpose the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may enlist the aid of
the Chief of Police and any other city officials or employees that he or she
deems necessary to complete the investigation. The investigation shall include
a background search and credit check. At any time during the pendency of any
such application(s), the Local Liquor Commissioner shall have the right to
compel the applicant to submit to any examination and to produce any books and
records which, in the judgment of the Local Liquor Commissioner, are material
to the determination of whether the applicant is qualified to receive a license
or manage the business on the licensed premises (as the case may be) under the
provisions of this code, or whether the premises sought to be licensed are
suitable for such purposes. The Local Liquor Commissioner shall also have the
right to require the applicant to answer any charges made in any objection to
the issuance of the license made by the Chief of Police, a prosecuting
official, or by the sheriff or prosecuting attorney of the county relative to
the same. The failure of any applicant to appear at the time and place fixed by
the Local Liquor Commissioner for his or her examination or to produce books
and records when requested, unless for good cause shown, shall be deemed to be
an admission that the applicant is not qualified to receive a license and/or
not qualified to be a manager, as the case may be, and, therefore, a basis for
denial of the license or disqualification of the proposed manager, as the case
may be.
   (B)   Upon completion of the investigation, the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner shall approve or disapprove the issuance of a license and/or
designation of the manager based on the application(s), provided, in the case
of approval, that there exists an available license as set forth in §
111.48.

same by virtue of ILCS Ch. 235, Act 5, § 6-2, as amended.

required to provide satisfactory proof that the above requirements have been
met.
   (D)   Further provided, however, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may,
as a condition to the issuance of any liquor license, impose such conditions
and restrictions upon each license as the Local Liquor Control Commissioner may
deem necessary to insure that operation of the liquor establishment shall not

   (B)   Any change in partnerships, officers, directors or managers of
establishments licensed under this subchapter, or persons holding directly,

§ 111.55 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   (A)   A liquor license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for a term
not to exceed the period for which the same is issued unless sooner revoked, as
provided in this subchapter, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be
subject to attachment, garnishment or execution nor shall it be alienable or
transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or
hypothecated. Such license shall not descent by the laws of testate or
intestate devolution, but it shall cease upon the death of the licensee,
provided that the executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased
licensee and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when the estate
consists in part of liquor, under order of the appropriate court, may exercise
the privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the
death of such license but not linger more than six months after the death,
bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee.
   (B)   When the licensee is a corporation or limited liability company, the
license shall terminate whenever 50% or more of the ownership interest therein
changes from that shown on the original license application. In such event, the
corporation or limited liability company, through its officers, must make
application for the issuance of a new license as provided herein; provided,
however, that the provisions of this subsection shall not apply where the
transfer of an ownership interest is made to an owner shown on the original
license application who owned 50% or more of the ownership interest of such
corporation or limited liability company at the time the original license
application was filed with the city.
   (C)   When the licensee is a partnership or corporation or limited liability
company, no change in ownership from that shown on the original application
involving the addition of a new partner of such partnership or a new
shareholder of the corporation, or a new member of the limited liability
company, who will have an ownership interest in the aggregate more than 5%,
shall be effective until such proposed change in ownership has first been
reported in writing to the Local Liquor Commissioner and said Commissioner
finds that the proposed new partner, shareholder or member is not ineligible
under the provisions of this subchapter and so advises the licensee in writing.
Any change in ownership without complying with the terms hereof shall
constitute grounds for revocation of the liquor license issued pursuant hereto.
   (D)   Any licensee may seek to renew his or her license at the expiration
thereof pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter provided he or she is
then qualified to receive a license and the premises for which such renewal
license is sought are suitable for such purpose; and provided, further, that
the renewal privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested
right which shall in any case prevent the Board of Trustees from decreasing or
increasing the number of licenses to be issued within the city, nor shall it
limit or restrict the right of the city to at any time amend or repeal any or
all provisions of this subchapter.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any other provision herein, where ownership in a sole
proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company or corporation is
transferred solely to any person or persons found qualified pursuant to
application under this code to hold a liquor license in the city and proven to
be a parent or a son or daughter of the prior owner and where such transfer of
ownership under this code requires the issuance of a new liquor license, no
additional fee for a new liquor license shall be assessed for the year in which
the transfer of ownership is made; instead, the fee for that year’s liquor
license shall be pro-rated between or among the owners as follows:
      (1)   The first owner shall pay the entire amount; and
      (2)   The subsequent owner shall pay a pro-rated amount based on the date
on which ownership is acquired; and
      (3)   Upon receipt of payment of the pro-rated amount the city shall
return to the first owner that same pro-rated amount.
   (F)   Upon payment of the pro-rated amount a new license in the name of the
new owner or owners shall be issued which shall be effective only for that
portion of the year for which the prorated amount was paid.

partnership, firm or corporation for a period of one year thereafter for the
sale of alcoholic liquor in the premises described in the revoked license.

§ 111.57 CESSATION OF BUSINESS.
   (A)   Any licensee who ceases to do business or closes his or her place of
business for a period of more than 30 successive days shall be subject to
having his or her license declared forfeited and lapsed by order of the Liquor
Control Commissioner.
   (B)   Provided, however, if any licensee wishes to close for repairs or
remodeling, the licensee shall so notify the Liquor Control Commissioner, and
indicate the work to be done and the construction schedule for the work. The
licensee shall also request from the Liquor Control Commissioner approval to
cease doing business for such purpose, and, if approved, the Liquor Control
Commissioner will indicate the period of time for which the temporary cessation
has been approved in the order permitting such temporary cessation of business.
   (C)   If, due to no fault of the licensee, the remodeling or repairs
continue for a longer period of time than originally approved, the licensee
shall so notify the Liquor Control Commissioner and the order of the Liquor
Control Commissioner shall then be revised accordingly if the Local Liquor
Commissioner agrees to such extension of time. Such revised order shall
indicate a new date for completion of all work.
   (D)   However, no such business shall be allowed to cease doing business for
such remodeling or repairs for a period in excess of one year unless and until
an extension has been granted in writing by the Local Liquor Commissioner.
   (E)   There shall be no reduction or proration of the license fee for any
period of time during remodeling.

   (D)   If the Local Liquor Control Commissioner has reason to believe that
any continued operation of a particular licensed premises will immediately
threaten the welfare of the community, he or she may, upon issuance of a
written order stating the reason for such conclusion and without notice or
hearing, order the licensed premises closed for not more than seven days,
giving the licensee an opportunity to be heard during that period, except that
if such licensee shall also be engaged in the conduct of another business or
businesses on the licensed premises such order shall not be applicable to such
other business or businesses.
   (E)   To appeal to the Circuit Court or any other court of competent

§ 114.095 LATE APPLICANTS.
   The City Council, when good and compelling cause is shown therefor, may

(2000 Code, § 5.70.060)
§ 114.096 STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE.
   The City Council shall direct the City Clerk to issue a permit as provided
for hereunder when, from a consideration of the application and from such other

   (A)   The conduct of the parade will not substantially interfere with the
safe and orderly movement of traffic in the area contiguous to the route.
   (B)   The activity will not present an unreasonable danger to the health or
safety of the applicant, city employees, or members of the public, which is to
be determined upon the basis of past events that have occurred within the
corporate limits of the City of Oak Forest.
   (C)   There are available at the time of the parade, public assembly or
similar activity a sufficient number of peace officers to police and protect
lawful participants in the activity and maintain adequate police protection in
the rest of the City of Oak Forest.
   (D)   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the assembly
points of the parade, public assembly or similar activity will not unduly
interfere with the proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service
to areas contiguous to the assembly areas.
   (E)   The activity will not interfere with scheduled city functions or the

not interfere with the movement of the fire fighting equipment en route to a

   (G)   The parade is scheduled to move from its point of origin to its point

   (H)   The parade, public assembly, or similar activity is not being

insured in a form as may be determined by the City of Oak Forest to provide for
the payment of any claims for personal injuries (including death and any
injuries to city employees, agents or contractors), property damage or other
suits arising out of or connected with the public assemblies or parades. If an
organization’s most reasonable efforts are unsuccessful, the required insurance
can be waived by the City Clerk, subject to the conditions stated in this
section. In such a situation the organization must provide written proof of
their inability to obtain insurance. If prior events of the applicant in the
city have resulted in damage or injury for which the applicant did not have
insurance or did not compensate the damaged or injured parties, the City Clerk
shall require either:
         (a)   The insurance policy as stated in this section; or
         (b)   A cash security deposit in an amount based upon damage incurred
in any prior event of the applicant in the city, as determined by the City
Clerk.

days after the determination of the damage or injury.
   (J)   A hold harmless agreement shall be signed with the City of Oak Forest
holding the city harmless from any and all claims that may arise from the use
of designated public property, right of way, equipment or any injury to a city
employee, agent or contractor in conjunction with the permitted use.
   (K)   Prior to the issuance of any permit, all parade or public assembly
applicants must pay for the estimated cost of clean-up and restoration of the
area of the event and traffic control costs of any Police Department, or other
city personnel utilized in conjunction with the function at a reasonable rate
to be determined by the City Clerk. The estimated costs shall be specifically
set out in writing to the applicant prior to the issuance of the permit,
showing the basis of the estimated costs. These estimated costs shall not
include any use of city personnel to protect the public safety in an emergency
situation in conjunction with the event. In the event that the estimated costs
paid are in excess of the actual costs, the overage shall be refunded to the
applicant within 30 days after such a determination has been made. In addition,
applicants must agree to and must pay for any damage created as a result of the
public assembly or parade.
   (L)   If the City Clerk receives more than one application for a parade or
public assembly to be held at the same time and at the same place, the
applications filed first in time shall take precedence. An event shall be
considered to be “at the same time” if the event is scheduled to commence
within two hours before or after the holding of another event. If the City
Clerk receives an application for more than one parade or public assembly in a
single day, he or she may set a time for the duration of each parade or public
assembly which shall not, without the consent of the group seeking the permit,
be less than three hours.

for its consideration at the next scheduled City Council meeting. In the event
the application is denied, the City Council shall state the reasons for the
denial of the permit. The actions of the City Council shall be subject to
judicial review.

§ 114.098 ALTERNATIVE PERMIT.

114.096(A) through (F) and (J) shall be empowered to authorize the conduct of a
parade, public assembly or similar activity on a date, at a time, at a location
or over a route different from that named by the applicant. An applicant
desiring to accept an alternate permit shall within two days after notice of
the action by the City Council file a written notice of acceptance with the
City Clerk. An alternative permit shall conform to the requirements of and
shall have the effect of a parade or public assembly permit.
(2000 Code, § 5.70.090)

   Immediately upon the issuance of a parade or public assembly permit, the

construed to impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the right of the
city to acquire the property of the grantee, either by purchase or through the
exercise of the right of eminent domain, at a fair and just value. Nothing in
this subchapter shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge,
whether for a term or in perpetuity, the city’s right of eminent domain.
   (B)   Legal rights and powers. There is reserved to the city every right or
power which is required to be reserved in this subchapter or provided by law,
and the grantee, by its acceptance of the franchise, agrees to be bound thereby
and to comply with any action or requirement of the city in its exercise of
such rights or powers, whether heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the right is reserved to the city to adopt
and enforce, in addition to the terms, conditions and provisions of this
subchapter and of otherwise existing applicable ordinances, such additional
ordinances, rules and regulations as it finds necessary in the exercise of its
police powers, provided that the ordinances, rules and regulations are
reasonable and not in material or substantial conflict with the rights granted
in this subchapter.
   (C)   Waivers. Neither the granting of any franchise nor any provision of
this subchapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any
governmental right or power of the city, subject to the rights of a grantee
under its franchise and the franchise agreement.
   (D)   FCC jurisdiction. If the FCC or any other federal or state body or
agency now or hereafter exercises any paramount jurisdiction over the subject
matter of any franchise granted under this subchapter, then to the extent that
such jurisdiction pre-empts or precludes the exercise of like jurisdiction by
the city, the jurisdiction of the city shall terminate. However, the city shall
thereupon have the right to modify or amend any of the provisions of this
subchapter and of the franchise agreement to such reasonable extent as may be
necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this subchapter.
   (E)   City’s contract rights. The preemption or preclusion by the state of
the exercise by the city of any of its police powers shall not diminish,
impair, alter or affect any contractual benefit to the city or the grantee or
any contractual obligation of the grantee under any franchise issued under this
subchapter. Any and all rights, powers, privileges and authorizations arising
under this subchapter or any franchise agreement are each and all declared by
the city and any grantee accepting any franchise to be contractual in nature
and to be for the benefit of the city.
   (F)   Rules and regulations. There is reserved to the city the right to
impose rules and regulations, reasonably required, in order to better carry out
the purpose and intent of this subchapter. Before any such rules and
regulations are adopted, the city shall give notice to the grantee and afford
the grantee an opportunity to be heard.

§ 116.026 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
   A grantee shall, at its sole risk and expense, upon demand of the city made

legal proceedings, whether judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative,
legislative or otherwise, brought, instituted or had by third persons or duly
constituted authorities against or affecting the city, its officers, boards,

the other.

connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or

amendment.

time.
   (B)   Effective period. Each franchise shall take effect and be in force as

   (C)   Noninterference with use of streets. The right and privilege granted
by a franchise shall be exercised so as not to interfere with the use of the
streets by the city and such others as may be designated by the city to use

been constructed by the grantee when the city believes that the same is
interfering with the use of the streets.
   (D)   Transfers.
      (1)   No franchise shall be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or
disposed of, whether by way of sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise,
without, in each case, the prior written consent of the city, and then only
after the distribution facilities have been substantially completed and under
such conditions as the city may establish. The consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of division (D)(1) of this section,
a franchise may be mortgaged, pledged or assigned as security for the financing
of the related BTN. The mortgage, pledge or assignment may be made without the
consent of the city, but any such mortgage, pledge or assignment shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the franchise and the related franchise
agreement and to the rights of the city under this chapter.
      (3)   Reference is made to division (I)(1) of this section for the effect
of changes in ownership or control of the grantee and to division (I)(2) of
this section for rules covering control of a network by a financial
institution.
      (4)   Reference is made to §
116.057 for transfers in connection with insolvency proceedings.

and to any area henceforth added thereto during the term of the franchise.
Subject to §
116.046, the grantee shall be required to extend the network to and to offer
the services of the network to potential subscribers within the franchise
territory where there are at least a total of 40 residential dwelling units
and/or occupied commercial or industrial structures per line mile.
      (2)   Where the density of residential dwellings and occupied commercial
or industrial structures, adverse terrain or other factors render extension of
the system and offer of services impractical or technically infeasible, or
create an economic hardship, the city may, upon petition of the grantee, either
waive the extension of the network into such areas or allow the extension and
offer of services on such special terms, conditions and provisions as are
reasonable and fair to the city, the grantee and potential subscribers in the
areas.
   (F)   Specification of privileges and exemptions. No privilege or exemption
shall be granted or conferred by any franchise granted except those
specifically prescribed in this chapter.

upon the grantee and all successors, lessees or assignees as may be approved by
the city.
   (I)   Transactions affecting ownership or control.
      (1)   (a)   Express approval of Council, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, shall be required where ownership or control of more than 10% of the
right of control of or interest in the franchise or the grantee is acquired by
a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom already owns or
controls 10% or more of the right of control or interest, singularly or
collectively. Transfer from a subsidiary to a parent corporation or vice versa
shall not be considered change of control.
         (b)   At the time a franchise is granted, and annually thereafter, the
grantee shall file with the city a current list of its owners, partners (both
general and limited), officers and directors, together with a list of
shareholders having 5% or more of its stock if the grantee is a corporation.
      (2)   Any financial institution having a pledge of or other form of
security interest in a franchise, or in the assets of a grantee, for the
advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the BTN, shall
notify the city whenever it or its designee satisfactory to the city takes
control and operates the network. However, the financial institution shall also
submit a plan for the operation that will ensure continued service and
compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the financial
institution exercises control over the network. The financial institution shall
not exercise control over the network for a period exceeding one year, unless
extended by Council, at its discretion, and during the time it shall have the
right to petition the city to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If the
city finds that any transfer, after considering the legal, financial,
character, technical and other public interest qualities of the applicant, is
satisfactory, the city may transfer and assign the rights and obligations of
the franchise consistent with the public interest. The consent of the city to
the transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
      (3)   As used in this section, “grantee” does not include any affiliate
of the grantee.

anniversaries of the effective date of the franchise grant, Council shall

inquire whether the grantee is supplying a level and variety of services
equivalent to those being generally offered at that time in the industry in
comparable market situations. At the meeting, Council may consider whether the
rates of the grantee should be regulated. The grantee shall make available to
the city, if required by the city, records, documents and information which are
relevant to the meeting and inquiry.
   (B)   Modifications necessitated by FCC regulations. Any changes in the

(2000 Code, § 5.12.330)
§ 116.056 REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Grounds. The city reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted
under this chapter and to rescind all rights and privileges associated with the
franchise in the following circumstances, each of which shall represent a
default and breach under this chapter and the franchise agreement:
      (1)   A default by the grantee in the performance of any of its material
obligations under this chapter, under the franchise agreement or under any
document, contract or other term or provision entered into by and between the
city and the grantee pursuant to this chapter;
      (2)   A failure by the grantee to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or the letter of credit
required by this chapter;
      (3)   Frequent violations by the grantee of any order or ruling of any
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to the franchise;
      (4)   The grantee’s complete cessation of services for any reason within
the control of the grantee over the BTN. However, the grantee shall not be
declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any provision of this
chapter in any case in which performance of a provision is prevented for
reasons beyond the grantee’s control. Fault shall not be deemed to be beyond
the grantee’s control if it lies with a corporation or other business entity in
which the grantee holds a controlling interest, whether held directly or
indirectly. The provisions of this division shall not be construed as any
effort by the city to regulate the program content or program offerings of the
grantee. The only purpose of this division is to ensure that the grantee does
not voluntarily cease to provide service under its franchise;
      (5)   Attempts by the grantee to evade any of the provisions of this
chapter or of the franchise agreement, or the practice of any fraud or deceit
upon the city or subscribers; or
      (6)   Failure by the grantee to establish or construct the network in
compliance with the schedule set forth in §
116.046(A), or failure, for a substantial time, to provide effective
transmission and receiving services and capabilities to subscribers, provided
that if the failure is due to strikes, war, civil commotions, acts of God or
other causes beyond the control of the grantee and without the grantee’s fault,
or causes constituting excusable negligence, the time for the grantee to
establish and construct the network or to meet any other time limit imposed by
this chapter shall be extended by the amount of time of any delay resulting
from the cases. The period of delay shall be determined by the grantee, in
writing, with the consent of the city, which consent shall not be withheld
unreasonably.
   (B)   Procedures prior to revocation. If it appears to Council that one or
more grounds exist for revoking a grantee’s franchise, the following procedures
shall then be followed.
      (1)   The Mayor may make a written demand that the grantee comply with
the requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation which the
Mayor believes to be applicable. The Mayor shall provide Council with a copy of
each written demand.
      (2)   If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for 30
days following the written demand, the Mayor may place a request for
termination of the franchise upon the agenda of the next regular Council
meeting.
      (3)   With or without compliance with the foregoing, the Mayor may cause
to be served upon the grantee reasonable notice, in writing, of his or her
intent to request a revocation of the grantee’s franchise. The notice shall
state the time and place of the Council meeting and notice of the request shall
be published by the City Clerk at least once during the four-day period
preceding the Council meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the
city.
      (4)   Council shall consider the request of the Mayor and shall hear any
persons interested therein, and shall determine, at its discretion, whether or
not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
      (5)   If the failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, Council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner,
and upon such terms and conditions, as are reasonable.
      (6)   If Council determines that the failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then Council may, by motion, declare that the
franchise of the grantee shall be revoked and terminated, unless there is
compliance within such period as Council may fix.
(2000 Code, § 5.12.340)
§ 116.057 CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Insolvency proceedings. The franchise granted pursuant to this chapter
shall, at the option of Council, cease and terminate 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or trustee, however denominated, designated to take
over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless the
receivership or trusteeship has been vacated prior to the expiration of the 120
day period, or unless both of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The receivers or trustees have, within 60 days after their election
or appointment, fully complied with this chapter, and the franchise granted
pursuant hereto, and the receivers or trustees, within the 120 days, have
remedied all defaults under the franchise; and
      (2)   The receivers or trustees shall, within 60 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby the receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.
   (B)   Foreclosure or judicial sale. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee, or any part
thereof, including or excluding the franchise granted to the grantee, Council
may serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at
the sale. In this event, the franchise shall cease and terminate within 30 days
after service of the notice, unless:
      (1)   Council has approved the transfer of the franchise as and in the
manner provided in this chapter; and
      (2)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to
assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of the franchise.

§ 116.058 PROCEDURES FOLLOWING REVOCATION OR EXPIRATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (A)   Disposition of facilities. If a franchise expires, is revoked or is
otherwise terminated, the city may order the removal of the network facilities
from the city within a reasonable period of time as determined by the city.
   (B)   Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that
has been made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good a
condition as prevailed prior to the grantee’s removal of its equipment and
appliances, without affecting the electrical or telephone cable wires or
attachments. The city shall inspect and approve the condition of the public
ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal.
The liability, indemnity and insurance as provided in this chapter shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full
compliance by the grantee with all the terms and conditions of this chapter.
   (C)   Restoration by city; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure
by the grantee to complete any work required by divisions (A) and (B) hereof,
or any other work required by city ordinances, within the time established by
the city and to the satisfaction of the city, the city may cause the work to be
done and the grantee shall then reimburse the city for the costs thereof within
30 days after receipt of an itemized list of the costs. The city shall be
permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce this division.
   (D)   Extended operation. Upon either the expiration or the revocation of a
franchise, the city may permit the grantee to continue to operate the network
for an extended period of time, not to exceed six months from the date of the
expiration or revocation, operate the network itself for the period or engage a
third party to operate the network for the period. The person (hereinafter
called the interim operator) shall, as trustee for the grantee’s successor in
interest, use its best efforts to continue to operate the cable television
system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise and to
provide services that may be provided at that time. During the interim period,
the interim operator shall not sell any of the system assets, nor shall the
interim operator make any physical, material, administrative or operational
change that would tend to degrade the quality of service to the subscribers,
tend to decrease income or tend to materially increase expenses, without, in
each case, express permission, in writing, from the city. The city shall be
permitted to seek legal and equitable relief to enforce this division.
   (E)   Effect on city’s rights. The termination and forfeiture of any
franchise shall in no way affect any of the rights of the city under the
franchise or any provision of law, and the grantee may continue to maintain
records and make reports as required by this chapter until such time as all
payments due the city under this chapter have been paid and accounted for to
the reasonable satisfaction of the city.
(2000 Code, § 5.12.360)
§ 116.059 LESSER SANCTIONS.
   Nothing shall prohibit the city from enforcing its rules and regulations to
impose lesser sanctions or censures for a violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter, rather than revocation.
(2000 Code, § 5.12.370)

§ 116.073 ADOPTION OF FEE.
   The city enacts the ordinance codified in this subchapter imposing a City of
Oak Forest municipal telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee.
(2000 Code, § 5.58.040)
§ 116.074 MUNICIPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MAINTENANCE FEE.
   (A)   A city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is imposed
upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of 1% of all gross charges
charged by the telecommunications retailer to service addresses within the city
for telecommunications originating or received by the city.
   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this subchapter, the city infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the city by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this subchapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or
imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (C)   The city telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee authorized
by this section shall be collected, enforced and administered as set forth in §
116.075.

   (B)   Unless otherwise approved by the City Administrator, the
infrastructure maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications
retailer to the city not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the
month in which a bill is issued to the customer, provided, however, that the
telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed 2% of the city
infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself for expenses
incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   (C)   Remittance of the municipal infrastructure fee to the city shall be

which shall contain such information as the City Administrator may reasonably
require.
   (D)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this subchapter and any infrastructure maintenance fee collected by a
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the city. The charge imposed under division (A)
of this section by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this subchapter
shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for the services.
   (E)   If it shall appear that an amount of infrastructure maintenance fee
has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this subchapter, whether
as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then the amount shall be
credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to became due,
under this subchapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the
erroneous payment; provided, however, the City Administrator may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit. However, no claim for such credit may be made more than three years
after the date of the erroneous payment unless:
      (1)   The credit is used only to offset a claim of underpayment made by
the city within the applicable statutory period of limitations; and
      (2)   The credit derives from an overpayment made by the same
telecommunications retailer during the applicable statutory period of
limitations.
   (F)   Amounts paid under this subchapter by telecommunications retailers
shall not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as
described immediately below:

Act, ILCS Ch. 35, Act 630 §§ 1 et seq.;

public utilities prescribed in ILCS Ch. 220, Act 5, § 2-202, the Public
Utilities Act.

§ 116.076 AUDIT.
   The city shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the books and

determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to the

amount of the city infrastructure maintenance fee due to the city by the
telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the city plus 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by
the city in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed 5% of the total
amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. The sum shall be paid to the
city within 21 days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.
(2000 Code, § 5.58.070)
§ 116.077 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.

subchapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time to

disposition of supervision shall be deemed to be a discharge without

legal guardian of a minor shall be notified and required to appear in court
whenever the minor is charged with a violation of this section. To this end, it
is directed that a notice, in substantially the following form, shall be sent
to the parents or legal guardians of the minor:

of an ordinance prohibiting the possession of cannabis, and which requires the
appearance of the minor in court. You are further notified that one of the
parents or legal guardians of the minor must appear in court before the case
will be tried or disposed. If you fail to appear, the City Attorney has been
directed to have issued a subpoena to bring you into court. Failure to obey a
subpoena can result in contempt of court, with a fine or imprisonment as the
penalty.
 
      (2)   The City Attorney is directed to have subpoenas issued whenever a
parent or legal guardian of a minor does not appear in court after the first
two times the minor’s case has been before the court.

sexual excitement or sado-masochistic abuse, when the material or performance,
taken as a whole, has the following characteristics:

by a circuit court of the state, but does not include a person appointed

      (2)   Knowingly and without authority enter into or obtain control over
any motor vehicle, bicycle, aircraft or watercraft, or any part thereof, of
another person without his or her consent.
   (C)   Penalty; court supervision; restitution.
      (1)   If a minor is found guilty of an offense under division (B) of this
section, he or she may be punished as provided in §
10.99. In addition thereto, or in lieu thereof, a court may, without entering a
judgment of guilty, place that person under court supervision for any period
not exceeding one year. The supervision may include any of the conditions
provided for in division (C)(2) of this section, as the court determines
appropriate. If the person completes the period of supervision without
violating the conditions imposed by the court, the court shall discharge the
defendant from supervision and dismiss the charge against him or her. If the
person, while under court supervision, is convicted of, or pleads guilty or no
contest to, any criminal offense in any jurisdiction, and the state’s attorney
or the city prosecutor, as the case may be, moves for termination of
supervision, the court shall terminate the supervision and enter a judgment of
guilty on the plea or finding.
      (2)   The conditions of court supervision may require that the defendant:
         (a)   Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training;
         (b)   Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to exceed the
total of the actual loss or damage to the property and the actual pecuniary
loss, combined, or $2,500, whichever is less;

attend school; attend a nonresidential program for youth; or contribute to his
or her own support at home or in a foster home.
      (3)   When a court orders restitution or reparation as a condition for
court supervision, the court shall determine the amount and conditions of
payment. When the conditions of payment have not been satisfied, the court, at
any time prior to the expiration of termination of the period of court
supervision, may impose an additional period of not more than two years to make
restitution or reparation. Only the conditions of payment shall continue to
apply during the additional period. The court shall retain all of the incidents
of the original sentence, including the authority to modify or enlarge the
original conditions and to revoke the penalty of court supervision if the
conditions of payment are violated during the additional period.
      (4)   When the petition is filed charging a violation of a condition
imposed for court supervision, the court:
         (a)   May order a summons to the offender to appear, or order a
warrant for the offender’s arrest where there is danger of his or her fleeing
the jurisdiction or causing serious harm to others or when the offender fails
to answer a summons. The issuance of such a warrant or summons shall stay the
sentence of court supervision until the final determination of the charge, and
the term of court supervision shall not run so long as the offender has not
answered the summons or warrant;
         (b)   Shall conduct a hearing of the alleged violation. The court may
admit the offender to bail pending the hearing;

preponderance of the evidence;

conditions of a sentence which impose financial obligations upon the offender,
unless the failure is due to his or her willful refusal to pay; and/or
         (e)   May modify the conditions of court supervision on motion of the
city, on its own motion or at the request of the offender after notice to all
parties and a hearing.
      (5)   If the court finds that the offender has violated a condition at
any time prior to the expiration or termination of the period, it may continue
the offender on the existing period, with or without modifying or enlarging the
conditions, or may impose any other penalty that was available at the time of
the initial penalty.
      (6)   A judgment revoking a sentence of court supervision is a final
appealable order.
   (D)   Liability of parent or legal guardian of minor offender. The parent or
legal guardian of a minor defendant who resides with the parent or legal
guardian shall be liable for any fine or condition of restitution or reparation
imposed by a court upon a minor for a violation of this section, provided that
the minor has not paid the fine or made restitution or reparation within the
time ordered by the court, and provided, further, that the parent or legal
guardian has been served with a summons or notice to appear in the original
cause against the minor and all proceedings thereafter.

custody and shall make every reasonable effort to protect his or her health and

connection with the preparation of petitions, applications, certificates or
other documents for the apprehension, taking into protective custody,
transportation, examination, treatment, detention or discharge of an individual

prosecution of a person for the commission of any state or local offense when
the person was an underage person, the prosecutor, upon reasonable grounds to
so believe, may request a ruling as to whether the consumption of alcoholic
liquor, as permitted by the person’s parent, caused the commission of the
offense. If it is so determined in the affirmative, then divisions (A)(1) and
(2) of this section shall apply.

135.99

grading must meet the existing grades at the side and rear property lines.
      (2)   There shall be a drainage swale along the side yard that has a
slope of at least 1½%. A SWALE is defined as a shallow ditch with slide slopes
formed by the grading away from the building foundation. If a drainage swale is
not present, one must be constructed as part of the engineering improvements
for the lot. Unless permission is granted by an adjacent property owner, the
new swale shall be built entirely on the lot for which there has been an
application for a building permit.
      (3)   All yards shall have a design drainage pattern with a minimum slope
of 1½%.
      (4)   If the minimum slope requirements cannot be met for yards, drainage
inlets shall be constructed. The inlet(s) shall be connected to a public storm
sewer or outlet to a public drainage facility.
   (C)   Prior to the issuance of a building permit for a new single- or two-
family home or large room addition, as defined in §
151.002(B), the individual lot grading plan shall show the following
requirements unless otherwise waived by the City Engineer:
      (1)   There shall be dedicated public utility and drainage easements of
not less than ten feet in width for poles, wires, conduits, storm or sanitary
sewers, gas, cable TV, water or other utility pipes or lines along the rear of
each lot, and five feet alongside one interior side lot line where necessary.
The easements shall be laid out so that a proper continuity may be developed
for the utilities from lot to lot and block to block.
      (2)   Subject to the provisions of the city’s driveway regulations,
driveways may be permitted to encroach within any easement located within any
front or corner side yard building setback area parallel to the public right-
of-way or public street.
      (3)   No buildings, driveways or structures shall be constructed within
any interior side or rear lot line easements.
      (4)   At the city’s discretion, encroachments into a dedicated public
utility or any other easement granted to the city may be permitted for the
construction of buildings, driveways or structures including brick, stone or
masonry walls or fences; or structures which are wired for electricity, where:
         (a)   A written encroachment agreement approved by the City
Administrator is executed by the owner of the property; and/or
         (b)   A building permit for the proposed construction is issued by the
city’s Building Department. Those permits shall be issued only after approval
of complete plans for the construction by the Department of Public Works.
      (5)   At the city’s discretion, encroachments into a dedicated public
utility or any other easement granted to the city may be permitted for the
construction and installation of a fence that provides clearance in the
direction of flow for drainage of the width of the easement in the amount of
50% opaque to the height of 12 inches or 100% at a height of six inches,
provided a fence permit for the proposed construction is issued and all
required fees are paid to the city. Where any easement is designated for
drainage or storm water purposes, a fence permit shall be issued only after
approval by the Building Department.
      (6)   Any encroachment permitted by this section shall not be construed
as a waiver of any of the other requirements of this code, including, without
limitation, the zoning code, the subdivision regulations or the building codes.
      (7)   Under no circumstances shall the city be liable to any property
owner or third party for any damage to real or personal property or personal
injury that may result from or arise out of the construction of any
encroachment permitted by this section. The permitted encroachments shall be
subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The encroaching structure shall not abrogate or nullify the
city’s rights and interests in and to the easement of record;
         (b)   The property owners shall retain all of the risks and liability
associated with the encroaching structure on a dedicated public utility and
drainage easement or any other easement granted to the city, including, without
limitation, the risk that in an emergency the city may remove the encroaching
structure without any prior notice to the property owners;
         (c)   The property owners shall be solely responsible for the city’s
cost to remove the encroaching structure to gain access to any of its public
utilities in the easement for any purpose;
         (d)   The city shall not be responsible for any costs incurred by the
property owner to repair or replace the encroaching structure if it is damaged
or destroyed by the city for public utility purposes; and
         (e)   The property owners shall hold harmless, indemnify and defend
the city from and against any and all liability, claims, demands and causes of
action arising out of or related to any loss or injury, death, or loss or
damage to property resulting from the city’s use of any easement for any of its

§ 151.066 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city’s utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city’s residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this subchapter. This subchapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-
way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior
to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired
and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may
be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar
agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the city
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into an
agreement may request that the city enter into an agreement. In an agreement,
the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities. In the event that a utility provider has entered into a
franchise, license or similar agreement with the city, the franchise, license
or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of the franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of the agreement and
any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This subchapter supersedes all chapters
or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of the conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
subchapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this subchapter
to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or
regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this subchapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this subchapter when the city so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city
to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety
and welfare.

subchapter and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations, the
Director of Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.
In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed
under the application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Additional city review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to § 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220, Act 65,
§ 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the city that it intends to
commence work governed by this subchapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. The notice shall consist of plans, specifications,
and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose and intent of the
facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications retailer to the
city not less than ten days prior to the commencement of work requiring no
excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of work
requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall specify the portion of
the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide the
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either ten
days after service of notice to the city by the telecommunications retailer in
the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or 25 days after
service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may
commence work without obtaining a permit under this subchapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the city, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
151.069 of this subchapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
city an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. The
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
   (C)   Minimum general application requirements. The application shall be

§ 151.071 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on city rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this subchapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The meeting
shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing
special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including,
without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area
and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.
(Ord. 2007-10-0128O, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 151.072 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   (A)   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in
any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the city within 90 days after the
completion of the permitted work.
   (B)   The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the
locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the
permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of
this subchapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance
with §
151.086 of this subchapter.
   (C)   If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility
so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. 2007-10-0128O, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 151.073 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license or similar
agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in
the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance
policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the city, and its
elected and appointed officers, officials, agents and employees as additional
insureds on the policies listed in divisions (A)(1)(a) and (b) below:
         (a)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse and underground hazard (commonly referred to as
“X,” “C” and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
            1.   Five million dollars for bodily injury or death to each
person;
            2.   Five million dollars for property damage resulting from any
one accident; and
            3.   Five million dollars for all other types of liability.
         (b)    Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles
with a combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property
damage for each accident;
         (c)   Worker’s compensation with statutory limits; and
         (d)   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
      (2)   If the utility is not providing the insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then the contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis so that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover the loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the city within ten days following receipt
of a written request therefor from the city.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages.
      (1)   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
“It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until 30 days after receipt by the city,
by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written
notice addressed to the City Mayor of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
      (2)   Within ten days after receipt by the city of the notice, and in no
event later than ten days prior to the cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the city evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of division (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the city
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer” under
the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility’s liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the city and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. All insurance
carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated “A-” or better and of a class
size “X” or higher by A. M. Best Company.

§ 151.074 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend indemnify and hold the city and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether the acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited
by this subchapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided,
however, that the utility’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to
any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising
out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
subchapter by the city, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 2007-10-0128O, passed 10-9-2007)
§ 151.075 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this subchapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this subchapter;
and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this subchapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this subchapter to perform that the city must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to
this subchapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the city in the
form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this division
shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
city and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the city of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the
state at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform the restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days’ advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the city for the amount within the 14-day notice
period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter that the city
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
city that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee
shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division (C) of this
section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the city,
upon written request for the withdrawal to the city, provided that any
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or the portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
subchapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the
permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall
become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable
costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of the revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of the costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the city with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether
reserved by this subchapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to the Security Fund shall affect
any other right the city may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its
rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

for the revocation or suspension;
         (b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the city, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of the
correction to the city within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
         (c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above,
along, upon, under, across or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the city providing written proof of the removal
to the city within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
      (2)   The city may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the city may issue a stop work order immediately upon discovery
of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of this
section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the city or its
designee may, at the option of the city: correct the deficiencies; upon not
less than 20-days notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or
equipment; or after not less than 30-days notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the city. The
permittee shall be liable in all events to the city for all costs of removal.

   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the city no less than
30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-of-way
or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or the
facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former
owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations, including this subchapter, with respect to the work and facilities
in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the city’s right-of-
way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.

§ 151.080 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with public ways. No facilities shall be placed in
any location if the Director of Public Works determines that the proposed
location will require the relocation or displacement of any of the city’s
utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with use of the right-of- way by
the general public or the operation or maintenance of any of the city’s
facilities, or any other existing facilities. The city may require any
facilities causing such interference to be moved, as determined by the city
engineer.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the right-of-
way. Underground telecommunications facilities shall be installed within an
existing underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity exists within
such duct or conduit.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on the right-of way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of- way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
      (6)   Facilities to be located underground. All new facilities shall be
located underground unless not technically practicable.
      (7)   Whenever new telecommunication facilities will exhaust capacity of
a right-of-way or utility easement to reasonably accommodate future facilities,
a grantee may be required to provide additional ducts, conduits, manholes and
other facilities for non-discriminatory access to future grantees.
      (8)   No interference with drainage. No facility shall be placed in any
location that interferes with stormwater drainage, storage or conveyance or
blocks overland flow routes.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Wires, lines, or cable are located as near as practicable to the
right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable
pole alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of
the curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other underground locations are impracticable or inconsistent
with sound engineering judgment (such as, a new cable may be installed in
existing conduit without disrupting the pavement); and

      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and the installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   An applicant shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the

decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this subchapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Director of Public Works may
authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Director of Public Works may require the utility
requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or
may not be expressly contained within this subchapter but which carry out the

as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued for each collocation
approved in a consolidated application.
   (K)   Alternate locations. If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the city may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. The applicant
shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has the right to use
the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the alternate location
imposes technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the
applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location based on the
foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence in the form
of a written certification, under oath, describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate location
from being utilized.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The intent of this chapter is to avoid the following:
      (1)   Excessive quantities of soil eroding from areas that are undergoing
development for certain nonagricultural uses, including, but not limited to,
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants,
the building of roads and highways, the filling of land and the creation of
recreational facilities;
      (2)   The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangering the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing
vision and reducing traction of road vehicles;
      (3)   Soil erosion necessitating the costly repair of gulleys, washed-out
fills and embankments;
      (4)   Sediment from soil erosion tending to clog sewers and ditches and
to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs;
      (5)   Sedimentation limiting the use of water and waterways for the most
beneficial purposes and destroying fish and other aquatic life, and the costly
and difficult removal of sediment; and
      (6)   Sedimentation reducing the channel capacity of waterways, resulting
in greatly increased chances of flooding and grave danger to public health and
safety.
   (B)   The purposes of this chapter are to provide minimum standards to
safeguard persons, to protect property, to prevent the despoilation of the
environment and to promote the public welfare by regulating and controlling the
design, construction, quality of materials and use and maintenance of any
development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise
results in the movement of earth on land situated in the city.

substantially as stated or shown in the plan, they may stop further work until
approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to the existing
conditions.
      (3)   Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of approval of the City
Engineer and the Director, shall be maintained at the site during progress of
the grading.
      (4)   Until the final inspection is made, a sign issued by the city
indicating that permission to grade has been granted by the city shall be
prominently displayed on the front property line of the property involved so as
to be visible from the street on which the property fronts.
   (B)   In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following
schedule, the permittee shall notify the City Engineer and the Director at
least two full working days before the inspection is to be made:
      (1)   Rough grading. When all rough grading has been completed; and
      (2)   Final inspection. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures and required planting, has been completed.
(2000 Code, § 15.44.110)
§ 152.12 OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Compliance required. All earth moving grading and grading operations
not specifically exempted by this chapter shall comply with the applicable
standards and requirements set forth in this section, in addition to the other
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Handbook adopted by reference. The standards and specifications of the
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, Will-So. Cook County, Illinois, First
Edition, as compiled by the Will-So. Cook County Soil and Water Conservation
District and approved by the Seven County Regional Planning Commission, are
incorporated into this section and made a part of this section by this
reference for the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation
under development plans approved in §
152.06 above. In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of the
handbook and any of the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this
chapter shall control.
   (C)   Special precautions.
      (1)   If, at any stage of the grading, the City Engineer or the Director
of Public Works determines, by inspection, that the nature of the formation is
such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil
any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, he or she may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
safety precautions be taken as he or she considers advisable to avoid the
likelihood of the peril. Special precautions may include, but are not limited
to, specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, leveling or cribbing, installation of
plant materials for erosion control and reports of a registered engineering
geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work.
      (2)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading
is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, to install temporary structures or to
take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or
the public safety. On large operations, or where unusual site conditions
prevail, the City Engineer or the Director may specify the time of starting
grading and the time of completion or may require that the operation be
conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures
or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
   (D)   Expiration of permit. Every site development permit shall expire by
limitation and shall become null and void if the work authorized by the permit
has not been commenced within 180 days or is not completed within one year from
the date of issuance. However, the Mayor and Council may, if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work
being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable
extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of
the permit.
(2000 Code, § 15.44.120)
§ 152.13 EXCEPTIONS; APPEALS.
   (A)   Exceptions. The Mayor and Council may authorize exceptions to any of
the requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Application for exception. An application for an exception shall be
made by a verified petition of the applicant, stating fully the grounds of the
application and the facts relied upon by the petitioner. The petition shall be
filed with the site development permit application. In order for the land
referred to in the petition to come within the provisions of this section, it
shall be necessary that the Mayor and Council find all of the following facts
with respect thereto:
      (1)   The land is of such a shape or size, is affected by the physical
conditions or is subject to such title limitations of record that it is
impossible or impractical for the subdivider or property owner to comply with
all of the regulations of this chapter;
      (2)   The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the petitioner; and
      (3)   The granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the subject property.
   (C)   Referral of proposed exception. Each proposed exception shall be
referred to the City Engineer and the Director of Public Works and they shall
transmit to the Mayor and Council their recommendations, which recommendations
shall be reviewed prior to the granting of any exception.
   (D)   Appeals. After review thereon, the Mayor and Council, by resolution,
may approve the site development permit application with the exceptions and
conditions he, she or it deems necessary, may disapprove the site development
permit application and exception application or may take such other action as
is appropriate.
(2000 Code, § 15.44.130)
§ 152.14 REVOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   Authority. If any person holding a site development permit pursuant to
this chapter violates the terms of the permit, conducts or carries on the site
development in such a manner as to materially adversely affect the health,
welfare or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the
property of the permittee, or conducts or carries on such site development so
that it is materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to
property or improvements in the neighborhood, the Mayor and Council shall
revoke or suspend the site development permit.
   (B)   Procedure. No site development permit shall be permanently revoked or
suspended until a review is held by the Mayor and Council. Written notice of
the review shall be served upon the permittee, either personally or by
registered mail, and shall state:
      (1)   The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation or
suspension, in clear and concise language; and
      (2)   The time and place of the review.
   (C)   (1)   The notice shall be served by registered mail or personal
service on the permittee at least five days prior to the date set for the
review.
      (2)   At the review, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be
heard and he or she may call witnesses and present evidence on his or her
behalf. Upon conclusion of the review, the Mayor and Council shall determine
whether or not the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (D)   The Mayor and Council shall hold the hearing to consider a
recommendation for revocation or suspension of a permit which has been
temporarily suspended at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Mayor and
Council, at which all conditions of this division can be fulfilled.

existing tower provided:
         (a)   The height of the tower or structure on which the antenna is
placed is not increased;
         (b)   The applicant complies with the requirements of §§
156.27(B) and
156.28 of this chapter; and
         (c)   The owner provides prior written notice to the city of the
additional antennas.
   (B)   New towers. As conditions of approval of a new freestanding
conditional use tower in a residential district other than R5 or R6, or a new
tower in an R5, R6 or nonresidential district, the owner shall:
      (1)   Record the letter of intent required by this code, in the office of
the Recorder of Deeds for the county in which the tower site is located;
      (2)   Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for
information from a potential shared use applicant;
      (3)   Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties;
      (4)   Allow shared use where the third party seeking the use enters into
a written agreement to pay a reasonable, pro rata share of the costs of the
tower and all equipment buildings, including all charges necessary to modify,
but not totally reconstruct, the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared
use, and to avoid interference with the signals transmitted or received by the
tower’s users; and
      (5)   These conditions of approval shall be a covenant running with the
land and be binding on the current owner and all successors in interest of the
tower site.
   (C)   Where an owner whose tower was approved after the effective date of
this chapter wilfully and knowingly fails to comply with the requirements of
division (B), the city may withhold approval of any application by the owner
for a building permit, conditional use permit or variance for any tower or
antenna.
   (D)   Shared use shall not be precluded because a reasonable fee for shared
use is charged, or because reasonable costs may be incurred to adapt the
existing and proposed uses to a shared tower.
      (1)   The Director, the Planning and Zoning Commission or the City
Council may consider expert testimony to determine whether the anticipated fees
and costs are reasonable.
      (2)   Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.

and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of
surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise
utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in
order to accomplish the following specific purposes:
   (A)   To meet. the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, § 18(g), Rivers,
Lakes and Streams Act;
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations;
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 C.F.R. §§ 59 - 79, as amended;
   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.

2019)
§ 159.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A non-habitable structure which is on the same parcel
of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure.
   ACT. An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams
of the State of Illinois, ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §§ 5 et seq.
   APPLICANT. Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an
application.
   APPROPRIATE USE. Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible
and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed
are as specified in §
159.42.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year
frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location
is as defined in §
159.05.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The elevation in relation to mean sea level of
the crest of the base flood.
   BASEMENT. That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   BUILDING. A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, including manufactured homes,
prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also
includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more
than 180 days per year.
   CHANNEL. Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial
depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully,
ravine, wash, or natural or man-made drainageway, which has a definite bed and
banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either
perennially or intermittently and may have a dry bed from time to time.
   CHANNEL MODIFICATION. Alteration of a channel by changing the physical
dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION includes
damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening,
relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. CHANNEL MODIFICATION does not include the clearing of dead or dying
vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe form
of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross-
section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.
straightening).
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the special flood hazard area (see definition below)
used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill
or structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of
natural floodplain storage can increase off-site floodwater elevations and
flows.
   CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE. Preconstruction
approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This
preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the
property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to
permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon
review and acceptance of as-built plans.
   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A letter which indicates that
FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood
boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or
flood insurance rate map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved.
   CONTROL STRUCTURE. A structure designed to control the rate of flow that
passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water
surface elevation.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare
of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood
protection should be required  include: emergency services facilities (such as
fire and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care
facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone
switching stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage
facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples
of critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage
treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
   DAM. All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their
abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing
or diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
   DESIGNATED FLOODWAY. The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that
portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally
depicted on the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing
100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in
stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a 10%
increase in velocities.

§ 159.04 DUTIES OF CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
   The City Administrator or his designee shall be responsible for the general
administration and enforcement of this chapter, which shall include the
following:
   (A)   Determining the floodplain designation.
      (1)   Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a
special flood hazard area (SFHA).
      (2)   If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway,
flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been
conducted and which drains more than one square mile.
      (3)   Check whether the development is potentially within an extended
SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the
development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or
inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to
delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections
of this chapter.
   (B)   Professional engineer review.
      (1)   If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for
which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer
under the employ or contract of the city for review to ensure that the
development meets §§
159.40 through
159.62.
      (2)   In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E. shall state in writing
that the development meets the requirements of §§
159.40 through
159.42.
   (C)   Dam safety requirements.
      (1)   Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage
potential in the event of failure.
      (2)   The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard)
and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
      (3)   Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety
permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that
have an embankment are non-jurisdictional Class III dam. It is not required
that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all non-jurisdictional Class III dams.
      (4)   A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a
hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is
required.
      (5)   A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the
construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
      (6)   Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or
impoundment structures.
   (D)   Other permit requirements. Ensure any and all required federal, state
and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain
development permit.
   (E)   Plan review and permit issuance.
      (1)   Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the city meet the requirements of this chapter; and
      (2)   Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
   (F)   Inspection review.
      (1)   Assure that the city receives record drawings (paper and
electronic) for each project which are certified by a licensed professional
engineer; and
      (2)   Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and
document the results of the inspection.
   (G)   Damage determinations. Establish procedures for administering and
documenting determinations, as outlined below, of substantial improvement and
substantial damage made pursuant to §
159.06(C)(3).
      (1)   Determine the market value or require the applicant to obtain an
appraisal of the market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of
the building before the start of construction of the proposed work. In the case
of repair, the market value of the building shall be the market value before
the damage occurred and before any repairs are made.
      (2)   Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a
damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of
improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building.
      (3)   Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes
substantial improvement or substantial damage.
      (4)   Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance
with the flood resistant construction requirements of the village and this
chapter is required.
   (H)   Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain permit files
including:
      (1)   An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest
floor (including basement) of a residential or non-residential building subject
to §
159.06; and/or
      (2)   The elevation to which a non-residential building has been
floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to §
159.06.
   (I)   Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and
furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies
of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional
letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and
"as-built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all
buildings constructed subject to this chapter.
   (J)   State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted
by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to §§
159.40 through
159.62, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the city.
However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the city and shall
require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
      (1)   Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per the
Illinois Compiled Statutes;
      (2)   IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in §
159.02 and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects,
including projects of the city and county, except for those projects meeting
the requirements of §
159.42(A);
      (3)   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, per §
159.42(C)(5);
      (4)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to §
159.42(C)(4);

improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve
the administration of this chapter;
      (2)   Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a
regulatory map within six months whenever a modification of the floodplain may
change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map;
      (3)   Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance
Program; and
      (4)   Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter.
   (L)   Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary
to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to
the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any chapter changes.
   (M)   Variances. If a variance is to be granted, review the requirements of

§ 159.05 DETERMINATION OF BASE FLOOD ELEVATION.
   (A)   This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance
study for the city.
      (1)   If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is
not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other
sources, as approved by the city.
      (2)   When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall
submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better
data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to
any development of the site.
   (B)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs
shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance
study of Cook County prepared by FEMA dated November 1, 2019 and such
amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (C)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of
those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city shall be as
delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of Cook
County prepared by FEMA and dated November 1, 2019, and such amendments or
revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time.
   (D)   The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA
delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County panels
17031C0706J, 17031C0709J, 17031C0726J, 17031C0727J, 17031C0728J, 17031C0729J

into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (4)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer
lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted providing all
manholes or other above ground openings located below the FPE are watertight.
      (5)   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as
not to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages.
   (B)   Carrying capacity and notification.
      (1)   For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream
maintenance (including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse
shall be maintained.
      (2)   In addition, the city shall notify adjacent communities in writing
30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of
the watercourse.
   (C)   Protecting buildings.
      (1)   All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as a
SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection
elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway
shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in §§
159.40 through
159.42. This building protection criteria applies to the following situations:
         (a)   Construction or placement of a new building or alteration or
addition to an existing building valued at more than $1,000 or 70 square feet;
         (b)   Substantial improvements or structural alterations made to an
existing building that increase the floor area by more than 20% or equal or
exceed the market value by 50%. Alteration shall be figured cumulatively. If
substantially improved, the existing structure and the addition must meet the
flood protection standards of this section;
         (c)   Repairs made to a substantially damaged building. These repairs
shall be figured cumulatively. If substantially damaged the entire structure
must meet the flood protection standards of this section;

            1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than six inches
deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the
foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation;
            2.   The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection
elevation. However, the ten foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer
certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to
hydrostatic pressures;
            3.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during
flooding by vegetative cover, riprap or other structural measure;
            4.   The fill shall be composed of rock or soil and not incorporate
debris or refuse materials; and
            5.   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow or surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties, and when necessary, stormwater
management techniques such as swales or basins shall be incorporated.
      (3)   A residential or non-residential building may be elevated in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space,

from a flood, the top of the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above the
flood protection elevation.
            2.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, the manufactured
home shall be elevated so that either the top of the lowest floor is above the
base flood elevation or the chassis is at least 36 inches in height above grade
and supported by reinforced piers or other foundations of equivalent strength,
whichever is less.
         (f)   Recreational vehicles or travel trailers shall be required to
meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of this division (C)(3)(f) of
this section unless:
            1.   They are on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and
            2.   They are fully licensed, ready for highway use, and used only
for recreation, camping, travel or seasonal use rather than as a permanent
dwelling. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utility and service devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
      (4)   Only a non-residential building may be structurally dry
floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that:
         (a)   A licensed professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection
elevation, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and
capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood;
         (b)   The building design shall take into account flood velocities,
duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of
buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice; and
         (c)   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human
intervention and without an outside source of electricity (levees, berms,
floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose
of this division).
      (5)   A building may be constructed with a crawlspace located below the
flood protection elevation provided that the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
         (b)   Any enclosed area below the flood protection elevation shall
have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters. A minimum of one opening on each wall having a
total net area of not less than one square inch per one square foot of enclosed
area. The openings shall be no more than one foot above grade;
         (c)   The interior grade of the crawlspace below the flood protection
elevation must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior
grade;
         (d)   The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior
grade of the crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four
feet at any point;
         (e)   An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove
floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period
of time after a flood event;
         (f)   Portions of the building below the flood protection elevation
must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; and
         (g)   Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the
flood protection elevation.
      (6)   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet above the
level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
      (7)   Existing buildings located within a designated floodway shall also
meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in §§
159.40 through
159.42. Non-conforming structures located in a designated floodway may remain
in use and may only be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered in accordance
with §
159.42. A non-conforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other
natural or man-made disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50% of
its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform to this
chapter.
   (D)   Record drawings. For all developments in the SFHA, record drawings
shall be submitted to the City Administrator or his designee, before occupancy
permits will be issued. The record drawings shall be prepared by a registered
land surveyor or the licensed professional engineer who prepared the design
drawings. Three paper copies of these drawings, signed and sealed by the
surveyor or engineer, and one electronic copy, are required. Electronic files
shall be provided in Adobe Portable Document File ".pdf' formats.
   (E)   Timely construction. A development permit or approval shall become
invalid unless the start of construction, for work authorized by such permit,
is commenced within 180 days after its issuance, or if the work authorized is
suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 days after the work commences. All
permitted work shall be completed within (insert 12 months, 18 months or a
local permit expiration period) after the date of issuance of the permit or the
permit shall expire. Time extensions, of not more than 180 days each, may be
granted, in writing, by the City Administrator or his designee. Time extensions
shall be granted only if the original permit is compliant with this chapter and
the FIRM and FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted.

the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which has
not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development
located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically
connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The City Administrator or his designee shall maintain documentation
of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood
insurance rate map identification.
   (D)   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be
submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
   (E)   The City Administrator or his designee shall require certification

§ 159.27 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES IN FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health
and safety.
   (A)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and
obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing
the site from the floodplain.
   (B)   Compensatory storage.
      (1)   Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the
volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated
for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from
below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
      (2)   The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the

§ 159.28 CONSTRUCTION OF THE LOWEST FLOOR BELOW THE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)
IN FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that
removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill
to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the city to
construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood
fringe. The City Administrator or his designee shall not issue such a permit
unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the this
section.
   (A)   Compensatory storage shall be provided per §
159.27(B).
   (B)   The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window
wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE).
   (C)   The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the
FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the
structure.
   (D)   The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a
distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE.
   (E)   The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all
requirements of this section and is at least five feet thick under the basement
floor slab. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the removal
or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill
consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree
permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM
standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes.
   (F)   The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil
must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same
direction.
   (G)   All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and
inspected by an Illinois licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the
site conditions.
   (H)   The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five
below the BFE.
   (I)   There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and
minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be
provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the
estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the
building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor
under the effect of the seepage pressure.
   (J)   The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of
preventing backflow.
   (K)   All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic
pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
   (L)   In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no
case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot
exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The
rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if
necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly
to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain
the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.
   (M)   The builder and design engineer must certify that the design for the
development is reasonably safe from flooding in accordance with FEMA's
Technical Bulletin 10-01, and in accordance with accepted professional
practices.

§ 159.42 PREVENTING INCREASED DAMAGES; LIST OF APPROPRIATE USES.
   (A)   The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are
appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood
heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or
impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or
channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Adm.
Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed from anyone
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open
air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not block
flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
      (8)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
         (a)   The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will
not exceed 1.0 foot; or
         (b)   The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking
lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and
accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank
flooding events;
      (9)   Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slop toward a watercourse;
      (10)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure,
and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
      (11)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to 50% or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the
building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation; and
      (12)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building is improved to 50% or more of the market value before the modification
occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from
flooding to the flood protection elevation.
   (B)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or
channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in the
floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
appropriate use.
   (C)   Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use
will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the
following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with
supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and
provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of §
159.06:
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n"
is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te
Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, (McGraw-Hill, New York 1959)).
         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding.
         (a)   Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated
floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or
structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
         (b)   Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at
least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
         (c)   Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head
loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
         (d)   The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed
between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood
elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation.
All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
         (e)   If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location
of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate
through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that
the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
         (f)   There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result
of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce
flooding at existing structure.
      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights.
         (a)   For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-
stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the
average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events
up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
         (b)   In the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built
for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches.
         (a)   The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of
upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency
event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the
channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks)
such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or
within recorded flood easements.
         (b)   If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages
greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit
for a dam or waiver.
            1.   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
159.05. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA
approved hydraulic models.
            2.   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division (C)
(2) of this section.
            3.   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (C)(3) of
this section.
            4.   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used
for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.
            5.   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by this
section.
            6.   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per division (C)(8) of this section.
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and
approach roads.
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water.
         (a)   Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when
compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event, shall be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements.
         (b)   A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be
obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
         (c)   All dams and impoundment structures as defined in §
159.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
            1.   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
            2.   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning;
            3.   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin;
            4.   A non-point source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; and
            5.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §§
159.40 through
159.42.
      (7)   Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures.
         (a)   If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
         (b)   Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required
for floodproofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the floodway.
         (a)   When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert
openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and
culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate
uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
         (b)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used
unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the
same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length;
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length;
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used; and
            4.   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall
be demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment
of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable
if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and
fish and wildlife habitat;
         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
            1.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical;
            2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion;
            3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation;
            4.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel;
            5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives;
            6.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover;
            7.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate;
            8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality;
            9.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel;
            10.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project; and
            11.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
         (d)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of §§
159.40 through
159.42.
      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      (11)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of
improvements. Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to
denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within three days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within three days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade
but will remain undisturbed for longer than 21 days.
         (b)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off-site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
         (c)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see
division (C)(16) of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall
be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary,
to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be
restabilized immediately.
         (d)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 2002, or most recent
edition).
      (12)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      (13)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
159.05, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
         (b)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet:
            1.   The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency
flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and
            2.   Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water
elevations.
         (c)   If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      (14)   Conditional letter of map revision.
         (a)   If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the
applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and
documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision
and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway
change before a permit is issued.
         (b)   The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA
until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filing, grading, dredging,
or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR.
         (c)   In the case of non-government projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the
proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval
can be given.
         (d)   No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place
until a conditional approval is issued.
         (e)   After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
      (15)   Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional
engineer.
      (16)   For all activities in the floodway involving construction within
25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
      (17)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built"
plans.
   (D)   Development activities in delegated communities requiring state
review. For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and
concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county-delegated state permitting authority in the floodway.
      (1)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to division (C)(4) of this section.
      (2)   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to division (C)(5) of this section.

backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening.
      (6)   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles.
      (7)   Projects in public bodies of water.
   (E)   Other permits.
      (1)   In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a
development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless
the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is
not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §§ 5 et
seq.
      (2)   No correspondence from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the project
meets the requirements of Regional Permit 3.
      (3)   No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if IDNR/OWR has delegated
this responsibility to the city.
   (F)   Permits for dams.
      (1)   Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a
dam as defined in §
159.02 per 17 Ill. Adm. Code Part 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain an IDNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam.
      (2)   If the City Administrator or his designee finds a dam that does not
have an IDNR/OWR permit, the City Administrator or his designee shall
immediately notify the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office.
      (3)   If the City Administrator or his designee finds a dam which is
believed to be in unsafe condition, the City Administrator or his designee
shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR Bartlett office,
and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
   (G)   Activities that do not require a licensed professional engineer's
review. The activities in Regional Permit 3 may be permitted without a licensed
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements. Regional
