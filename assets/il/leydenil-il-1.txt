where less than four (4) competent readings exist, such estimate may be based
upon a lesser number of the four (4) preceding readings of such meter prior to
such incorrect or stopped registration. Where such readings shall be found
excessive or substantially deficient, the Superintendent is authorized to
establish a billing which shall be due and payable when billed. The

the Superintendent based upon the average of four (4) preceding readings of
such meter, excluding excessive or obviously substantial deficient readings.
Where such meter has been installed for less than one (1) year where less than
four (4) competent readings exist, such estimate may be based upon a lesser
number of the four (4) preceding readings of such meter prior to such
tampering. Where such readings shall be found excessive or substantially
deficient, the Superintendent is authorized to establish a billing which shall
be due and payable when billed. The Superintendent may also include a
reasonable charge for interest on unpaid sewer and water charges at a rate not
to exceed 5% per month.

and water service from that required by application of the appropriate charges
to actual meter readings, except as may be authorized in writing by the

user's bill, if the Superintendent determines that the actual meter readings
are excessive, the appropriate charges were not correctly applied to actual
meter readings, or the adjustments are otherwise appropriate in the
Superintendent's judgment.

be found that a user of the combined system is taking water service from
another utility system or source in violation of subsection 5-1-5 A. of this
title, a surcharge shall be imposed and charged to the user on all estimated
quantities of water that such user receives or previously received from such
other utility or source at the water user charge rate set forth in subsection

charitable, religious or beneficent purposes; or
         c.   The organization is unable to establish to the satisfaction of

for water and sewer use as a not for profit organization under this section
shall notify the township supervisor in writing within five (5) business days
of any change in its status under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code,
of any change in its use or occupancy of a building or property that is

event that disqualifies the organization from receiving sewer and water service
from the township at the municipal rate provided in subsection A3 of this
section.

cooperation.

persons described above to the extent that insurance coverage is available to
defend and indemnify such present or former officers, agents or employees.
Nothing contained herein is intended or shall be construed to waive, release or

policy of the State. To the extent insurance coverage is unavailable, the Town
may decline to defend and indemnify present or former officers, agents or
employees against claims or actions based on reckless, wilful or intentional
violations of clearly established duties or rights; however, the Town shall, to
the extent insurance coverage is unavailable, indemnify such persons for their
court costs in successfully defending such claims or actions.

such regular or special meeting in the absence of the Supervisor. (1992 Code;
amd. Ord. TO-2022-15, 10-11-2022)
1-5-4: PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TOWN BOARD:
   Robert’s Rules of Order shall govern the proceedings of the Town Board where
applicable and when not in conflict with federal or Illinois statutes or this
Code; provided, however, the Town Board may adopt rules of order revising,
repealing, amending, suspending, supplementing or supplanting, in whole or in
part, Robert’s Rules of Order.
   A.   Public Participation Rules at Meetings of the Town Board:
      1.   Purpose. The Town Board encourages public participation at its
meetings. All regular and special meetings are conducted in compliance with the
Illinois Open Meetings Act, and are therefore open for public observation.
Pursuant to Sections 2.05 and 2.06(g) of the Illinois Open Meetings Act (5 ILCS
120/2.05 and 120/2.06(g), respectively), the Town Board establishes the
following Rules to govern public comment and recording of meetings during
regular and special Board meetings.
      2.   Rules:
         a.   Public comments are permitted during the Public Comments segments
of regular and special Board meetings as noted on the agendas of such meetings.
         b.   Public comments shall be limited to a total of five (5) minutes
per person unless the Supervisor grants additional time as needed and within
reasonable time limits.
         c.   Persons wishing to speak must be present at the meeting. Public
comment by use of any telecommunication device, unless otherwise provided by
the Illinois Open Meetings Act, will not be permitted except in the case of
individuals with disabilities that prevent them from attending in person.
Individuals who cannot attend due to disability or who require disability
related accommodations to allow them to observe and/or participate are
requested to contact the Town Clerk in advance, if possible, to allow the
Township to arrange reasonable accommodations, if feasible.
         d.   If a group with similar views on an issue wishes to speak during
the public comment period, the Board requests that a spokesperson be selected
to address the Board. Redundancy and repetition does not facilitate an orderly
and efficient meeting. If additional matters are to be presented by any other
members of the group, the Supervisor may limit the number of such persons and
limit the presentation to information not already presented by the group’s
spokesperson.
         e.   At the beginning of the Public Comments segment of the meeting,
the Supervisor will ask if anyone wishes to address the Board and will
determine the order in which speakers will be recognized. No person shall
address the Board without first being recognized by the Supervisor.
         f.   Each person desiring to address the Board shall first state his/
her name for the record, state the subject, and state whom he/she is
representing if he/she represents an organization or other persons.
         g.   An individual will not be allowed to speak a second time until
the Board has heard from all members of the public who wish to speak and only
upon the majority vote of the Board.
         h.   Public comments must pertain to an item on the agenda or to an
issue/matter relating to the Township. The Supervisor retains the right to stop
any speaker who raises issues that are not on the agenda or are not germane to
the Township.
         i.   Public comment is not intended to require Board members or
Township staff to provide any answer to the speaker. Discussions between
speakers and members of the audience will not be allowed. The Board will not
necessarily respond to comment provided at the public meeting at the same time
comment is given. Consideration will be given to the public comment and further
research may be required before the Board takes any action regarding the public
comment. Although questions may be asked of a Board member or a member of the
Township’s staff, those individuals may decline to answer when a complete
answer requires research or deliberate consideration.
         j.   Comments shall be presented in a respectful manner, and
participants shall conduct themselves in an orderly and civil manner which
displays mutual respect. Use of profanity, inappropriate language, innuendos,
or other offensive actions and gestures shall not be permitted.
         k.   Public comments are not a forum to be used by political
candidates to advance their candidacy for any public office.
         l.   The Board reserves the right to remove anyone who becomes
hostile, argumentative, threatens the public’s or an individual’s safety or is
disruptive to the meeting. If the party being asked to leave does not
voluntarily leave or cease the behavior, law enforcement will be called to
remove the person.
         m.   Questions regarding specific elected officials, officers, agents
or employees of the Township will not be entertained. Questions of this type
may be addressed, in writing, to the Supervisor, who shall determine the
appropriate method of response.
         n.   Members of the audience will not engage in conversation while the
meeting of the Town Board is in session.
         o.   Members of the audience will not be permitted free movement about
the meeting room while the meeting of the Town Board is in session. Members of
the audience may enter and leave the board room at any time, provided such
entrance or exit is made quietly and in an orderly fashion.
         p.   Individuals who appear to be visibly intoxicated shall not be
allowed to attend a Town Board meeting or address the Town Board.
         q.   The consumption of any solid or liquid food or the smoking of any
tobacco product or consumption of cannabis is prohibited at any meeting of the
Town Board.
   B.   Recording Meetings:
      1.   Cameras. Cameras, including still cameras, move cameras, and
television cameras, using flashlights or lighting equipment other than the
normal light furnished in the board room, will not be allowed while meetings of
the Town Board are in session unless otherwise permitted by the Supervisor.
      2.   Battery operated recording equipment is permitted, provided the
operation thereof is silent. The microphone or pick up shall not be placed in
the section of the board room designated for the Town Board unless otherwise
permitted by the Supervisor.
      3.   No equipment may be set up or used in any manner so as to obstruct
the view of any person in the audience.
   C.   The Supervisor or his/her designee shall be responsible for the
enforcement of the provisions of this Section and shall be empowered to
reprimand and/or eject any and all persons violating the provisions of this
Section. (1992 Code; amd. Ord. 2019-5, 5-14-2019; Ord. TO-2022-7, 5-10-2022)

1-5-6: PERSONNEL POLICIES:
   The board may adopt, amend or repeal such employment policies or guidelines
as it may deem appropriate to promote efficiency and economy in operation of
the township government and to maintain and stimulate high morale among
township employees. However, such policies or guidelines are a statement of
current intent only and, unless expressly provided otherwise, shall not be

organization; and evidence that any applicable apprenticeship program has
graduated at least five (5) apprentices in each of the past five (5) years for
each of the construction crafts the bidder will perform on the project.
Evidence of graduation rates are not required for apprenticeable crafts
dedicated exclusively to the transportation of material and equipment to and

limited to: a copy of all applicable apprenticeship standards and
Apprenticeship Agreement(s) for any apprentice(s) who will perform work on the
public works project; documentation from each applicable apprenticeship program

safety program will be allowed to participate on the project. The bidder must
have copies of the employee OSHA cards on file, and the Town may request the
bidder provide copies of employee's OSHA cards; failure to produce an

documentation to the Town prior to the subcontractor commencing work on the
project.
      15.   Disclosure of any determinations by a court or governmental agency
for violations of federal, state, or local laws, including but not limited to
serious, willful, or repeated violations of the Occupations Safety and Health
Act (OSHA), violations of contracting or antitrust laws, tax or licensing laws,
environmental laws, or the Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts.
      16.   Statements as to past performance, which shall give an accurate and
complete record of all public works projects completed in the past three (3)
years by the contractor. Such statements shall include the name of the public

of all subcontractors used, if applicable, and a statement as to compliance
with completion deadlines.
      Upon designation by the Town that a contractor's or subcontractor's
submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and upon any
further consideration deemed necessary by the Town, the contractor or
subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future Town public works projects. A
contractor's classification as "qualified" shall exempt the contractor or sub-
contractor from the comprehensive submission requirements for a period of
twelve (12) months. Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are pre-
qualified must submit a complete application for continuation of "pre-
qualified" standing, on a form provided by the Town (also referred to as the
"short form") by December 31 for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any
pre-qualified contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete
application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing shall result in
automatic removal of the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year.
However, the "removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to
bid on Town public works projects. The pre-qualification designation is solely
within the discretion of the Town and the Town specifically reserves the right
to change or revoke the designation for a stated written reason(s). Denial of
pre-qualification shall be in writing and shall be forwarded to the contractor
within seven (7) working days of such decision. Any contractor denied or losing
pre-qualification status may request reconsideration of the decision by
submitting such request in writing to the Town Supervisor within five (5)
business days of receipt of notice of denial.
      All material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within fourteen (14) days of its occurrence. Failure to
comply with this requirement is grounds for the contractor to be deemed a non-
responsible bidder.
      For the purpose of this subsection, the term "public works" shall have
the same meaning as the definition of "Public works" provided by the Illinois
Prevailing Wage Act as may be amended from time-to-time.
   D.   Incomplete Submissions. It is the bidder's sole responsibility to
comply with all submission requirements at the time it submits its bid to the
Town. Bidder submissions deemed inadequate or incomplete may result in a
determination that the bidder in not a responsible bidder. The submission
requirements also apply to all subcontractors, except that the successful
bidder shall submit all subcontractor submissions to the Town prior to the
subcontractor commencing work on the project. Failure of a subcontractor to
submit the required information shall not disqualify the successful bidder from
performing work on the project and shall not constitute a contractual default
and/or breach by the successful bidder. However, the Town may withhold all
payments otherwise due for work performed by a subcontractor until the
subcontractor submits the required submission to the Town. If a subcontractor
fails to submit the required information, the Town may require that the
successful bidder remove the subcontractor from the project and replace it with
a responsive and responsible contractor.
   E.   Rejection Of Bids: The board of trustees has exclusive responsibility
and discretion to reject any or all bids.
   F.   Performance And Payment Bonds: Whenever required by the terms of the
bid or by state law, successful bidders shall be required to submit performance
and payment bonds with sufficient sureties to ensure performance of the
contract and to save the town harmless from the wage and material payment
claims of laborers, subcontractors and material men.
   G.   Assignment Of Contracts: No contract shall be assignable or sublet by
the successful bidder without the written consent of the board of trustees.
   H.   Competitive Bidding Exception: Contracts which by their nature are not
adapted to award by competitive bidding, such as contracts for the services of
individuals possessing a high degree of professional skill where the ability or
fitness of the individual plays an important part and contracts for utility
service such as water, electricity, gas or telephone, shall not be subject to
the competitive bidding requirements of this chapter.
   I.   Emergency Contracts: In case of an emergency, the Board of Trustees may
authorize purchase orders or contracts for services, materials, equipment or
supplies reasonably required to address the emergency without advertising for
bids.
   J.   Budget Approval: No purchase orders or contracts shall be approved or
awarded unless funds are budgeted and available in excess of all unpaid
obligations to pay the amount to be obligated thereby.
   K.   Encumbrance Of Funds: All financial obligations incurred by a purchase
order or contract shall be recorded in the town's budget accounting system and
shall be an encumbrance on funds then budgeted and available to pay the amount
obligated.

      11.   Documentation evidencing the bidder actively participates, and has

bid opening, in apprenticeship training programs applicable to the work to be
performed on the project, which are approved by and registered with the United
States Department of Labor's Office of Apprenticeship, or its successor
organization; and evidence that any applicable apprenticeship program has
graduated at least five (5) apprentices in each of the past five (5) years for
each of the construction crafts the bidder will perform on the project.
Evidence of graduation rates are not required for apprenticeable crafts
dedicated exclusively to the transportation of material and equipment to and
from the public works project. The required evidence includes, but is not
limited to: a copy of all applicable apprenticeship standards and
Apprenticeship Agreement(s) for any apprentice(s) who will perform work on the
public works project; documentation from each applicable apprenticeship program
certifying that it has graduated at least five (5) apprentices in each of the
past five (5) years for each construction craft the bidder will perform on the
project; and additional evidence of participation and graduation requirements
as may be requested by the Highway Commissioner at its discretion.
      12.   Bidder shall certify that all employees expected to perform work on
the project have completed a ten (10)-hour or greater OSHA safety program. Only
workers that have satisfactorily completed a ten (10)-hour or greater OSHA
safety program will be allowed to participate on the project. The bidder must
have copies of the employee OSHA cards on file, and the Highway Commissioner
may request the bidder provide copies of employee's OSHA cards; failure to
produce an employee's OSHA card may result in a determination that the bidder
is not a responsible bidder.
      13.   All contractors and sub-contractors are required to turn in
certified payrolls pursuant to Illinois Prevailing Wage Act, and comply with
all provisions of the Employee Classification Act, 820 ILCS 185/1, et seq.
      14.   Documentation of the name and address of each subcontractor from
whom the contractor has accepted a bid and/or intends to hire on any part of
the project. Further, each such subcontractor shall be required to adhere to
the requirements as though it were bidding directly to the Highway
Commissioner. Each contractor shall submit all subcontractor information and
supporting documentation to the Highway Commissioner prior to the subcontractor
commencing work on the project.
      15.   Disclosure of any determinations by a court or governmental agency
for violations of federal, state, or local laws, including but not limited to
serious, willful, or repeated violations of the Occupations Safety and Health
Act (OSHA), violations of contracting or antitrust laws, tax or licensing laws,
environmental laws, or the Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts.
      16.   Statements as to past performance, which shall give an accurate and
complete record of all public works projects completed in the past three (3)
years by the contractor. Such statements shall include the name of the public
body and the project, original contract price, final contract price, the names
of all subcontractors used, if applicable, and a statement as to compliance
with completion deadlines.
      Upon designation by the Highway Commissioner that a contractor's or
subcontractor's submission in anticipation of a bid is complete and timely, and
upon any further consideration deemed necessary by the Highway Commissioner,
the contractor or subcontractor may be pre-qualified for future Highway
Commissioner public works projects. A contractor's classification as
"qualified" shall exempt the contractor or sub-contractor from the
comprehensive submission requirements for a period of twelve (12) months.
Thereafter, contractors or subcontractors who are prequalified must submit a
complete application for continuation of "pre-qualified" standing, on a form
provided by the Highway Commissioner (also referred to as the "short form") by
December 31 for the upcoming calendar year. Failure by any pre-qualified
contractor or subcontractor to timely submit its complete application for
continuation of "pre-qualified" standing shall result in automatic removal of
the designation, effective January 1 of the upcoming year. However, the
"removed" contractor or subcontractor shall still be permitted to bid on
Highway Commissioner public works projects. The pre-qualification designation
is solely within the discretion of the Highway Commissioner and the Highway
Commissioner specifically reserves the right to change or revoke the
designation for a stated written reason(s). Denial of pre-qualification shall
be in writing and shall be forwarded to the contractor within seven (7) working
days of such decision. Any contractor denied or losing pre-qualification status
may request reconsideration of the decision by submitting such request in
writing to the Highway Commissioner within five (5) business days of receipt of
notice of denial.
         All material changes to the contractor's status, at any time, must be
reported in writing within fourteen (14) days of its occurrence. Failure to
comply with this requirement is grounds for the contractor to be deemed a non-
responsible bidder.
         For the purpose of this subsection, the term "public works" shall have
the same meaning as the definition of "Public works" provided by the Illinois
Prevailing Wage Act as may be amended from time-to-time.
   H.   Incomplete Submissions. It is the bidder's sole responsibility to
comply with all submission requirements at the time it submits its bid to the
Highway Commissioner. Bidder submissions deemed inadequate or incomplete may
result in a determination that the bidder is not a responsible bidder. The
submission requirements also apply to all subcontractors, except that the
successful bidder shall submit all subcontractor submissions to the Highway
Commissioner prior to the subcontractor commencing work on the project. Failure
of a subcontractor to submit the required information shall not disqualify the
successful bidder from performing work on the project and shall not constitute
a contractual default and/or breach by the successful bidder. However, the
Highway Commissioner may withhold all payments otherwise due for work performed
by a subcontractor until the subcontractor submits the required submission to
the Highway Commissioner. If a subcontractor fails to submit the required
information, the Highway Commissioner may require that the successful bidder
remove the subcontractor from the project and replace it with a responsive and
responsible contractor.
   I.   Rejection Of Bids: The Highway Commissioner has exclusive
responsibility and discretion to reject any or all bids.
   J.   Performance And Payment Bonds: Whenever required by the terms of the
bid or by state law, successful bidders shall be required to submit performance
and payment bonds with sufficient sureties to ensure performance of the
contract and to save the Leyden Township Road District and the Town harmless
from the wage and material payment claims of laborers, subcontractors and
material men.
   K.   Assignment Of Contracts: No contract shall be assignable or sublet by
the successful bidder without the written consent of the Board of Trustees.

conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of Leyden
Township's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way
or public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize Leyden Township's residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.

facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Township
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Township enter into such an agreement. In such
an agreement, the Township may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent
with this chapter.

or parts of ordinances adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith to
the extent of such conflict.
   G.   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
Federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this

maximum extent possible without violating Federal or State laws or regulations.
   H.   Sound Engineering Judgment: The Township shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the Township so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the

that it intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for
the provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Township not less than ten (10) days prior
to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Highway
Commissioner shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the Highway Commissioner fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either: a)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the Township by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this chapter. For purposes of determining when the ten (10) or twenty five (25)
day period specified in this subsection begins, service of notice to the
Township shall be considered to have occurred on the date that the Township has
received all of the documentation required to be submitted under subsection B1
of this section.
      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Township, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to section
4-6-4 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Township an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection A of this
section.

4-6-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the Township authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on Township rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   B.   Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless the construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   C.   Pre-Construction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be
held at a date, time and place designated by the Township with such Township
representatives in attendance as the Township deems necessary. The meeting
shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit and special
considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without
limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and
their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
Township does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements
of the Township and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Township within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section
4-6-21 of this chapter. If the Township denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-8: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Township, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
subsections A1 and A2 of this section:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to

      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
      If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the Township within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the Township. In lieu of a
copy of the policy, a certificate indicating that the insurance policies
required by this section have been obtained and are in force, may be submitted
with the approval of the Highway Commissioner.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:

the intention not to renew be stated until ten (10) days after receipt by the
Township, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the Township's Highway Commissioner of such intent
to cancel or not to renew.
   Within seven (7) days after receipt by the Township of said notice, and in
no event later than three (3) days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the Township evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the Township evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private
self-insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the Township and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the utility in the State of Illinois.

and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, and costs
of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of
or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the Township, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Township occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Township issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Township may pay or incur by reason of any action
or non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform, that the Township must perform itself, or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Township from the permittee pursuant
to this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Township in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Township, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Township. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Township and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Township of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, or DuPage
Counties, Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Township, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the Township estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Township, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Township may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection C for any single phase. The Security Fund for each
construction project will be ten dollars ($10.00) per linear foot of the
project, or the company may post a yearly cash retainer or letter of credit for
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) (replenished yearly), or a bond for an
amount determined by the Township, for all construction work to be undertaken
that year.
   D.   Withdrawals: The Township, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written
notice stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided
that the permittee has not reimbursed the Township for such amount within the
fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Township for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Township has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Township
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   E.   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Township that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the
Township, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Township, provided
that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Township for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Township to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Township as a result of said revocation,
provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
   H.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Township with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Township, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Township may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Township shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to
any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. SWO-2018-
6, 8-14-2018)

to comply with the provisions of subsection C of this section, the Township or
its designee may, at the option of the Township: 1) correct the deficiencies;
2) upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days'
notice to the permittee of failure to cure the non- compliance, deem them
abandoned and property of the Township. The permittee shall be liable in all
events to the Township for all costs of removal. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)

      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   C.   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The Township retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the Township, as the Township may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the Municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights-of-way of the Township, the utility shall notify the Township
within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the Township may
direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Township
Engineer and/or Highway Commissioner determines that such removal will be in
the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that
the Township does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove
it, by giving notice of abandonment to the Township, the abandoning utility
shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion
of the facility by another utility or person. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
   Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the
utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain
within ten (10) days, and to the satisfaction of the Township. This includes
restoration of all disturbed areas. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be
made using materials and methods approved by the Township Engineer and/or
Highway Commissioner. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to
restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which
existed prior to the commencement of the project. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)

   A.   General: Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the Township and at the utility's expense.
   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the roadway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, immediately, notify the Cook
County Sheriff's Department of the situation. This notification shall include a
description of the problem, work being undertaken, and what steps have been
taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make
the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the Cook County Sheriff's Department shall
be notified immediately.

Commissioner as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify
each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the
reasons why a variance should be granted.
   B.   Authority To Grant Variances: The Township Board shall decide whether a
variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   C.   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Township Board may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as
terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship
that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   D.   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Township Board may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this chapter. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-22: RIGHT TO APPEAL:

including denial of a variance, made by the Highway Commissioner under the
provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the Township
Administrator. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Township Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order,
requirement, decision or determination. The Township Administrator shall timely
decide the appeal. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-23: PENALTIES:
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Township
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Township's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a
permit related cost appointment of the Township. Sanctions may be imposed upon
a utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-
2018)
4-6-24: ENFORCEMENT:
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Township may have for enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. SWO-2018-6, 8-14-2018)
4-6-25: SEVERABILITY:
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and

be the charge per quarter or month levied on all users of the combined system.
The combined system service charge shall consist of a wastewater service charge
for use of the wastewater facilities, water service charge for the use of the
water facilities, plus a debt service charge.
   The combined system charge, wastewater service charge, water service charge
and debt service charge shall be set in accordance with the formulas contained
in section
5-4-3 of this chapter and shall be set in amounts sufficient to produce
revenues to pay the costs of operation and maintenance of the combined system,
to provide an adequate depreciation reserve and to pay the debt service of the
combined system, which debt service shall include the principal, interest and
coverage of all outstanding bonds of the combined system.
   B.   Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service charge shall consist
of the total of the basic sewer user charge and, where applicable, the capital
improvement charge and a surcharge.
   C.   Water Service Charge: The water service charge shall consist of the
total of the basic water user charge and, where applicable, the capital
improvement charge. (Ord. SW-O-89-1, 8-8-1989)

sufficient to pay the principal of an interest upon the outstanding revenue
bonds, if any, as may be authorized and issued by ordinance of the town board
from time to time. (Ord. SWO-96-3, 11-4-1996)
5-4-2: BASIS FOR SEWER SERVICE CHARGES:
   A.   Sewer Users Served By Combined System Water Meters: There is hereby
levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having
a connection with the wastewater collection system and being served with water
solely by the combined system a sewer service charge based, in part, on the
quantity of water used, as measured by the water meter used upon the premises.
   B.   Sewer Users Served By Private Wells: If any person discharging
wastewater into the public sanitary sewers procures any part or all of their
water from sources other than the combined system, all or part of which is
discharged into the sanitary sewers, the person shall have water meters
installed, if required by the combined system, at the person’s expense for the
purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these sources. Where
sewer meters are already installed, new water meters will not be required. The
water meters shall be furnished by the combined system and installed under its
supervision, all costs being at the expense of the person requiring the meter.
The combined system will charge for each meter a rental charge set by the
combined system to compensate for the cost of furnishing and serving the meter.
The rental charge shall be billed at the time the sewer service charge is
billed.
   C.   Deduct Meters: If a user feels that a significant amount of metered
water does not reach the sanitary sewer, the user may choose of one of the
following options:
      1.   The user may request the approving authority to have such additional
meters or metered services installed as are necessary to calculate the volume
of water not discharged to the sanitary sewer (i.e., a “deduct” meter), or the
user may request the approving authority to have a meter installed to measure
the actual amount of sewage discharged to the sanitary sewer (i.e., a “sewage”
meter). Requests for a second meter or metered services must be made, in
writing, to the superintendent. In the event the approving authority agrees to
such installations, the customer shall be charged all costs attendant thereto,
including, but not limited to, a meter yoke for each meter (to be installed by
a licensed plumber), meter rental (the meter shall be owned by the combined
system and shall be subject to access and inspection by the Superintendent and
an authorized representatives at all reasonable times) in an amount set
annually by the approving authority, remote reading device(s) if necessary and
labor and miscellaneous parts and supplies. No provision shall be made, nor
shall any means be taken, to route water from any “deduct” meter to the
customer’s general distribution system. In addition to the general penalties
set forth in Chapter 1 of this Title, any violation of this subsection will
result in nullification of the deduct readings and removal of the deduct water.
      2.   In the event it is physically impractical or impossible to install
metering equipment, the user may request the approving authority to take such
means as it deems necessary to formulate an estimate of the amount of water not
being discharged into the sanitary sewerage system or, conversely, the amount
of actual sewage discharged thereto.
Neither of the options set forth in this subsection shall be applicable or
available to customers for “reasons” which are attendant to use of water for
the filling of pools or watering of lawns and outdoor greenery.
   D.   Basis For Wastewater Service Charges: The wastewater service charge for
the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the Town
shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance.
      1.   The basic sewer user charge shall be based on water usage as
recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following
normal domestic concentrations:
         a.   A five (5) day, twenty degree Celsius (20 C) biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) of two hundred fifty milligrams per liter (250 mg/l).
         b.   A suspended solids (SS) content of two hundred fifty milligrams
per liter (250 mg/l).
         c.   An ammonia nitrogen concentration of sixteen milligrams per liter
(16 mg/l).
      2.   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement
and shall be computed as follows:
         a.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS, pounds of BOD, pounds
of ammonia nitrogen.
         b.   Estimate the number of sewer users.
         c.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund for the year,
for all work categories.
         d.   Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement
(OM&R) costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids,
BOD, ammonia nitrogen and fixed costs.
         e.   Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons for normal sewage
strength.
         f.   Compute surcharge costs per pound per one thousand (1,000)
gallons in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS.
         g.   Compute fixed charge by dividing the total fixed costs by the
number of users.
   E.   Reassignment Of Sewer Users: The approving authority will reassign
sewer users into appropriate sewer service charge categories if wastewater
sampling programs or other related information indicate a change of categories
is necessary.

      1.   Permit Requirements: No person in the business of gathering and
disposing of septic tank sludge or holding tank sewage shall transfer such
material into any disposal area or public sewer, unless a written permit for
disposal has been first obtained from the Superintendent and the MWRD. Written
application for this permit shall be made to the Superintendent and shall state
the name and address of the applicant, the number of its disposal units and the
make, model and license number of each unit. Permits shall be nontransferable
except in the case of replacement of the disposal unit for which a permit shall
have been originally issued. The permit may be obtained upon payment of a fee
of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per calendar year. The time and place of
disposal will be designated by the approving authority. The approving authority
may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any permit granted.
The approving authority may impose such conditions as it deems necessary on any
permit granted.

   K.   Estimated Charges; Interest On Unpaid Bills:
      1.   In cases where it shall be found that a water or sewer meter has
registered incorrectly or has stopped as a result of malfunctioning equipment,
the charges and payments for sewer and water services shall be made on an
estimate prepared by the Superintendent based upon the average of four (4)
preceding readings of such meter, excluding excessive or obviously substantial
deficient readings. Where such meter has been installed for less than one (1)
year or where less than four (4) competent readings exist, such estimate may be
based upon a lesser number of the four (4) preceding readings of such meter
prior to such incorrect or stopped registration. Where such readings shall be
found excessive or substantially deficient, the Superintendent is authorized to
establish a billing which shall be due and payable when billed. The
Superintendent may also include a reasonable charge for interest on unpaid
sewer and water charges at a rate not to exceed one and five-tenths percent
(1.5%) per month.
      2.   Estimated Charges; Interest On Unpaid Bills: In cases where it shall
be found that a water or sewer meter has been tampered with or where any
instrument, device or apparatus has been installed that causes diversion,
interference, or inaccurate measurement of utility services, the charges and
payments for sewer and water services shall be made on an estimate prepared by
the Superintendent based upon the average of four (4) preceding readings of
such meter, excluding excessive or obviously substantial deficient readings.
Where such meter has been installed for less than one (1) year where less than
four (4) competent readings exist, such estimate may be based upon a lesser
number of the four (4) preceding readings of such meter prior to such
tampering. Where such readings shall be found excessive or substantially
deficient, the Superintendent is authorized to establish a billing which shall
be due and payable when billed. The Superintendent may also include a
reasonable charge for interest on unpaid sewer and water charges at a rate not
to exceed five percent (5%) per month.
   L.   Adjustments: No Town employee is authorized to adjust bills for sewer
and water service from that required by application of the appropriate charges
to actual meter readings, except as may be authorized in writing by the
Superintendent. The Superintendent may, in writing, authorize adjustments to a
user's bill, if the Superintendent determines that the actual meter readings
are excessive, the appropriate charges were not correctly applied to actual
meter readings, or the adjustments are otherwise appropriate in the
Superintendent's judgment.
   M.   Water Surcharge; Exclusive Service Violations: In cases where it shall
be found that a user of the combined system is taking water service from
another utility system or source in violation of subsection
5-1-5 A. of this title, a surcharge shall be imposed and charged to the user on
all estimated quantities of water that such user receives or previously
received from such other utility or source at the water user charge rate set
forth in subsection B.1. of this section.
   N.   Changes In Status Of Not For Profit Customers:
      1.   All not for profit organizations that desire to be charged for sewer
and water service at the municipal rate provided in this section shall submit a
written application and any supporting material required by the township to
establish to the satisfaction of the township that: a) the buildings or
properties occupied by the applicant are actually and exclusively used for
charitable, religious or beneficent purposes, and b) that the applicant is a
qualified organization under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code.
      2.   All buildings, properties and customers that are classified as not
for profit organizations and uses and that are charged at the municipal rate
shall be reclassified as commercial customers and charged at the commercial
rate for water and sewer use at such time as:
         a.   The customer loses its 501(c) status;
         b.   The building or property is no longer used exclusively for
charitable, religious or beneficent purposes; or
         c.   The organization is unable to establish to the satisfaction of
the township that it is entitled to be charged at the municipal rate for water
and sewer use as provided under subsection A3 of this section.
      3.   Any organization that has applied and received the municipal rate
for water and sewer use as a not for profit organization under this section
shall notify the township supervisor in writing within five (5) business days
of any change in its status under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code,
of any change in its use or occupancy of a building or property that is
receiving water charged at the municipal rate, or of any other circumstance or
event that disqualifies the organization from receiving sewer and water service
from the township at the municipal rate provided in subsection A3 of this
section.
      4.   Failure of a water customer to give written notice to the township
as required under subsection N3 of this section is a violation of this section
which shall result in an enforcement surcharge of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) being added to the customer's current account, in addition to any
other fees or charges that may be due from the customer. An adjusted water bill
shall be issued to the customer charging the customer the difference between
the commercial rate and the municipal rate for customer's water and sewer use
for the period of time that the customer was not eligible to be charged at the
municipal rate for water and sewer use, together with interest at the rate of
one and one-half percent (1.5%) for each month, or part of a month, that the
customer was disqualified from receiving sewer and water service at the
municipal rate.

5-4-4: BILLING AND PAYING FOR SERVICES:
   A.   Billing Period: The superintendent shall bill users for sewer and water
service on a monthly basis, said charges to be based on the amount registered
by the user's water meter for the billing period, or an estimate of the amount
of water provided to the customer's premises when the user's water meter has
not been read.
   B.   Access To Meters; Reading Meters: The superintendent shall cause all
water meters of users to be read at least once every three (3) months. It is
the duty of all customers of the combined system and of all persons, firms or
entities having an ownership or occupancy interest in customer's premises
receiving the benefit of sewer and water service, including their agents,
trustees, receivers, successors, grantees, assigns and representatives, to
provide prompt and efficient access to the user's water meter. In the case of
water meters that are in locations that are not accessible to the
superintendent, it is the customer's duty to provide keys to permit access to
the water meter by the town's meter readers, or to be present to provide prompt
access to the water meter upon request by the town's meter readers. Failure to
provide prompt and efficient access to the user's water meter is cause for
termination of sewer and water utility service from the combined system.
Repeated failure to provide prompt access to the user's water meter is cause
for the Superintendent to relocate the water meter, or to provide one or more
additional water meters, at locations on or about the customer's premises that
are accessible to the Superintendent, the cost of which shall be an additional
charge to the user.
   C.   Bill For Sewer And Water Service: Charges for sewer and water service
shall be paid at the Town Hall within fifteen (15) days after the billing date
on the user's bill. All other charges shall be due and payable when billed.
   D.   Combined Bills For Sewer And Water Service And For Garbage Collection
And Disposal Service: Charges for garbage collection and disposal services
provided and made available to owners of any single-family, duplex and two-
family apartment buildings in the Leyden Township Special Refuse Collection and
Disposal District, and any charges for the abatement of a nuisance as provided
in section
3-4-10 of this Code, shall be added to and collected as part of the sewer and
water bill issued for such property and shall be paid at the Town Hall within
fifteen (15) days after the billing date on the user's bill.
   E.   Late Charges: A late charge amount equal to five percent (5%) of the
bill shall be added and charged on any bill for sewer and water service, on any
combined bill for sewer and water service and for garbage collection and
disposal service, and on any bill for abatement of a nuisance as provided in
section
3-4-10 of this Code, that remains unpaid for more than fifteen (15) days after
the billing due date. An additional five percent (5%) monthly late fee shall be
added and charged for each subsequent month or part thereof that such bill
remains unpaid. Any partial payments of a delinquent bill shall first be
applied to late charges and penalties, and then to the principal amount of the
charges. If applicable, late charges shall include the cost of recording liens
against the customer's premises. Change of ownership or occupancy of customer's
premises shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating these penalties.
   F.   Disconnection of Utility Service For Failure To Pay Bill: Any user who
has not paid the charges billed for sewer and water service, for garbage and
disposal service as provided in Section
3-4-11 of this Code, for nuisance abatement as provided in Section
3-4-10 of this Code, or any penalties for violations of Chapters 1 and 3 of
Article 4 of this Code ("Public Ways and Property"), within thirty (30) days of
the date of the issuance of the bill for such services or penalties may have
the user's utility service cut off by the Superintendent in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this title.
   G.   The charges billed by the Town for sewer and water service, for garbage
and disposal service as provided in Section
3-4-11 of this Code, for nuisance abatement as provided in Section
3-4-10 of this Code, or any penalties for violations of Chapters 1 and 3 of
Article 4 of this Code ("Public Ways and Property"), shall be a debt to the
Town. All persons, firms or entities having an ownership or occupancy interest
in premises receiving the benefit of sewer and water service, including their
agents, trustees, receivers, successors, grantees, assigns and representatives,
are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of all charges billed to
the user and due the Town.
   H.   Lien For Charges: Charges for services that are not paid within fifteen
(15) days after they are due shall be deemed delinquent. Charges that are not
paid within thirty (30) days after they are due shall be a lien against the
real estate being served and shall be subject to enforcement and collection as
provided by law. Change of ownership or occupancy of customer's premises shall
not be cause for reducing or eliminating charges for sewer and water service or
for garbage collection and disposal services.
   I.   Notice Of Delinquency: At least five (5) working days before any action
is taken to enforce the lien or collect the debt for delinquent charges, the
Superintendent shall send or deliver a written notice of delinquency to owner
or occupant of the premises upon or for which service was supplied, which
notice shall state the amount of delinquent charges. Failure to provide or
receive such notice, however, shall not affect the validity of the debt or any
judgment secured or lien filed to collect the debt.
   J.   Enforcement Of Lien: The lien for delinquent charges may be enforced in
the manner set forth below and in any other manner authorized by statute.
      1.   Notice of the lien shall be filed in the Office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Cook County (or in the Office of the Registrar of Titles of Cook
County if the property affected is registered under the torrens system). The
notice of lien shall be verified by the affidavit of the Superintendent or any
subordinate of the Superintendent familiar with the facts and shall consist of
a statement setting forth the following:
         a.   A description of the premises or real estate sufficient for
identification thereof upon or for which the services underlying the charges
were supplied;
         b.   The amount or amounts of money due for the services supplied; and
         c.   The date or dates when such amount or amounts became delinquent.
      2.   Upon the filing of the notice of lien, the town may foreclose the
lien in like manner and in like effect as the foreclosure of mortgages on real
estate.
   K.   Sale Of Property:
      1.   It is the obligation of real estate purchasers to establish credit
and a sewer and water account in their name upon the purchase of real estate or
customer's premises served by the combined system, and to ensure that charges
for sewer and water service provided to the premises, or for garbage collection
and disposal service provided to the premises, have been paid prior to the
transfer of legal or beneficial title or interest in the property or customer's
premises.
      2.   It is the responsibility of the real estate seller, and the customer
if different than the real estate seller, to pay all charges due for sewer and
water service provided to the premises and for garbage collection and disposal
service provided to the premises, and to close the sewer and water account
prior to the transfer of legal or beneficial title or interest in the property
or customer's premises. Payoff statements will be provided upon request.
      3.   Failure of a real estate purchaser to establish credit and a new
sewer and water account within thirty (30) days of transfer of legal or
beneficial title or interest in the customer premises will result in a default
account transfer charge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for failure to timely
establish a new sewer and water account with responsibility for sewer and water
service to the customer premises.
   L.   Security Deposit:
      1.   The town reserves the right at any time to require a new or existing
customer to provide a credit reference. As a condition to continuing sewer and
water service to a customer, or reinstating sewer and water service that has
been disconnected as provided in this title, the superintendent may require a
deposit to secure full and timely payment of the customer's account if an
account is delinquent, paid with a bad check, or if the customer otherwise
fails to establish or maintain good credit with the town.
      2.   Landlords shall be required to establish and maintain a security
deposit to secure full and timely payment of the customer's account if an
account is held in the name of a tenant.
   M.   Action To Collect Debt: The town may file an action in the circuit
court of Cook County to recover money due for services from the combined
system, for garbage collection and disposal service provided to the premises,
or for nuisance abatement as provided in section
3-4-10 of this code, plus a reasonable attorney fee to be fixed by the court. A
judgment entered in such a civil action operates as a release and waiver of the
lien upon the real estate for the amount of judgment.
   N.   Release Of Lien: Any lien, claim for lien or suit to foreclose the lien
shall be released, discharged or dismissed upon payment of the charges, court
costs, recording fees, and all other expenditures made or incurred by the town
in perfecting and enforcing its lien.
   O.   NSF Charges; Payment With Good Funds: If a check, draft or other
instrument is tendered to the town in payment of a bill for sewer and water
service, and such check, draft or other instrument is not honored upon
presentment for payment, a charge of twenty five dollars ($25.00) shall be
added to the customer's charges for sewer and water service. Following
disconnection of sewer and water service, or payment of a bill for sewer and
water service with a bad or NSF check, draft or instrument, the superintendent
may require the customer to pay all outstanding and future charges with a
certified check, bank check, cashier's check, U.S. post office money order, or
cash.
   P.   Charges For Reinstating Service: Any user who has not timely paid the
charges billed for services under this section, and who has had utility service
to the user's property cut off as a result of such nonpayment, shall make an
appointment with the Superintendent to reinstate utility service upon payment
of all such charges. The charge for reinstating sewer and water utility service
shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per service.
   Q.   Accounting Directive: The corporate authorities of Leyden Township have
determined that the compounding of user charges, penalties and delinquent
charges imposed on vacant properties pursuant to this code during the severe
economic downturn of recent years has resulted in unanticipated large
delinquent accounts due to the township, which delinquencies may adversely
affect the marketability of such vacant parcels, and which may in turn
adversely affect the value of neighboring properties. Having further determined
that large uncollectible delinquencies distort the financial reporting of the
combined system, the board of trustees do hereby authorize and direct the
superintendent and treasurer of the combined system to reduce and mark down the
delinquent account balances of properties served by the combined system as
follows:
      1.   All residential and municipal rate customer accounts with a
delinquent account balance in excess of sixty five thousand dollars
($65,000.00) as of the end of the billing period terminating on or before April
30, 2019, and which: a) have been vacant and unoccupied for more than six (6)
months; b) are not consuming any water as determined by the most recent meter
reading, shall be reduced and restated as having an outstanding account balance
of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) as of May 1, 2019.
      2.   All commercial rate customer accounts with a delinquent account
balance in excess of sixty five thousand dollars ($65,000.00) as of the end of
the billing period terminating on or before April 30, 2019, and which:
         a.   Have been vacant and unoccupied for more than six (6) months;
         b.   Are not consuming any water as determined by the most recent
meter reading, shall be reduced and restated as having an outstanding account
balance of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) as of May 1, 2019.
   Notwithstanding subsection
5-4-3 J. of this chapter, the superintendent is authorized to adjust and
compromise the amount required to satisfy the delinquent accounts described in
this subsection.

the waterworks and sewerage fund. (Ord. SWO-89-1, 8-8-1989)
5-4-6: CREDIT CARD ACCEPTANCE PROGRAM:
   The superintendent is authorized to accept payments of the service charges
due from customers under the provisions of this chapter, including garbage
collection and disposal charges, by accepting credit card payments as provided
herein.
   A.   The superintendent is authorized to enter into agreements with one or
more financial institutions or other service providers to facilitate the
acceptance and processing of credit card payments for the satisfaction of
service charges under this chapter. Such agreements may include a discount fee
to cover the costs, fees, assessments or surcharges imposed by the service
provider.
   B.   A convenience fee may be imposed upon the customer making payment by
credit card in an amount not to exceed the discount or processing fee incurred
by the township by its acceptance of the customer's credit card payments.
   C.   Subject to regulations established by the superintendent, a customer
may pay all outstanding bills for sewer and water service, including any fees,
penalties and interest that may be due, and any convenience fee imposed upon
credit card payments, by charging such amount to a credit card accepted by the
township or by the financial institution or other service provider contracted

   A.   If, in accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code or in the judgment of
the Superintendent, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary for the
safety of the public water supply system, the Superintendent shall give notice
to the water customer to install such approved device immediately. The water
customer shall, at the customer’s own expense, install such an approved device
at a location and in a manner in accordance with the Illinois Plumbing Code,
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and all applicable Town
regulations, and shall have inspections and tests made of such approved devices
as required by the Illinois Plumbing Code, the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency and Town regulations.
   B.   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the Town may enter the supply or distribution system of the
Town, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water supply and the method
of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved by the
Superintendent and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
   C.   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent to cause surveys and
investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply to determine whether actual or potential hazards to the
public water supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a
matter of public record and shall be repeated at least every two (2) years, or
as often as the Superintendent shall deem necessary. Records of such surveys
shall be maintained and available for review for a period of at least five (5)
years.
   D.   The approved cross-connection control device inspector (CCCDI) shall
have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the Town for
the purpose of verifying the presence or absence of cross-connections, and the
Superintendent or an authorized agent shall have the right to enter at any
reasonable time any property served by a connection to the public water supply
or distribution system of the Town for the purpose of verifying information
submitted by the customer regarding the required cross-connection control
inspection. On demand, the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the Superintendent any information which he may request
regarding the piping systems or water use on such property. The refusal of such

5-5-2: GENERAL POLICY:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of these rules and regulations is:
      1.   To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the customer’s water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water supply system.
      2.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer’s potable water and non-
potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or systems containing
substances of unknown or questionable quality.
      3.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will prevent the contamination of pollution of the
public and consumer’s potable water systems.
   B.   Application: These rules and regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water supply system of the Town.
   C.   Policy: The Superintendent shall be responsible for protection of the
public water supply system from contamination due to backflow or back-siphonage
of contaminants through the customer’s water service connection. If, in the
judgment of the Superintendent or an authorized representative, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
supply system, the Superintendent shall give notice to the consumer to install
such approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to the
premises. The consumer, after due written notice and within the prescribed time
indicated on the notice, shall install such approved device or devices at the
consumer’s own expense; failure or refusal on the part of the consumer to
install such device or devices immediately shall constitute grounds for
discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or devices have
been installed. The consumer shall retain records of installation, maintenance,
testing and repair by this Chapter for a period of at least five (5) years. The
Superintendent may require the consumer to submit a cross- connection
inspection report to the Superintendent to assist in determining whether or not
service line protection will be required. (Ord. SWO-94-2, 10-11-1994; amd. Ord.
