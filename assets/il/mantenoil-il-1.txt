certified as to correctness and available for inspection at any and all times
that said office is regularly open.
   SECTION 3. All ordinances of a general nature included in this Official
Village Code shall be considered as a continuation of said ordinance provision,

effectiveness of ordinances included in said Official Village Code.
All ordinances of a special nature, such as tax levy ordinances, bond
ordinances, franchises, vacating ordinances and annexation ordinances shall
continue in full force and effect unless specifically repealed or amended by a
provision of the Village Code. Such ordinances are not intended to be included
in the Official Village Code.

change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or
to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such

misrepresented thereby.

penalty, of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the village
issuing a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure
to file penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the
total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was

taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days' delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-29, 1-2-2001)

the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.

years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (B)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
village, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due,
the statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the
calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (C)   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 00-29, 1-2-2001)
1-18-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals or the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 00-29, 1-2-2001)
1-18-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax ordinance on the
internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all tax
ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the village
clerk's office. (Ord. 00-29, 1-2-2001)
1-18-17: INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
00-29, 1-2-2001)
1-18-18: APPLICATION:

or executed by any village official, employee, or agent, including any
engineer, architect, or construction manager, that increases, or would have the
effect of increasing, the contract price by more than five thousand dollars
($5,000) or five (5%) percent (excluding allowances in the contract), whichever
is greater, without the prior approval of the board of trustees announced at a
regular or special meeting held for such purpose.
   (G)   No change order or construction change directive shall be approved or
executed that necessitates an increase in the contract price by fifty (50%)
percent or more of the original contract price without resubmitting that
portion to bidding in the same manner in which the original contract was bid in
accordance with the Illinois Public Works Contract Change Order Act (50 ILCS
525/1, et seq.).
   (H)   In the case of an emergency, the village president, or his/her
designee, with the prior consensus of not less than four (4) trustees, shall
have the authority to purchase or contract for equipment, goods, materials,

credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become due,
under this chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the erroneous
payment; provided, however, the village treasurer may request, and
telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such

the amount of the village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the village plus five percent
(5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any
costs incurred by the village in conducting the audit, in an amount not to
exceed five percent (5%) of the total amount of the underpayment determined in
an audit. Said sum shall be paid to the village within twenty one (21) days

franchise area to the extent that such extension is or may become technically
and economically feasible.

from at least fifteen (15) subscribers within four hundred (400) cable meters
(1,300 cable feet) of its aerial trunk cable, or from at least twenty five (25)
subscribers within four hundred (400) cable meters (1,300 cable feet) of its
underground trunk cable, it shall extend its system to such subscribers solely

distribution cable to connection of service to subscribers is more than forty
five meters (45 m) (150 cable feet) or when a subscriber density exists less
than the density specified hereinabove, service may be made available on the

served by underground utilities, the developer of the subdivision or
development may acquire CATV service for this development under the following
conditions; but otherwise the grantee shall not be obligated to construct a

backfilling necessary for the provision of cable television service, including
furnishing of any imported backfill material required, and will furnish and
install for the grantee any necessary distribution conduit and substructures,
including pedestals, required in accordance with the grantee's plans and
specifications. Developer may enter into a written agreement with the grantee
whereby such costs may be reimbursed to the developer by grantee at the rate of
fifty percent (50%) of basic subscriber receipts generated from CATV service
supplied within the development over a period not to exceed three (3) years.
In addition to providing plans and specifications to the developer, the grantee
shall inspect the facilities required hereunder and certify to the village
prior to final approval of the subdivision or development that the facilities
required herein are properly installed. The village shall have the right to
review and require its approval of the maps and specifications provided by the
grantee. The cost of that portion of an extension to a subdivision or
development from the grantee's existing facilities in excess of sixty meters
(60 m) (200 feet) outside the boundaries of the subdivision or development
shall be borne by the developer. Facilities installed hereunder shall be owned,
operated and maintained by grantee. (Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)

percentage of three percent (3%) of its gross receipts. Sales taxes, use or
other taxes levied on a per subscriber basis and collected by the grantee shall
be deducted from the gross receipts in computing any sums due to the village.
   (B)   The percentage payments shall be made annually within thirty (30) days
after the expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which such
franchise is in force.
   (C)   At the time of payment, grantee shall provide the village an annual
summary report in respect of gross receipts received during the preceding year.

term of twenty (20) years from the date of its acceptance by the grantee.
   (B)   The village may terminate any franchise granted pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter in the event of the wilful failure, refusal or
neglect by grantee to do or comply with any material requirement or limitation
contained in this chapter.
   (C)   The president may make written demand that the grantee do or comply
with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation. If
the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of thirty
(30) days following such written demand, the president may place his request
for termination of the franchise upon the next regular board meeting agenda.
The president shall cause to be served upon such grantee, at least ten (10)
days prior to the date of such board meeting, a written notice of his intent to
request such termination, and the time and place of the meeting, notice of
which shall be published by the village clerk at least once ten (10) days
before such meeting in a newspaper of general circulation within the village.
   (D)   The board shall consider the request of the president and shall hear
any persons interested therein, including the grantee, and shall determine, in
its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee
was with just cause.
   (E)   If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, the board shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner
and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
   (F)   If the board shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then the board may, by resolution, declare that
the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and forfeited unless there be
compliance by the grantee within such period as the board may fix.
   (G)   The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way affect
any of the rights of the village under the franchise or any provision of law.
   (H)   Prior to expiration, any franchise granted hereunder may be extended
for a term or terms of not less than five (5) years duration which, in the
opinion of the board, would serve the public interest. The procedure to
consider such an extension shall be as follows:
      1.   During the sixteenth year of the term of this franchise, or sixty
(60) months prior to the expiration of any extended term thereof, the board
shall review the performance of the grantee and shall determine whether the
grantee has satisfactorily performed its obligations under the franchise. To
determine satisfactory performance, the board shall look at technical
developments and performance of system, programming, other services offered,
cost of service, and any other particular requirement set forth in the
resolution. If the board finds the grantee's performance satisfactory, the
franchise may be extended pursuant to an amendment to the chapter.
      2.   In the event the current grantee is determined by the board to have
performed unsatisfactorily, or, in the event that the board fails to make a
determination prior to the last day of the sixteenth year of this franchise, or
at least forty eight (48) months prior to the expiration of any extended term
hereof, as the case may be, which failure shall be deemed a refusal to extend
the term of this franchise, then the grantee may sell all of its equipment,
hardware and property owned, installed or used by it in the conduct of its
rights under the franchise for the unexpired term of said franchise to a third
party and the approval of the board to such sale and transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In the event that the grantee shall give notice to the
village of the proposed sale and request approval of the village thereto, then
the village shall have the sole option to approve such sale or to purchase all
of grantee's equipment and property owned, installed or used by grantee in the
conduct of its CATV business in the village at a price equal to the greater of:
a) The price to be paid by the prospective third party purchaser pursuant to
the provisions of the preceding sentence; or b) the fair market value as
determined by three (3) independent appraisers, one of which shall be selected
by the board, one of which shall be selected by the grantee, and the third to
be selected by the first two (2) appraisers; provided, however, if the village
has failed at any time to grant upon the request of grantee a rate increase
comparable to rates of other similar systems and in any event a rate which will
provide a reasonable rate of return on assets in service to the franchise, then
such appraisal shall be based upon the assumption that grantee is, at the time
of appraisal, receiving the rate increase so requested. (Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)
3-17-9: BONDS; INDEMNIFICATIONS; INSURANCE:
   (A)   Performance Bond To The Village: Upon being granted a franchise, and
upon the filing of acceptance required under this chapter, the grantee shall
file with the village clerk and shall thereafter, annually, during the entire
term of such franchise, maintain in full force and effect a corporate surety
bond, cash or other adequate surety agreement in the amount of thirty five
thousand dollars ($35,000.00). The bond or agreement shall be so conditioned
that in the event that grantee shall fail to comply with any one or more of the
provisions of this chapter, or of such franchise, then there shall be
recoverable jointly and severally from the principal and surety any damages or
loss, or costs suffered or incurred by the village as a result thereof,
including attorney fees and costs of any action or proceeding, and including
the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, cost of removal or
abandonment of any property or other costs which may be in default, up to the
full principal amount of such bond. Said condition shall be a continuing
obligation during the entire term of such franchise and thereafter until
grantee shall have satisfied in full any and all obligations to the village
which arise out of or pertain to said franchise. Neither the provisions of this
chapter, nor any bond accepted by the village pursuant hereto, nor any damages
recovered by the village thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful
performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under any
franchise issued pursuant to this chapter or for damages either to the full
amount of the bond, or otherwise.
   (B)   Hold Harmless: Grantee shall indemnify and hold harmless the village,
its officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees against and from any
and all claims, demands, causes of actions, actions, suits, proceedings,
damages (including, but not limited to, damages to village property and damages
arising out of copyright infringements, and damages arising out of any failure
by grantee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors or
licensees of programs to be delivered by grantee's cable television system),
costs or liabilities (including costs or liabilities of the village with
respect to its employees), of every kind and nature whatsoever, including, but
not limited to, damages for injury or death or damage to person or property,
and against all liability to others, and against any loss, cost and expense
resulting or arising out of any of the same, including any attorney fees,
accountant fees, expert witness or consultant fees, court costs, per diem
expense, traveling and transportation expense, or other costs of expense which
may accrue to or be suffered or claimed by any person or persons arising out of
or pertaining to the negligence of the grantee in the ownership, construction,
repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of said cable television system,
provided that the village gives the grantee prompt notice of any such claims,
actions and suits, in writing, without limitation. Any and all claims, demands,
causes of actions, actions, suits, proceedings, damages, cost or liabilities
resulting from use of the cable television system by the village, its agents
and employees, shall be the sole liability and responsibility of the village.
   (C)   Insurance Required: Upon being granted a franchise, and upon the
filing of the acceptance required under this chapter hereof, the grantee shall
file with the village clerk and shall thereafter during the entire term of such
franchise maintain in full force and effect at its own cost and expense each of
the following policies of insurance:
      1.   General comprehensive liability insurance in the amount of one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00), together with bodily injury liability
insurance in the amount of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00)
for injuries including accidental death, to any one person and subject to the
same limit for each person in an amount not less than one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) on account of any one occurrence, and property damage liability
insurance in any amount not less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00)
resulting from any occurrence; provided, however, as follows:
         (a)   The village shall be named as an additional insured in any of
said insurance policies; and
         (b)   Where such insurance is provided by a policy which also covers
grantee or any other entity or person, it shall contain the standard cross
liability endorsement. (Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)
3-17-10: ACCEPTANCE OF THE FRANCHISE:
   (A)   No franchise granted under this chapter shall become effective for any
purpose unless and until written acceptance thereof shall have been filed with
the village clerk. Written acceptance, which shall be in the form and substance
approved by the village attorney, shall also be and operate as an acceptance of
each and every term and condition and limitation contained in this chapter, or
in such franchise, or otherwise specified as herein provided.
   (B)   The written acceptance shall be filed by the grantee not later than
one minute after twelve o'clock (12:01) P.M. of the thirtieth day next
following the effective date of the ordinance granting such franchise.
   (C)   In default of the filing of such written acceptance, as herein
required, the grantee shall be deemed to have rejected and repudiated the
franchise. Thereafter, the acceptance of the grantee shall not be received nor
filed by the village clerk. The grantee shall have no rights, remedies or
redress in the premises, unless and until the board, by resolution, shall
determine that such acceptance be received or filed, and then upon such terms
and conditions as the board may impose. (Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)
3-17-11: LIMITATIONS OF FRANCHISE:
   (A)   Every franchise granted under this chapter shall be nonexclusive.
   (B)   Any such franchise shall be a privilege to be held in personal trust
by the original grantee. It cannot in any event be sold, transferred, leased,
assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary
sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, other than to a
person or entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
grantee, without prior consent of the board expressed by resolution and then
only under such conditions as may therein be prescribed. The said consent of
the board may not be unreasonably refused; provided, however, the proposed
assignee must agree in writing to comply with all provisions of the ordinance;
and provided, further, that no such consent shall be required for a transfer in
trust, mortgage or other hypothecation, in whole or in part to secure on
indebtedness.
   In the event that grantee is a corporation, prior approval of the village
board, expressed by ordinance, shall be required where there is an actual
change in control where ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the
voting stock of grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in
concert, none of whom already own fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting
stock, singly or collectively. Any such acquisition occurring without prior
approval of the village board shall constitute a failure to comply with a
provision of the chapter within the meaning of section
3-17-8 of this chapter.
   (C)   Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer, employee,
department or board of the village shall be subject to transfer by the village
to any other officer, employee, department or board of the village.
   (D)   The grantee shall at all times during the life of this franchise be
subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the village. The village
reserves the right to adopt from time to time, in addition to the provisions
herein contained, such ordinances as may be necessary to the exercise of police
power. Such regulation shall be reasonable and not in derogation of the rights
herein granted, nor in conflict with the laws of the state or other local or
federal laws or regulations.
   (E)   Any such franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any
obligations involved in obtaining pole or conduit space from any department of
the village, utility company, or from other maintaining utilities in streets.
(Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)
   (F)   Rates:
      1.   Prior to granting any franchise hereunder the board, by resolution,

grantee, such as:
         (a)   Charges for installation (single dwelling only) – twenty dollars
($20.00).
         (b)   Subscriber rates – ten dollars fifty cents ($10.50).
         (c)   Service charges for separate classifications of service (e.g.,
additional connections) – two dollars fifty cents ($2.50).
         (d)   Connector deposit – twenty five dollars ($25.00).
The above amendments are made by the village board with the understanding and
upon the condition that franchisee shall provide an additional four (4)
channels to the subscriber of said service and same shall be available for use
on or before June 1, 1986. (Ord. 85-16, 4-21-1986)
      2.   Absent actions resulting in reassignment of jurisdiction to approve
increases in rates for basic subscriber services to some other authority, such
rates shall be subject to modification upon approval by the council by
resolution in accordance with the following procedures:
         (a)   Not more than once in any calendar year, grantee may petition
the village board for increases in all or any part of its rates. Such petition
shall include a revised rate schedule and justification therefor. Such petition
shall be accompanied by a current balance sheet and statement of earnings for
grantee's CATV operation within the village with supporting schedules of income
and expenses.
         (b)   Within sixty (60) calendar days following the receipt of a
request for a change in rates, the board may conduct a public hearing thereon,
or approve the rate change as presented. If a public hearing is held then
within thirty (30) calendar days following the public hearing the board, by
resolution, shall approve, deny or modify the requested change in rates which
resolution shall include appropriate findings of fact in connection therewith
if the petition is denied or modified. If the village fails to reach a decision
within ninety (90) calendar days following receipt of a request for change in
rates, the proposed revised rate schedule shall be deemed approved.
         (c)   Grantee shall be entitled to fair and reasonable rates and
charges or basic CATV service no higher than necessary to costs of service,
assuming efficient and economical management including a fair return on the
fair value of the properties devoted to such service, such rates and charges
not to be unreasonably discriminatory. The rates and charges for which village
approval is required shall be limited to basic subscriber service.
         (d)   Not less than thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the
offering of any services or equipment, other than basic subscriber service
including expanded service, there shall be filed with the village a schedule of
the rates and charges and the rules relating to such services or equipment.
Within thirty (30) calendar days prior to the effective date thereof, there
shall be filed with the village changes to such schedule of rates and charges.

   (C)   Within two hundred ten (210) days after the commencement of
construction and installation of the system, grantee shall proceed to render
service to subscribers, and the completion of the installation and construction
shall be pursued with reasonable diligence thereafter, so that service to all
of the areas designated and scheduled on the map and plan of construction made
part of the franchise shall be provided as set forth therein; provided,
however, that grantee shall in all events meet and comply with any construction
requirements set down by the FCC or any other applicable regulatory authority.
   (D)   Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue
each of the foregoing requirements, and to complete each of the foregoing
requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth herein, shall be
grounds for termination of such franchise. By resolution, the board, in its
discretion, may extend the time for the commencement and completion of
installation and construction for additional periods in the event the grantee,
acting in good faith, experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond his
control.
   (E)   Grantee shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities
whenever feasible or practical; and shall not construct or install any new,
different or additional poles, conduits or other facilities whether on public
property or on privately owned property.
   (F)   In the event that:
      1.   The use of any part of the system of grantee is discontinued for any
reason for a continuous period of thirty (30) days without prior written notice
to and approval by the village; or
      2.   Any part of such system has been installed in any street or other
area without complying with the requirements hereof; or
      3.   Any franchise shall be terminated, canceled or shall expire, then
the grantee shall, at the option of the village and at the expense of the
grantee and at no expense to the village, and upon demand of the village,
promptly remove from any streets or other area all property of grantee except
the underground plant which may be abandoned in place, and grantee shall
promptly restore the street or other area from which such property has been
removed to such reasonable condition as the president shall approve.
The board may, upon written application therefor by grantee, approve the
abandonment of nonunderground property in place by grantee and under such terms
and conditions as the board may prescribe. Upon abandonment of any such
property in place, grantee shall cause to be executed, acknowledged and
delivered to the village such instruments as the village attorney shall
prescribe and approve, transferring and conveying the ownership of such
property to the village. (Ord. 82-1, 2-1-1982)

be filed with the village shall be filed with the village clerk.

commission of the state of Illinois, or any other federal or state body or

subject matter of any franchise granted under this chapter, then to the extent,
such jurisdiction shall preempt or preclude the exercise of like jurisdiction
by the village, the jurisdiction of the village shall cease and no longer
exist.
   (F)   No person, firm or corporation within the service area of the grantee,
and where trunk lines are in place, shall be refused service; provided,

to any person found in violation of this Section may be that said person must
engage in public service by cleaning the rights-of-way and other public
facilities of the Village for an amount of time that, if the person found to

may consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property,
including, but not limited to:
      1.   The disturbance of neighbors.
      2.   The recurrence of loud and obnoxious noises.
      3.   Repeated consumption of alcohol in public. (Ord. 00-20, 11-20-2000)
5-1-16-3: ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE:
The corporation counsel of the village of Manteno or the state's attorney of
Kankakee County may commence an action to abate public nuisance as described
above. Upon being satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence that an
alleged public nuisance exists, the court may, without notice or bond, enter a

from maintaining such nuisance and may enter an order restraining any defendant
from removing or interfering with all property used in connection with the
public nuisance. (Ord. 00-20, 11-20-2000)
5-1-16-4: PROCEDURE:
When the chief of police of the village of Manteno receives two (2) or more
police reports documenting the occurrence of nuisance activity on or within a
property, the chief of police shall independently review such reports to
determine whether they describe criminal acts. Upon such findings, the chief of
police may:
   (A)   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property is in danger
of becoming a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the following
information:
      1.   The street address or a legal description sufficient for
identification of the property;
      2.   A statement that the chief of police has information that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the
nuisance activities that may exist, or that have occurred. The chief of police
shall offer the person in charge an opportunity to propose a course of action
that the chief of police agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise
to the violation;
      3.   Demand that the person in charge respond to the chief of police
within ten (10) days to discuss the nuisance activities.
   (B)   After complying with the notification procedures described herein,
when the chief of police receives a police report documenting the occurrence of
a third nuisance activity at or within a property and determines that the
property has become a chronic nuisance property, the chief of police shall:
      1.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property has been
determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall contain the
following information:
         (a)   The street address or legal description sufficient for
identification of the property.
         (b)   A statement that the chief of police has determined the property
to be chronic nuisance property with a concise description of the nuisance
activities leading to his/her findings.
         (c)   Demand that the person in charge respond within ten (10) days to
the chief of police and propose a course of action that the chief of police
agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation.
         (d)   Service shall be made either personally or by first class mail,
postage prepaid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in charge at
the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or such
other place which is likely to give the person in charge notice of the
determination by the chief of police.
         (e)   A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such
address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is
located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these persons
are different than the person in charge, and shall be made either personally or
by first class mail, postage prepaid.
         (f)   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property after
ten (10) days have elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the
person in charge and the person in charge has not contacted the chief of
police.
         (g)   The failure of any person to receive notice that the property
may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
proceedings under this chapter.
      2.   If after the notification, but prior to the commencement of legal
proceedings by the village pursuant to this chapter, a person in charge
stipulates with the chief of police that the person in charge will pursue a
course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving
rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal
proceedings for a period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30)
days, except in the case of a nuisance activity where a search warrant was
executed at the property. If the agreed course of action does not result in the
abatement of the nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is
reached within thirty (30) days, the chief of police shall request
authorization for the corporation counsel to commence a legal proceeding to
abate the nuisance.
      3.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth herein, the
chief of police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any documentation
which supports legal proceedings to the corporation counsel.
   (C)   Where a person in charge makes a response to the chief of police as
required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with the
furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any nuisance
activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require the
exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for any
other purpose. (Ord. 00-20, 11-20-2000)
5-1-16-5: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION, BURDEN OF PROOF:
   (A)   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the
village shall have the initial burden of showing by preponderance of the
evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (B)   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of chronic nuisance
property that the owner of the property at the time in question could not, in
the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had
become a public nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of
reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that
the property is a chronic nuisance property.
   (C)   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court
may consider any of the following factors if they need be found appropriate,
and shall cite those found applicable:
      1.   The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to
mitigate or correct the problem at the property.
      2.   Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous.
      3.   The magnitude or gravity of the problem.
      4.   The cooperation of the person in charge with the village.
      5.   The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting
to correct the condition. (Ord. 00-20, 11-20-2000)
5-1-16-6: EMERGENCY CLOSING PROCEDURES:
   (A)   In the event that it is determined that the property is an immediate
threat to the public safety and welfare, the village may apply to the court for
such interim relief, as is deemed by the chief of police to be appropriate. In
such an event the notification provision set forth in section
5-1-16-4 of this chapter need not be complied with, however, the village shall
make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court hearing.
   (B)   In the event that the court finds the property constitutes a "chronic
nuisance property" as defined in section
5-1-16-1 of this chapter, the court may order the remedy set out above. In
addition, in the event that it also finds the person in charge had knowledge of
activities or conditions of the property constituting or violating this chapter
and permitted the activities to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as
provided above.
   (C)   The court may authorize the village of Manteno to physically secure
the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so
within the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is
authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village
to effect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the property.
If used herein, "costs" mean these costs actually incurred by the village for
the physical securing of the property, as well as tenant relocation costs.
   (D)   The village of Manteno department of public works effecting the
closure shall prepare a statement of cost and the village of Manteno shall
thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection
of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in
said amount may be recorded against said property.
   (E)   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by
the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.
   (F)   A tenant is entitled to their reasonable relocation costs, as those
are determined by the court if, without actual notice, the tenant moved into
this property, after either:
      1.   The owner or tenant received notice as described herein of the
police chief's determination as described above.
      2.   Unknown owner or other agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to this section.
      3.   Any person who is assessed with costs of closure and/or civil
penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the
village. (Ord. 00-20, 11-20-2000)

once per year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents
of the wastewater discharge to assure that compliance with the federal, state
and local standards are being met. The owner shall report the results of
measurements and laboratory analyses to the village at such times and in such
manner as prescribed by the village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the village. At such times as
deemed necessary, the village reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
   (J)   Sampling: All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standards Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health
Association, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon
suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special
manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the

to which the well is expected to be drilled, or has been drilled, if the well
shaft has been drilled but the well is not yet operational, the name of the
entity that drilled the well, and the purpose for which the water is to be
used. Before issuing a license, the village may seek a written report from the
village engineer as to whether a well at this location or depth will interfere
with the potable water supply provided by the village to its citizens or
present other health and safety hazards. In the event that the construction of
the well will not automatically create health, safety or capacity concerns, a
permit shall be issued, and the well may be constructed and operated subject to
the regulations contained in subsection (B) of this section, or otherwise
contained in village ordinances. If the well has not been drilled, the
applicant shall provide to the village, within fifteen (15) working days after
completion, a statement as to the final depth of the completed well. An
application relating to the expansion of the well shall be filed and a new
permit issued under the same terms and conditions as set forth above, if the
well is to be expanded or deepened.
   (B)   Inspection And Equipment:
      1.   The owner or operator of the well shall not place it into operation
without offering the municipality a period of at least seven (7) working days
after a notice is given to inspect the completed well. If the well includes a
structure which would require a permit under the ordinances of the village,
such a permit shall be sought as well as any other required permit, such as an
electrical permit. If, during the inspection process, the village should find
that the well has not been built in accordance with the original application,
or in accordance with this section, the owner or operator shall not commence
the operation of the well until the facility shall so comply.
      2.   The owner or operator shall install, at the owner's or operator's
cost, equipment, as a part of the well, which will perform the following
functions:
         (a)   A flow meter showing the total gallons pumped by the well;
         (b)   An hour meter, which will record the gallons pumped per minute;
         (c)   A gauge or other device showing the water levels both during
static periods and during pumping.
   The owner or developer shall seek the authorization of the village to
install devices to perform these readings, but the village shall not
unreasonably refuse to approve the installation of equipment which will
accurately provide such information.
   The owner or operator of the well shall report on the information and
calibration provided by such monitoring devices on such a schedule as the
village shall require, but, in any case, not less frequently than every month.
   (C)   Suspension Of Well: In the event that the village president should
conclude that the continuing operation of the well is likely to imminently
endanger the public health or safety, or to diminish the supply of potable
water available within the village, he or she may order, on not less than six
(6) hours' notice, the temporary suspension of the operations of the well. Such
notice shall be delivered in writing to the person or entity known to be the
owner of the well or the person or entity with operational control of the well.
That owner or operator shall immediately suspend the use of the well. The
initial suspension may not be for a period of more than fourteen (14) days, and
during that period of time, the village president shall schedule a hearing to
determine whether the nature of the suspension may be modified from a complete
termination of operations to a lesser restriction or whether the termination
shall continue until the health, or safety hazard, or the capacity problem has
ceased. The village determines, as a matter of public policy, that the
protection of the municipal potable water system is superior to that of
nonpotable water uses until the danger to health, safety or capacity has ceased
or diminished.
   (D)   Penalty: Any person, firm, corporation or any other entity, which
violates any of the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction thereof,
be fined not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense, nor
more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for each offense. Each day
during which a violation occurs shall be considered a separate offense. In
addition, the village may seek injunctive or other relief necessary to
implement the terms and conditions of this section. (Ord. 03-06, 6-16-2003;
amd. Ord. 07-13, 8-6-2007)
6-3-2: REQUIRED CONNECTION TO MUNICIPAL WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM; WELLS
PROHIBITED:
   (A)   Prior to annexation into the Village of any property, the property
owner must notify the Village of the number and location of every well and
septic system on the property.
   (B)   It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant, or party or parties in
possession of any house, structure, institutional or commercial establishment
or any other building of any character located on property abutting on the
municipal water or sewer system, to cause such house, structure, institutional
or commercial establishment or other building to be connected with the said
municipal water or sewer system within thirty six (36) months from the date
that water or sewerage facilities become available to such property.
   (C)   Any private water wells and private sewer or septic systems shall be
sealed in the manner required by law within ninety (90) days after connection
of the property served by such private well or sewer system to the municipal
water or sewer system.
   (D)   No new private water wells and no new septic systems shall be
permitted in the village for any purpose unless no municipal water supply or
sewer system is reasonably available.
   (E)   Any person found to be in violation of any provision of this section
shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). Each violation, or day
said violation is permitted to continue, shall constitute a separate offense.

later than three hundred sixty five (365) days following the effective date of
this chapter.
      2.   Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is
discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for
"total" metal unless indicated otherwise. At his discretion, the superintendent
may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration
based above.
   (E)   Requirements: In any case, the most stringent requirement and
limitation of the following shall apply:
      1.   Federal discharge standards and national categorical pretreatment
standards as promulgated in federal legislation, rules and regulations
including, but not limited to, the act (PL 95-217), USEPA "general pretreatment
regulations for existing and new sources of pollution" (40 CFR part 403), and
categorical pretreatment regulations for various categories (40 CFR parts 410,
413, 414, 415, 419, 420, 421, 425, 429, 430, 433, 434, 439, 440, 444, 455, 463,

      2.   State discharge standards as promulgated in state legislation,
rules, and regulations including, but not limited to, "title 35: environmental
protection, subtitle C: water pollution control board".
      3.   Discharge standards contained in this chapter.
   (F)   KMU's Right Of Revision: KMU reserves the right to establish by
ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in subsection
6-6-1(A) of this chapter. Upon revision of this by the city, such revisions
shall automatically be incorporated into this chapter and be applicable to
users within the village of Manteno.
   (G)   Dilution: No user shall increase the use of process water or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (H)   Variances: Users seeking variances from subsection (D) of this section
may petition KMU for a variation from the standards in accordance with the
procedures set forth in subsection
6-6-5(L) of this chapter.
   (I)   Spill Containment:
      1.   Accidental Discharges: Each significant industrial user having the
ability to cause interference with the POTW or to violate the regulatory
provisions of this chapter shall provide protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the user's own cost and expense. All significant
industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include compatible or
incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause interference with the
POTW must have detailed plans on file with the utility showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection. Plans shall be approved by the
utility before users shall complete such a plan. No user who commences
contribution to or could contribute such pollutants to the POTW after the
effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into
the system until accidental discharge facilities and procedures have been
approved by the utility and installed by the user.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Immediate Notification: In the case of an accidental or deliberate
discharge of compatible or incompatible pollutants, which cause interference at
the POTW or violate requirements of this chapter, it shall be the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the
village of Manteno and KMU of the incident. The notification shall include name
of caller, location and time of discharge, type of wastewater, concentration,
volume, and corrective action taken.
      3.   Written Report: Within five (5) days following such an accidental or
deliberate discharge the industrial user shall submit to the superintendent a
detailed written report on forms to be provided by KMU, describing the cause of
the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Follow up reports may be required by KMU as needed. Such
report, or reports, shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss,
damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which
may be imposed by this chapter or otherwise. Failure to report accidental or
deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other remedies available to KMU,
result in the revocation of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.
      4.   Production Control: The industrial user shall control production or
all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all
applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment
facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment
is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost
or fails.
      5.   Notice To Employees: A notice in English and the language of common
use shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge of a prohibitive material. Employers shall ensure that all employees
who are in a position to cause, discover, or observe such an accidental
discharge are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
      6.   Additional Remedies: In addition to the remedies available to the
utility set forth elsewhere in this chapter, if the utility is fined by the
IEPA or USEPA for violation of the POTW's NPDES permit or violation of water
quality standards as the result of an industrial spill or intentional slug
discharge of a compatible or incompatible pollutant, then the fine, including
all utility legal, sampling, analytical testing, and any other related costs
shall be charged to the responsible industry. Such charge shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the utility may have under this
chapter, statutes, regulations, at law or in equity.
      7.   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans: At least once every two (2)
years, the superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial
user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The superintendent may
require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for every user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
         (a)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
         (b)   Description of stored chemicals;
         (c)   Procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsections (I)2 of this section
and
6-6-4(Q)5 of this chapter; and
         (d)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accident or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
      8.   Tenant Responsibility: Where an owner of property leases the
premises to any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement,
if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be
held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      9.   Hauled Wastewater:
         (a)   Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW only at a
designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area and at such
times as are established by the POTW. Such waste shall not violate this section
or any other requirements established by the city. The superintendent shall
require septic tank waste haulers to obtain waste hauler permits and to abide
by the POTW's waste hauler guidelines.

notice to the superintendent must include a written certification by the new
owner and/or operator which:
      1.   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to
change the facility's operations and processes.
      2.   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur.
      3.   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit voidable on the date of the facility transfer.
   (N)   Change In Conditions: In the event the type, quality or volume of
wastewater from the property for which a discharge permit was previously
granted is expected to materially and substantially change as reasonably
determined by the permittee or KMU, the permittee shall give a thirty (30) day
notice in writing to KMU and shall make a new application to KMU prior to said
change, in the same manner and form as originally made, provided that
information previously submitted and unchanged need not be resubmitted by
permittee. No permittee shall materially and substantially change the type,
quality or volume of its wastewater beyond that allowed by its permit without
prior approval of KMU.

not to exceed five (5) years. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a
minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of the user's
existing permit. Within ninety (90) days of notification, the user shall apply,
on a form provided by the POTW, for reissuance of the permit. The terms and
conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by KMU during the term
of the permit as limitations or requirements identified in section
6-6-2 of this chapter are modified or as other just causes exist. The user
shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty (30)
days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in
the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (P)   Plans And Specifications: Detailed plans and specifications prepared
by an Illinois registered professional engineer of the pretreatment facility
proposed to be constructed shall be submitted to KMU for review and must be
acceptable to KMU before construction of the facility is commenced. The review
of such plans shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying its facility as necessary to comply with this chapter. Within a
reasonable time after the completion of the wastewater treatment facility, the
user shall furnish its operations and maintenance procedures to KMU for review.
   (Q)   Reporting Requirements For Permittee:

            (4)   Flow Measurement: Information showing the measured average
daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated
process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined
waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
            (5)   Measurement Of Pollutants:
               A.   Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable
to each regulated process.
               B.   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the
nature and concentration and/or mass, where required by the standard or by KMU,
or regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Where
required, instantaneous daily maximum and long term average concentrations or
mass shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations
and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out by KMU.
               C.   Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures
set out by KMU.
            (6)   Certification: A statement reviewed by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional indicating
whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
            (7)   Compliance Schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by

pursuant to this schedule must meet the requirements set out in subsection (Q)9
of this section.
            (8)   Reports Signed And Certified: All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (G) of this section.
      2.   Reports On Compliance With Categorical Pretreatment Standard
Deadline: Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
within forty five (45) days following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and
pretreatment requirements shall submit to the superintendent, on forms provided
by KMU, a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in
the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment
standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these
process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment
standards and requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements are being met on a consistent basis
and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards and pretreatment requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the user, and certified to by a qualified
professional as defined in "general pretreatment regulations". All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (G) of this
section.
      3.   Periodic Compliance Reports:
         (a)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of such applicable pretreatment standards, or, in the case of a
new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to
the superintendent during the months of July and January, unless required more
frequently in the categorical pretreatment standard or by pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by such applicable pretreatment standards. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of
the superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high and low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent may agree to
alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
            (1)   Exceptions: Exception to this reporting requirement would be
for any significant user who does not perform self-monitoring on their
discharge. Instead, KMU performs the service of monitoring their discharge at
least twice a year. A compliance report is only required if the significant
user is regulated by mass based limitations.
         (b)   The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment
requirements, or in other cases, where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (Q)3(a)(1) of
this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the
superintendent, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the
applicable categorical pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standards. All analyses
shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the
administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the act and contained in 40 CFR
part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by
the superintendent. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques approved by the superintendent. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not
include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the EPA publication "Sampling And Analysis Procedures For Screening Of
Industrial Effluents For Priority Pollutants, April, 1977", analytical
procedures approved by the superintendent.
      4.   Late Filing Charge: Any user subject to the reporting requirements
set forth in the general pretreatment regulations 40 CFR 403 or its industrial
wastewater discharge permit as issued in accordance with subsection (I) of this
section must file their report within thirty (30) days after receipt of the
proper reporting form and sampling data from KMU. Extensions of this time
period may be granted by the superintendent upon written request by the user.
Failure to comply with this provision will result in a fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00). Additional fines will be issued at thirty (30) day intervals
until the report is properly filed or a time extension is granted by the
superintendent. Repeated or continued failure to comply with this provision is
grounds for enforcement.
      5.   Report Of Potential Problems:
         (a)   In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems
for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in
subsection
6-6-2(A) of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to
immediately telephone and notify KMU of the incident. This notification shall
include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
The following procedures shall be followed:
            (1)   Accidental discharges that contain pollutants that exceed the
permitted limit by ten (10) times shall be reported.
            (2)   Accidental discharges that may cause permanent damage to the
collection or treatment system shall be reported immediately. These discharges
include, but are not limited to, pollutants that may cause a fire or explosion
hazard in the collection system, pH of 2 or less or 12.5 or greater for longer
than ten (10) minutes, any pollutant that will increase the concentration in
the influent to the POTW enough to have a decrease in treatment efficiency.
            (3)   During normal business hours (7:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.), the
permittee shall notify KMU by telephone at 933-0446. At all times, KMU should
be notified by leaving a message with KMU's twenty four (24) hour dispatch at
933-0446 after four o'clock (4:00) P.M., Monday through Friday, or weekend and
holidays. The notification shall include the name of the person making the
call, the telephone number where said person can be reached, location of
discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, including concentration, and
volume and corrective action taken.
            (4)   The party making the call shall be available by phone for a
minimum of fifteen (15) minutes after the notification is made. This is so that
a member of KMU may contact the industry representative for more information,
if necessary.
         (b)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial
user shall, unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measure to be taken by
the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed by this chapter.
         (c)   Failure to notify KMU of potential problem discharges shall be
deemed a separate violation of this chapter.
         (d)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described in subsection (Q)5(a) of this section. Employers
shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to
occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
      6.   Reports From Nonsignificant Industrial Users: All industrial users
not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to KMU as the
superintendent may require.
      7.   Notice Of Violation/Repeat Sampling And Reporting: If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must
notify the control authority within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to KMU within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to
resample if KMU performs monitoring at the industrial user's at least once a
month, or if KMU performs sampling between the industrial user's initial
sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
      8.   Notification Of The Discharge Of Hazardous Waste:
         (a)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of
the hazardous constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later
than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this subsection (Q)8(a) need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under subsection (Q)5 of this section. The notification
requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of subsections (Q)1, (Q)2 and (Q)3 of this section.
         (b)   Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (Q)8
(a) of this section, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more
than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a onetime notification. Subsequent months
during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous
waste do not require additional notification.
         (c)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of the
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
superintendent, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, the
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
         (d)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
         (e)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
      9.   Compliance Schedule Progress Report: The following condition shall
apply to the schedule required by this subsection (Q). The schedule shall
contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events including hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting route
operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months. The
industrial user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent no later
than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and if appropriate the steps
being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no
event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to
the superintendent.
   (R)   Analytical Requirements: All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA.
      1.   Sample Collection:
         (a)   Except as indicated in subsection (R)1(b) of this section, the
user must collect wastewater samples using composite collection techniques. In
the event composite sampling is infeasible, the superintendent may authorize
the use of a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that
this will provide a representative sample of the effluent discharged. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
discharge limits.
         (b)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenol,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      2.   Timing: Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States postal service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
      3.   Record Keeping: Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and
the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques of methods
used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available
for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city or
where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
superintendent.
   (S)   Monitoring Facilities:
      1.   Provision And Location: KMU shall require to be provided and
operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. Where required by KMU, additional control manholes or sampling
chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an
industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with
pretreatment standards. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on
the user's premises, but KMU may, when such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user. However, before
a monitoring facility may be located in the public street or sidewalk area, the
user must seek and obtain permission from the village of Manteno.
      2.   Sampling Chamber:
         (a)   Whenever required by KMU, the owner of any property serviced by
a building sewer carrying nonresidential wastewater shall install a large
manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the building sewer
in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the superintendent,
installed and maintained at all times at user's expense, which shall have ample
room in each sampling chamber to permit KMU to take accurate composite samples
for analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily and independently accessible
to authorized representatives of KMU.
         (b)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flow measuring device
which is approved by KMU with a recording and totalizing register for
measurement of the liquid quantity; or at the discretion of KMU, the metered
water supply to the industrial plant may be used as the liquid quantity where
it is substantiated to the superintendent that the metered water supply and
waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment
agreed to by KMU is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid
waste quantity.
         (c)   When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour,
as determined by KMU and properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance with
"standard methods" as defined herein and shall be composed in proportion to the
flow for a representative twenty four (24) hour sample. Such sampling shall be
done as prescribed by KMU.
         (d)   The frequency for sampling, sampling chamber, metering device,
sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any time, to
inspection and verification by KMU.
      3.   Monitoring Facilities: Each industrial user whose wastewater
discharge(s) has by sampling of wastewater or other means of inspection been
found to contain or have the potential to contain incompatible priority
pollutants in amounts or concentration which may cause interference with the
wastewater utility system process or operation, shall provide and maintain at
all times, a monitoring facility at each applicable building sewer discharge
which will allow for inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the discharge
to the POTW sewer line. Such monitoring facility shall be provided and
maintained by the user of each building sewer discharge, which contains or has
the potential to contain incompatible priority pollutants.
         (a)   The monitoring facilities shall be located on the industrial
user's premises, provided that if such location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship to the industrial user, KMU may allow the facility to be
constructed in a public street or sidewalk area with the expressed permission
of the village of Manteno. Said facility shall be located so that samples may
be taken safety and easily and shall not be obstructed by landscaping, parked
vehicles or other activities of the industrial user.
         (b)   Monitoring facilities located in public streets or sidewalks
shall not obstruct the flow of traffic. All monitoring facilities must meet all
local and KMU construction codes and must be approved by KMU and the village of
Manteno prior to construction.
         (c)   There shall be ample room in and near such monitoring facilities
to allow accurate sampling and monitoring equipment to be installed and to
prepare samples for analysis. Such facilities shall be accessible to authorized
representatives of KMU at all times upon presentation of suitable
identification provided that authorized representatives of KMU personnel shall
under exceptional circumstances have access upon presentation of suitable
identification at any time discharges are occurring.
         (d)   The entrance or manhole to such monitoring facilities shall be
secured by a breakaway key type locking device installed by KMU. KMU shall have
the only key to said locking device and have complete control of access to the
monitoring facility. When required during the weekday hours of seven o'clock
(7:00) A.M. to four o'clock (4:00) P.M. by an industrial user, KMU personnel
shall be available to open the monitoring facilities on ninety (90) minute
notice upon good cause shown. Alternative means of adequately securing such
monitoring facilities may be approved by the superintendent. This determination
shall be made when requested by the industrial user.
         (e)   The monitoring facilities shall contain the following equipment
installed in a permanently fixed position by the industrial user:
            (1)   A flow measuring device incorporated into the invert with
approval by KMU.
            (2)   A source of electrical power to the monitoring facilities of
sufficient voltage and amperage to operate all equipment in the sampling
chamber. An appropriate device shall be installed by user to indicate a power
failure and length of time of such failure. Such device shall be specified by
KMU and furnished by user.
         (f)   Automatic composite sampling devices provided by KMU shall be
installed and operated in the monitoring facility on a twenty four (24) hour
basis seven (7) days per week. Samples will be collected by KMU personnel five
(5) days per week and analyzed on a routine basis. KMU will provide a split of
each sample taken from said monitoring facility upon written request of the
industrial user.
      4.   Inspection And Sampling: KMU may inspect the facilities of any user
to ascertain compliance with this chapter. Persons or occupants of the premises
where a discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are
kept shall allow KMU or its representative ready access upon presentation of
credentials at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and photocopying of records
required to be kept by this chapter or in the performance of any of their
duties.
   KMU, IEPA, USEPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspections, compliance monitoring
and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which
would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards
so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from KMU, IEPA,
USEPA, will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing its specific responsibilities. Such arrangements shall be made by
users with their security guards within thirty (30) days of the passage of this
chapter.
   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in
this chapter, the duly authorized KMU personnel shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises established by the company, and the company shall be
held harmless for injury or death to KMU and KMU indemnify the user against
loss or damage to its property by KMU employees and against liability claims
and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company
and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be
caused by negligence for failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
   KMU and industrial users shall maintain records of all information resulting
from any monitoring activities required by this chapter and shall include:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the names
of the person or persons taking the samples;
         (b)   The dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analyses;
         (d)   The analytical techniques/methods used; and
         (e)   The results of such analyses.
   KMU and industrial users shall maintain such records for a minimum of three
(3) years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any
unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by the industrial
user or operation of KMU's pretreatment program or when requested by the
regional administrator or the director of IEPA.
      5.   Right Of Entry; Inspection And Sampling: The superintendent shall
have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user
is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the superintendent ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
         (a)   Where the user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted
to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
         (b)   The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
         (c)   The superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy.
         (d)   Any temporary or permanent obstructions to safe and easy access
to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
         (e)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
      6.   Search Warrants: If the superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with
this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the superintendent may
seek issuance of a search warrant from the Kankakee County court.
      7.   Pretreatment: Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
applicable pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by
regulations, statutes, and ordinances. Any facility required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to KMU shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to KMU for review, and
shall be acceptable to KMU and IEPA before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to KMU under the provisions of this chapter. The user shall
obtain all necessary construction and operating permits from IEPA. Such
pretreatment facilities shall be under the control and direction of an IEPA
certified industrial wastewater treatment plant operator. Within a reasonable
time after the completion of the pretreatment facility, the user shall furnish
its operations and maintenance procedures to KMU for review. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to KMU prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
   All records relating to compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
shall be made available to the approval authority upon request.
      8.   Confidential Information: Information and data relating to an
industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be
available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the superintendent that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user under applicable state law. Copies of information
from KMU files shall be provided to persons so requesting upon payment of a
copy fee established by KMU.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, and until such time as the
information is determined not to be confidential by agreement between KMU and
the user, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret
processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall
be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this chapter, the national pollutant discharge elimination system
(NPDES) permit, and the pretreatment programs, provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state
agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Information and data provided to KMU which is effluent
data shall be available to the public without restriction.
   Information accepted by KMU as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any
governmental agency by KMU until and unless a thirty (30) day notification is
given to the user.
   KMU shall implement measures to prevent the negligent release of
confidential information; however, neither KMU, the village of Manteno nor
their employees shall be held legally responsible for release of information if
they have acted in good faith.
      9.   Publication Of Users In Significant Noncompliance: The
superintendent shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published
in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of users which, during
the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall mean:
         (a)   "Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits", defined
herein as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of wastewater
measurements taken during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit
or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
         (b)   "Technical review criteria (TRC) violations", defined herein as
those in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements
taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equal or
exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied
by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2
for all other pollutants except pH);
         (c)   Any other discharge violation that the superintendent believes
has caused, along or in combination with other discharges, interference or
pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general
public;
         (d)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
         (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date,
a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
         (f)   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date,
any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on
compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-
monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
         (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
         (h)   Any other violation(s) which the superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
      10.   Sludges Generated: Sludges, floats, skimmings, etc., generated by
an industrial or commercial pretreatment system shall not be placed into the
POTW. Such sludges shall be contained, transported, and disposed of by haulers
in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations.
   In special cases where such sludges may be compatible with the POTW
treatment system, the superintendent may accept, for a charge, a particular
sludge to be placed into the POTW in a particular method.
   Sludges shall only be delivered between seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. and three
thirty o'clock (3:30) P.M.
   A representative sample of each load of sludge shall be taken by POTW
personnel. The sample shall be split and a portion of it shall be given to the
industrial user if so requested, in writing. The sample shall be analyzed for
compatible pollutants in accordance with standard methods. The superintendent
may alter the frequency of sampling and the extent of the analysis if the
characteristics of sludge from a particular user are found to be consistent and
not variable.
   The POTW reserves the right to discontinue acceptance of sludges at any
time, for any duration, without notice. (Ord. 06-70, 2-20-2007)
6-6-5: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES:
The city of Kankakee shall be the entity with charge of enforcing this chapter
pursuant to its home rule powers and jurisdiction. The provisions of this
chapter are in repetition of those passed by the city of Kankakee, pursuant to
its home rule powers, in its utility ordinance. The provisions in the city's
utility ordinance are made applicable to users within the village of Manteno by
and through this chapter. Where any provision in this chapter is found to be
legislation not within the governmental powers or affairs of the village of
Manteno or preempted, the provisions of the city's utility ordinance shall be
applicable to users in the village of Manteno pursuant to its home rule powers
and jurisdiction.
   (A)   Notification Of Violation: When the superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may serve upon that
user a written notice of violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
this notice, the user shall submit an explanation of the violation and a plan
for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, to the superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
   (B)   Administrative Proceedings: Whenever the superintendent determines
that wastewater is being or has been discharged into the POTW, and when, in the
opinion of the superintendent, such discharge violates this chapter, the
superintendent shall by conference, conciliation or persuasion, make a
reasonable effort to eliminate or remedy such violation. If these efforts have
been unsuccessful, the superintendent shall use an administrative enforcement
remedy.
   (C)   Consent Orders: The superintendent may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such document shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections
of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (D)   Show Cause Hearing:
      1.   Notice Of Hearing: The superintendent may request a show cause
hearing. The city through its city council may order any user who causes or
allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
   The city council may itself order the hearing or may designate any of its
members or officers or employees to order the hearing. A notice shall be served
on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city
council or its designated person, the reasons why the action is to be taken,
the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause before
the city council or its designated person why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of hearing shall be served personally or be
mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten
(10) days before the hearing. The notice of the hearing may be served on any
agent or officer of a corporation. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
      2.   Hearing Officials: The city council or its designated person may
itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence to:
         (a)   Issue, in the name of the city council, notices of hearing,
request the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and request the production
of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings;
         (b)   Take the evidence;
         (c)   Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city
council for action thereon.
      3.   Transcripts: At any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, testimony
taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to
the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
      4.   Issuance Of Orders: After the city council or its designated person
has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for
the discharge directing either: a) that the discharge permit be revoked and the
service be disconnected or b) that following a specified time the permit shall
be revoked and sewer service discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and operated
properly to comply with the discharge permit or c) direct the user to cease the
unauthorized discharge effective after a specified period of time or d) that
such other relief as deemed necessary by the POTW to abate the discharge be
granted. Further orders and directives as are necessary may be issued.
   (E)   Compliance Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of
liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
   (F)   Emergency Suspensions: The superintendent may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      1.   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event a user fails to immediately
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in subsection (I) of this section are initiated against
the user.
      2.   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment, shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under subsection (D) or (I) of this section.
   (G)   Cease And Desist Orders: When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to reoccur, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
      1.   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      2.   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (H)   Administrative Fines:
      1.   When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues
to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) a day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per
day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits,
fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violations.
      2.   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30)
calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the
unpaid balance and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent
(10%) per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      3.   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine
amount within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
      4.   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (I)   Revocation Of Wastewater Discharge Permit: Any user who violates this
chapter, or applicable state and federal regulations, or the following, is
subject to having his permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of this
section:
      1.   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge as determined by the user's or KMU's
analysis;
      2.   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      3.   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises by USEPA, IEPA,
or KMU's representatives for the purpose of inspection and monitoring;
      4.   Tampering with, disrupting, or destroying KMU equipment as
determined by KMU, by a preponderance of evidence which determination shall be
final;
      5.   Failure to report an accidental discharge of a pollutant in a
reportable quantity;
      6.   Failure to report an upset of the user's pretreatment facilities;
      7.   Violation of the conditions of its permit;
      8.   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in
the wastewater discharge permit application;
      9.   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
      10.   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      11.   Failure to pay fines;
      12.   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      13.   Failure to meet compliance schedules; or
      14.   Failure to complete a wastewater survey, or any other required
report.
   (J)   Harmful Contributions: Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, KMU may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion
of KMU, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment or which threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW or
causes the POTW to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or
the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
contribution. In the event of a failure of the user to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, KMU shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW system or endangerment to any individual. KMU may reinstate the
wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to KMU
within fifteen (15) days of the date of the occurrence.
   (K)   Legal Action: Notwithstanding any other sections of this chapter, if
any user discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the sanitary
sewers contrary to the provisions of this chapter, federal or state
pretreatment requirements, or any order of KMU, the corporation council may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the
Kankakee County circuit court.
   (L)   Variances:
      1.   Authority: To the extent consistent with the applicable provisions
of the act and the Illinois environmental protection act 1 , KMU may grant
individual variances beyond the limitations prescribed in subsection
6-6-2(D), "Specific Pollutant Limitations", of this chapter, provided that the
petitioner has demonstrated that the failure to receive a variance would work
an arbitrary or unreasonable hardship on the petitioner and provided further
that petitioner has demonstrated that it will be in compliance by the end of
the variance period granted. The burden of showing such arbitrary and
unreasonable hardship shall be on petitioner who shall, before such variance is
granted, show such arbitrary and unreasonable hardship to KMU by clear and
convincing proof. In no case shall KMU grant any variance whose terms might or
could cause "interference" or "pass-through" as such terms are defined in this
chapter.
      2.   Conditions And Duration: In granting a variance, KMU may impose such
conditions, exceptions, time limitations, duration and other limitations as the
policies of this chapter, the Illinois environmental protection act and the act
may require, including limitations that will assure that the petitioner will be
in compliance by the end of the variance period. Any variance granted by KMU
shall not exceed two (2) years and shall be granted upon the condition that the
person who receives such variance shall make such periodic progress twice for
up to two (2) years each time by affirmative action of KMU but only if
satisfactory progress has been shown. However, no petitioner shall receive any
variances, including any extension, exceeding a combined total of five (5)
years for any specific pollutant.
      3.   Petition And Hearing: Any person seeking a variance shall do so by
filing a petition for variance with the superintendent on forms provided by
KMU. Within twenty one (21) days of receipt of the petition, notice of the
petition shall be published in "The Daily Journal".
KMU shall specify information required to be submitted by the petitioner. To
enable KMU to rule on the petition for variance, the following information,
where applicable, shall be included in the petition:
         (a)   A clear and complete statement of the precise extent of relief
sought, including specific identification of the particular provisions of this
chapter from which the variance is sought;
         (b)   Data describing the nature and extent of the present failure to
meet the numerical standards or particular provisions from which the variance
is sought and a factual statement why compliance with this chapter was not or
cannot be achieved by the required compliance date;
         (c)   A detailed description of the existing and proposed equipment or
proposed method of control to be undertaken to achieve full compliance with
this chapter, including a time schedule for the implementation of all phases of
the control program from initiation of design to program completion and
estimated costs involved for each phase and the total cost to achieve
compliance;
         (d)   Past efforts to achieve compliance including costs incurred,
results achieved and permit status;
         (e)   A discussion of the availability of alternate methods of
compliance, the extent that such methods were studies, and the comparative
factors leading to the selection of the control program proposed to achieve
compliance;
         (f)   A concise factual statement of the reasons the petitioner
believes that compliance with the particular provisions of this chapter would
impose an arbitrary or unreasonable hardship; and
         (g)   Such other things as are required by KMU.
      4.   Time Limit For Action By KMU: The superintendent shall investigate
such petition, consider the views of persons who might be adversely affected by
the granting of a variance and make a report to KMU with a recommendation as to
the disposition of the petition. If KMU in its discretion concludes that a
hearing would be advisable or if KMU or any other person files a written
objection to the granting of such variance within fifteen (15) days from the
date of publication of the petition in "The Daily Journal", then a hearing
shall be held under the provisions of subsection (D) of this section. The
burden of proof shall be on the petitioner.
      5.   Violation: If the limits of a variance are exceeded or if any terms
of a variance are violated by the person granted a variance, a violation of
this chapter is deemed to have occurred, and the variance may be revoked on
thirty (30) days' notice.
   (M)   Appeal Procedures: In the event a user is dissatisfied with permit
conditions, enforcement procedures, or sampling procedures established or used
by KMU as it applies to his discharge to the sanitary sewer, except as such
dissatisfaction relates to proceeding under subsections (A) through (J) of this
section, that user shall seek relief through the use of the following
administrative procedures. The procedure outlined herein is voluntary, and
shall not act as a bar or condition precedent to KMU's use of any remedies
provided herein. So that problems or disputes may be resolved on the lowest
practicable level, the procedures outlined below shall be followed in order.
      1.   Initial Review Of Complaint: User shall contact KMU with its
complaint or questions, and shall be referred to the appropriate department for
initial screening; where the problem is routine in nature or requires only
explanation, no further action will be taken.
      2.   Manager's Review: Where a user is not satisfied with the response
given by the appropriate department, the complaint or question shall be reduced
to writing and referred to management personnel to be assigned by the
superintendent for review. The management personnel so designated shall review
the file and consult with the user in an effort to resolve the problem. If the
matter can be resolved to the user's satisfaction at this level, no further
action will be required.
      3.   Superintendent's Review: If the review and discussion between the
management personnel and the user do not resolve the matter, a report on the
complaint, together with the manager's recommendations, will be forwarded to
the superintendent for his consideration and decision. If the decision of the
superintendent resolves the matter, no further action will be required.
In the case of a user protesting a permit condition(s), the user must file a
petition for an appeal no later than ten (10) days after the date of issuance
of the permit. If the appeal is timely, an informal hearing with the
superintendent shall be scheduled. The user shall be given an opportunity to
present his case with evidence and/or expert opinion as to why the conditions
of his permit should be changed. The superintendent shall issue a written
decision on the appeal. If the superintendent's decision resolves the matter,
no further action will be required.
      4.   City Council's Review: If the findings and actions by the
superintendent do not satisfy the user, the entire file, together with
recommendations from the superintendent, shall be given to the city council,
which, after review of the file and recommendations of the superintendent,
shall meet with the user and review the complaint. Following the review of the
file and discussion with the user, the city council will make a final decision
on the matter.
In the case of a user protesting the superintendent's decision of an appeal of
a permit condition(s), the user must file a second petition for appeal no later
than ten (10) days after the date of receipt of the superintendent's written
decision. The city council will schedule a formal hearing after reviewing the
file and recommendations of the superintendent. The user shall be given an
opportunity to present his case with evidence and/or expert opinion as to why
the conditions of his permit should be changed. The city council shall issue a
formal decision which shall be published in the official minutes of the
hearing.
   (N)   Upsets:
      1.   As A Defense For Noncompliance: An upset shall constitute an
affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards if the industrial user who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
specific cause(s) of the upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures;
         (c)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
KMU within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5
days):
            (1)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            (2)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue.
            (3)   Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
      2.   Burden Of Proof: In any enforcement proceeding the industrial user
seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      3.   User Responsibility In Case Of Upset: The industrial user shall
control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with all applicable regulations upon reduction, loss, or failure of
its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method
of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where,
among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is
reduced, lost or fails. (Ord. 06-70, 2-20-2007)

6-7-1: PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities in rights-of-way within the Village’s
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole while balancing the Village’s desire
to modernize and futureproof critical infrastructure which must be built in
and/or exist in the Village’s rights-of-way for the Village to continue to
prosper and be a place its residents want to live.
   (B)   Intent: In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities and wireless providers, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility and
wireless facilities, including without limitation:
      1.   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      2.   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      3.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village’s utilities and of other utilities or wireless facilities lawfully
located in rights-of-way or public property;
      4.   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility and wireless facilities;
      5.   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      6.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      7.   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village’s residential neighborhoods;
      8.   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way through limiting any components of new systems to being
constructed below ground unless added to an existing utility pole (excluding
decorative light poles); and
      9.   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to facilities’ locations.
   (C)   Facilities Subject To This Chapter: This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility or wireless provider as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable
franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities or wireless providers
to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of
locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within the Village rights-of-way. Utilities or wireless providers that are not
required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the Village
enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the Village may provide for
terms and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
   (E)   Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
      1.   Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that
a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      2.   Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      3.   Wireless Providers: Existing agreements between the Village and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village’s utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
      A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the Village on
the effective date of the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act, PA 100-
0585, may accept the rates, fees and terms that the Village has currently
adopted for the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of
new utility poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the
subject of an application submitted two (2) or more years after the effective
date of the Act by notifying the Village that it opts to accept such rates,
fees and terms. The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable
termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider
has collocated on the Village’s utility poles pursuant to applications
submitted to the Village before the wireless provider provides such notice and
exercises its option under this paragraph.
   (F)   Conflicts With Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts With State And Federal Laws: In the event that applicable
Federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility or wireless provider shall comply with the requirements of
this chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating Federal or State
laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound Engineering Judgment: The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)

additional one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each small wireless facility
beyond five (5) and (b) two hundred seventy dollars ($270.00) per small
wireless facility per year for all recurring fees, including any possible ROW
access fee or fee for attachment to municipally-owned structures in the ROW,
and (c) one thousand dollars ($1,000) for non-recurring fees for a new pole.
The Village desires to offer permit applicants the ability to amend
applications when appropriate (as opposed to requiring new applications for
permit edits). At the Village’s discretion, when appropriate, the Village will
consider when an amendment can be made rather than requiring a new application.
      2.   The Village will not impose fees on wireless service providers for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with section
6-7-9 of this chapter; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
   (C)   Required Application Fee: Notwithstanding any contrary provision of
State law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this chapter shall be
accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be
nonrefundable. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-6: ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS:
   (A)   Village Review Of Utility Permit Applications: Completed permit
applications for utility facilities which contain all required documentation,
shall be examined by the Superintendent of Public Works within a reasonable
time after filing. If the application does not conform to the requirements of
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent
of Public Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor. If the Superintendent of Public Works is satisfied that the proposed
work conforms to the requirements of this chapter and applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Superintendent of Public Works shall
issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances, it shall be
the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent of Public Works that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Telecommunications
Retailers:
      1.   Pursuant to section 4 of the Telephone Company Act 1 , a
telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Superintendent of Public Works
shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      2.   In the event that the Superintendent of Public Works fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either: a) ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or b) twenty five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
   (C)   Should the telecommunications retailer commence work without obtaining
a permit under this chapter, they must first follow standard procedure for
locating existing utilities before beginning any underground construction, up
to and including potholing (small diameter vacuum excavation) to determine
precise depth and location of existing buried facilities. The
telecommunications retailer should then provide the Village with as-built
documentation for the Village’s records
      1.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to section
6-7-4 of this chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (A) of this
section.
   (D)   Additional Village Review Of Applications Of Holders Of State
Authorization Under The Cable And Video Competition Law Of 2007: Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty five (45) days
after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village,
provided the holder has complied with applicable Village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
   (E)   Processing Wireless Facility Applications: The Village shall process
applications for wireless facilities as follows:
      1.   Prioritization: The first completed application shall have priority
over applications received by different wireless facility applicants for
collocation on the same utility pole or wireless support structure.
      2.   Application Completion: Within thirty (30) days after receiving an
application, the Village shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the Village must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the Village’s permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the
Village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides
the missing information.
      3.   Existing Poles Or Structures (including Collocation of Wireless
Facilities): An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the Village fails to
approve or deny the application within sixty (60) days after the submission of
a completed application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no
sooner than seventy five (75) days after the submission of a completed
application. The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day
after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt
of the deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed
approved notice shall not preclude the Village’s denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this section. An Application to
collocate facilities other than a small wireless facility on an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement thereof shall be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the
Village fails to approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days. The
other stipulations of this paragraph apply respectively and at the Village’s
discretion.
      4.   New Utility Poles or Structures (Including Construction of New
Wireless Facilities): An application to collocate a small wireless facility
that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a
nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the Village fails to approve or
deny the application within ninety (90) days after the submission of a
completed application. However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the
permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the
Village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no
sooner than one hundred five (105) days after the submission of a completed
application. The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day
after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt
of the deemed approved notice by the Village. The receipt of the deemed
approved notice shall not preclude the Village’s denial of the permit request
within the time limits as provided under this section. An Application to
construct wireless facilities other than a small wireless facility on an
existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement thereof
shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if
the Village fails to approve or deny the application within one hundred fifty
(150) days. The other stipulations of this paragraph apply respectively and at
the Village’s discretion.
      5.   Application Denied: The Village shall deny an application which does
not meet the requirements of this chapter. If the Village determines that
applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the
requirements of section
6-7-9 of this chapter, require that the utility pole or wireless support
structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be
conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support
structure at the cost of the provider.
      The Village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific
code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and
send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies
an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the
Village and resubmit the revised application once within thirty (30) days after
notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional
application fee. The Village shall approve or deny the revised application
within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is
deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within thirty (30)
days of denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with
applicable fees, and result in recommencement of the Village’s review period.
      The applicant must notify the Village in writing of its intention to
proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be
submitted with the revised application. Any review of a revised application
shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial, except in cases in
which the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different
structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment
associated with the small wireless facility.
      6.   No part of any system can be installed on any pole owned by the
Village of Manteno. Siting and design of infrastructure on other poles in the
Village will be required to be reviewed by the Village for safety and
aesthetics.
      7.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         (b)   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-
2024)
6-7-7: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration Of Utility Facility Permits: No permit issued to a utility
under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Duration Of Small Wireless Facility Permits: For permits to collocate
small wireless facilities, the collocation must be complete within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the issuance of the permit, unless the Village and the
wireless provider agree to extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready
work for a Municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or
backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a
timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for
commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete
installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of
the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the Village grants an
extension in writing to the applicant.
      Wireless facility permits which meet the collocation requirements of the
preceding paragraph shall be for a period of not less than five (5) years, and
the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the Village makes a
finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole
do not comply with the applicable Village codes or any provision, condition or
requirement contained in this chapter.
   (D)   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the Village with the Director of Public
Works and the Village Engineer, plus Village representatives in attendance who
the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing
the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in
the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or
absence of other facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to
avoid disruption of other facilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (E)   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-8: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans
shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated
as a request for variance in accordance with section
6-7-23 of this chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
   (A)   Whether the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material
respect from the locations identified in the plans, this documentation should
be provided to the Village not just in the form of revised drawings, but in a
shapefile or other GIS format ingestible by the Village’s GIS department/team,
and physical assets (particularly for underground construction) should be
precisely geolocated using engineering grade GPS equipment. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-
2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-9: COLLOCATION OF WIRELESS FACILITIES:
The following requirements and conditions shall apply only to collocation of
wireless facilities, as defined by this chapter:
   (A)   Permitted Use: No wireless facilities will be allowed on Village owned
poles. Installations on other infrastructure will follow the following
guidelines.
   (B)   Public Safety Space Reservation: The Village reserves space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the Village’s
electric utility uses, or both.
   (C)   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in a safe condition
and in good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of
this chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
   (D)   Make-Ready Requirements: No wireless facilities will be allowed on
Village owned poles.
   (E)   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider’s operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency’s communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC’s regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The Village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal
Regulations. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall
constitute a public nuisance.
   (F)   Electric Distribution Or Transmission Systems: Wireless facilities
will not interfere with electric distribution or transmission systems in any
way.
   (G)   Public Safety: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable
codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
   (H)   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that provide reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic
requirements that are set forth in any Village ordinance, written policy
adopted by the Village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that
applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic
landmark or in a historic district. Installation on decorative poles itself is
strictly prohibited within the Village and is not permissible to providers.
   (I)   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this section, a wireless
provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any
specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to
collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with
respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility
associated with a new utility pole, the Village may propose that the small
wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred feet (100') of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
      If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the Village, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.
   (J)   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
      New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which
small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
      1.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the Village, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the Village, provided the Village may designate
which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the
proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height
limitation for such facility; or
      2.   Forty-five feet (45') above ground level.
   (K)   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height for
a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which
the small wireless facility has proposed for collocation, the applicant shall
apply for a variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set
forth in section
6-7-23 of this chapter.
   (L)   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a
private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable
to utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
(Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-10: INSURANCE:
   (A)   Required Coverages And Limits For Utilities: Unless otherwise provided
by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying rights-of-
way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain
the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named
insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed
in subsections (A)1 and (A)2 of this section:
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products- completed operations coverage
with limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      3.   Workers’ compensation with statutory limits; and
      4.   Employer’s liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident.
      If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Required Coverages And Limits For Wireless Providers: Wireless
providers shall carry, at the wireless provider’s own cost and expense, the
following insurance:
      1.   Property insurance for its property’s replacement cost against all
risks;
      2.   Workers’ compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      3.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village right-of-way to afford minimum protection limits as
described in subsection (A)1. of this section.
      The wireless provider shall include the Village as an additional insured
on the commercial general liability policy and provide certification and
documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial general liability
policy prior to the collocation of any small wireless facility.
   (C)   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (D)   Copies Required: The utility or wireless provider shall provide copies
of any of the policies required by this section to the Village within ten (10)
days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.
   (E)   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages:
      1.   The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the
following endorsement:
         It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village President of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.
      2.   Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice,
and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the
utility or wireless provider shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence
of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
   (F)   Self-Insurance: A utility or wireless provider may self- insure all or
a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under this
section. A utility or wireless provider that self-insures is not required, to
the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the
naming of additional insureds under this section. A utility or wireless
provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self- insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under subsections (A) and (B) of this
section, such as evidence that the utility or wireless provider is a “private
self-insurer” under the Workers’ Compensation Act.
   (G)   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility’s Or Wireless
Provider’s Liability: The legal liability of the utility or wireless provider
to the Village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of
the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be
limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any
amounts thereunder.
   (H)   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
(Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-11: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility or
wireless provider shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the
Village and its elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or wireless
provider or their affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-
way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such
acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility’s
or wireless provider’s indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out
of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by
the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
(Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-12: SECURITY:
   (A)   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee’s sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Documented permit costs that are greater than permit fees, including
permit review and inspections by third party vendors (if and when needed);
      3.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee’s failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      4.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee’s failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee’s election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of
Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, and may also
include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are
likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where
the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Superintendent
of Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee
to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of
the construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for any single phase. It
may be necessary for the Village to hire a third-party vendor. If that is the
case, the anticipated cost for that service is an estimated $2/linear foot (LF)
for each review. If applicable, the applicant will be liable for any cost
exceeding this estimate. The amount withdrawn from the Security Fund will be
the actual of the cost incurred.
   (D)   Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days’ advance written
notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund,
provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security
Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in
subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such

right-of-way without the prior written approval of the Superintendent of Public
Works. When such storage is permitted, all pipe, conduit, wire, poles, cross
arms, or other materials shall be distributed along the right-of-way prior to
and during installation in a manner to minimize hazards to the public or an
obstacle to right-of-way maintenance or damage to the right-of- way and other
property. If material is to be stored on the right- of-way, prior approval must
be obtained from the Village.
      3.   Hazardous Materials: The plans submitted by the utility or wireless
provider to the Village shall identify any hazardous materials that may be
involved in the construction of the new facilities or removal of any existing
facilities.
   (D)   Operational Restrictions:
      1.   Construction operations on rights-of-way may, at the discretion of
the Village, be required to be discontinued when such operations would create
hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and welfare. Such operations
may also be required to be discontinued or restricted when conditions are such
that construction would result in extensive damage to the right-of-way or other
property.
      2.   These restrictions may be waived by the Superintendent of Public
Works when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.
      3.   Unless otherwise permitted by the Village, the hours of construction
are those set forth in this Code.
   (E)   Location Of Existing Facilities: Any utility or wireless provider
proposing to construct facilities in the Village shall contact JULIE and
ascertain the presence and location of existing above-ground and underground
facilities within the rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities.
The Village will make its permit records available to a utility or wireless
provider for the purpose of identifying possible facilities. When notified of
an excavation or when requested by the Village or by JULIE, a utility or
wireless provider shall locate and physically mark its underground facilities
within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding weekends and holidays, in accordance

activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the Village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other Utilities Or Wireless Providers; Tree Trimming Permit Required:
Tree trimming that is done by any other utility or wireless provider with
facilities in the right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable
Illinois laws and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be
considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application
for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required
under this chapter.
      1.   Application For Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming
permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      2.   Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.
   (D)   Chemical Use:
      1.   Except as provided in the following paragraph, no utility or
wireless provider shall spray, inject or pour any chemicals on or near any
trees, shrubs or vegetation in the Village for any purpose, including the
control of growth, insects or disease.
      2.   Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals will not be
permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility or wireless provider demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Public Works that such spraying is
the only practicable method of vegetation control. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd.
Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-20: REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF FACILITIES:
   (A)   Notice: Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the
Village, a utility or wireless provider shall, at its own expense, protect,
support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or
alter the position of any utility or wireless facilities within the rights-of-
way whenever the Corporate Authorities have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction,
repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement in or upon, or
the operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, any utility or wireless provider that owns,
controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances
within the rights- of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of
such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way. A facility is
unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee’s license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee’s license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency Removal Or Relocation Of Facilities: The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the Municipality shall attempt to notify the utility or
wireless provider, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall
notify the utility or wireless provider, if known, after cutting or removing a
facility.
   (D)   Wireless Provider Options Upon Removal Of A Village Utility Pole: The
Village may eliminate above-ground utility poles as long as such decision is
made on a nondiscriminatory basis. In the event the Village chooses to
eliminate a utility pole upon which a small wireless facility is collocated,
the Village will either: 1) install and maintain a reasonable alternative
utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of the small
wireless facility; 2) offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider
at a reasonable cost; or 3) allow the wireless provider to install its own
utility pole so it can maintain serviced from that location.
   (E)   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the Village, the utility or wireless provider shall notify the
Village within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the Village
may direct the utility or wireless provider to remove all or any portion of the
facility if the Superintendent of Public Works determines that such removal
will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the
event that the Village does not direct the utility or wireless provider that
abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the
Village, the abandoning utility or wireless provider shall be deemed to consent
to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another
utility or person.
   (F)   Small Wireless Facilities; Deemed Abandoned: A small wireless facility
that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be
considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless
facility within ninety (90) days after receipt of written notice from the
Village notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. The notice shall be
sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the Village
to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small
wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of such notice, the
Village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms
of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal utility poles or through
whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for
removal and cost recovery. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-21: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:
The utility or wireless provider shall remove all excess material and restore
all turf and terrain and other property within ten (10) days after any portion
of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to construction or
maintenance by the utility or wireless provider, all to the satisfaction of the
Village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of
roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the
Superintendent of Public Works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to
consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other
requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent
to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period
provided in this section may be extended by the Superintendent of Public Works
for good cause shown.
   (A)    Should a utility, provider (telecommunications or wireless) or their
contractors or any others working or operating in the right-of-way fail to
remove all excess material and restore turf and terrain to the satisfaction of
the Village, they will not receive their ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
deposit defined in Section
6-7-5-A-1 and be charged the full costs of restoration (if greater than the
deposit), including all related fees. The Village will charge the permit
applicant; however, the Village reserves the right to charge whoever the
Village finds responsible. Should the Village determine the applicant has
performed insufficient restoration efforts, the Village will notify the
applicant and provide    ten (10) business days to improve the restoration. If
afterwards the Village still determines the restoration efforts remain
insufficient, the Village will proceed with charging the applicant the fees
listed above. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-22: MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:
   (A)   General: Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility or wireless
provider in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility’s or
wireless provider’s expense.
      1.   If a utility or wireless provider does not maintain their
infrastructure in a manner satisfactory to the Village, the Village will notify
the utility or provider of the deficiency. If the utility or provider does not
correct the deficiency within 10 days (or sooner if the deficiency represents
and emergency), the Village will make arrangements to correct the deficiency
and the utility or provider will be charged in full (including the Village’s
time and costs) for the repairs.
   (B)   Emergency Maintenance Procedures: Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility or wireless provider shall take immediate steps to
provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on
the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If
a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is
such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair
operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the
shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of
access to the facility is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility or wireless provider shall, as soon as
possible, notify the Superintendent of Public Works or his or her duly
authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have
been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to
make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to
interfere with the free movement of traffic, the Village police shall be
notified immediately.
      3.   In an emergency, the utility or wireless provider shall use all
means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency Repairs: The utility or wireless provider must file in
writing with the Village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-
of-way within forty eight (48) hours after an emergency repair.
   (D)   Should the utility or wireless provider fail to perform up to the
standards outlined above during an emergency, the Village reserves the right to
fine the provider the deposit fee of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and
charge the utility or provider all costs to correct the deficiency (including
the Village’s time and any other direct costs related to correcting the
deficiency). (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)
6-7-23: VARIANCES:
   (A)   Request For Variance: A utility or wireless provider requesting a
variance from one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in
writing to the Superintendent of Public Works as a part of the permit
application. The request shall identify each provision of this chapter from
which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority To Grant Variances: The Superintendent of Public Works shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The Superintendent of Public
Works may authorize a variance only if the utility or wireless provider
requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility or
wireless provider (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line)
create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision
unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Superintendent of Public Works may require the
utility or wireless provider requesting the variance to meet reasonable
standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this
chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right To Appeal: Any utility or wireless provider aggrieved by any
order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance,
made by the Superintendent of Public Works under the provisions of this chapter
shall have the right to appeal to the Corporate Authorities, or such other
board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the
date of such order, requirement, decision or determination. The Corporate
Authorities shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board’s next
regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing

with the penalty provisions of section
1-4-1 of this Code. There may be times when the Village will incur delay or
other costs, including third party claims, because the utility or wireless
provider will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility or wireless provider shows that another allocation
of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility or
wireless provider shall bear the Village’s costs of damages and its costs of
installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that
is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may
review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the Village.
Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility or wireless provider that does not pay
the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 18-09, 8-6-2018; amd. Ord. 24-09, 8-19-2024)

   (B)   No person who is an habitual user of or under the influence of any
narcotic drug or who is under the influence of any other drug to a degree which
renders him incapable of safely driving a vehicle may drive or be in actual
physical control of any vehicle within this village. The fact that a person
charged with a violation of this subsection is or has been entitled to use such
drug under the law of this state does not constitute a defense against any
charge of violation of this subsection.
   (C)   Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of the acts
alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor,
evidence of the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act
alleged as shown by a chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine, saliva or
other bodily substance is admissible, as provided hereinafter in this
subsection and the result of any such analysis shall give rise to the following
presumptions:
      1.   If there was at the time of such analysis five one- hundredths
percent (0.05%) or less by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be
presumed that the person was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
      2.   If there was at the time of such analysis in excess of five one-
hundredths percent (0.05%) but less than ten one- hundredths percent (0.10%) by
weight of alcohol in the person's blood, such fact shall not give rise to any
presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of intoxicating
liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining whether such person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
      3.   If there was at the time of such analysis ten one- hundredths
percent (0.10%) or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be
presumed that the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
   Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of
alcohol per one hundred (100) cubic centimeters of blood. Evidence based upon a
chemical analysis of blood, urine, breath, saliva, or other bodily substance
shall not be admitted unless such substance was procured and such analysis made
with the consent of the person as provided in this section, whose bodily
substance was so analyzed.
   The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as
limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the
question whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating
liquor.
   (D)   Chemical analysis of the person's blood or breath to be considered
valid under this section must be performed according to uniform standards
adopted by the state department of public health, in cooperation with the
superintendent of state police, and by an individual possessing a valid permit
issued by that department for this purpose.
   (E)   When an unconscious person or person otherwise incapable of refusal is
given a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the
provisions of this section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine in
all its branches, a registered nurse or other qualified person may withdraw
blood, in a manner prescribed by the department of public health for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic content therein.
   (F)   The person tested may have a physician authorized to practice medicine
in all its branches, a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or
other qualified person of his own choosing, to administer a chemical test or
tests, at his own expense, in addition to any administered at the direction of
a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional
test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
   (G)   Upon the request of the person who submitted to a chemical test or
tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning
the test or tests must be made available to him or his attorney.
   (H)   Evidence of a refusal to submit to a chemical test is inadmissible in
any civil action or proceeding, or in any action brought against him for a
violation of this section. However, nothing in this subsection shall prevent
the admission of evidence of such refusal in a hearing on the suspension of a
person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle under 625 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/11-501.1 of the Illinois motor vehicle code.
   (I)   Every person who is convicted of a violation of this section shall be
guilty of a "misdemeanor" as defined in section
1-3-2 of this code. (Ord. 77-3, 6-6-1977)

7-3-25: UNLICENSED MOTORIZED DEVICES:
   (A)   Prohibited On Public Property: It shall be unlawful for a person to
operate an unlicensed motorized device on any public property. For purposes of
this section, an "unlicensed motorized device" is defined as any motorized
device or vehicle not bearing the proper registration plates from the Illinois
secretary of state or incapable of being registered by the Illinois secretary
of state under the provisions of the Illinois vehicle code, and shall include,
but is not limited to, motor scooters, go-carts, golf carts, go-peds,
minibikes, or motorbikes. This section shall not apply to automobiles,
"motorized wheelchairs" and "electric personal assistive mobility devices" (as
defined by the Illinois vehicle code), and any motorized device or vehicle
incapable of reaching a speed in excess of three (3) miles per hour. For
purposes of this section, "public property" is defined as any public street,
public sidewalk, public alley, public parks or any other property owned or
controlled by the village of Manteno, a public or private high school or
grammar school or any other property owned or controlled by a unit of local
government located within the village of Manteno.
   (B)   Procedure For Impoundment: Whenever a police officer has probable
cause to believe that a violation of subsection (A) of this section has
occurred, he is hereby authorized to seize and impound the unlicensed motorized
device. The failure to display the proper registration from the Illinois
secretary of state is prima facie proof that the instrumentality constitutes an
unlicensed motorized device.
   (C)   Preliminary Hearing: The owner of an unlicensed motorized device (or
any interested party) which has been impounded pursuant to subsection (B) of
this section shall have a right to a preliminary hearing to determine whether
the seizure and impoundment were erroneous. The preliminary hearing shall be
requested in writing to the chief of police, or his designee, within forty
eight (48) hours of the seizure. The hearing shall be conducted within forty
eight (48) hours of receipt of a written demand for the hearing by the chief of
police or his designee. Failure to request or attend a scheduled hearing within
forty eight (48) hours of the seizure shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
a preliminary hearing. If the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of
the evidence that the provisions of subsection (A) of this section have been
violated, he shall order that the unlicensed motorized device remain impounded
until a bond in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is posted with the
Manteno police department. If the hearing officer determines that the
provisions of subsection (A) of this section were not violated, the item seized
shall be returned to its owner.
   (D)   Hearings: A hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of
title 1, chapter 17, "Administrative Adjudication", of this code. The hearing
shall be held within forty five (45) days of the seizure. The hearing officer
shall be authorized to release the seized unlicensed motorized device upon the
payment of a fine and an additional storage charge in the amount of five
dollars ($5.00) per day. If a bond has been posted, it shall be applied towards
the fine and storage charges. If the hearing officer determines that the
provisions of subsection (A) of this section have not been violated, the seized
item shall be returned to its owner and any posted bond refunded. Any
unlicensed motorized device which remains unclaimed for a period in excess of
one year shall be presumed abandoned and may be destroyed. (Ord. 04-23, 10-18-

8-6-4: Administration And Enforcement; Appeals
8-6-1: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to create an aesthetically pleasing character of
the single-family residential districts in the village in order to protect and
enhance property values. The construction of single-family residences which are
substantially similar in appearance to other nearby single-family residences
are prohibited in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 04-14,
8-16-2004)
8-6-2: SIMILARITY IN APPEARANCE PROHIBITED IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION:
   (A)   No building permit shall be issued for any new detached single-family
dwelling units in the R-1 or R-2 zoning districts (the "subject lot") which is
similar in front facade appearance to any dwelling unit meeting the following
requirements:
      1.   The subject lot shall be dissimilar to dwelling units within two (2)
lots on either side on the same side of the street;
      2.   The subject lot shall be dissimilar to dwelling units directly
across the street and within one lot thereof;
      3.   With respect to lots with frontage on the bulb of a cul-de-sac, the
subject lot shall be dissimilar to dwelling units within one lot on either side
of the subject lot or directly across the cul-de-sac from the subject lot.
      4.   With respect to front yards, in the event the lot adjacent on either
side of the subject lot, the lot directly across the street or the lot adjacent
on either side of that lot directly across the street from the subject lot has
a different yard type (i.e., side, rear) adjacent to the shared street, then
the restrictions shall not apply to those lots.
      5.   When calculating lots for purposes of dissimilarity, an intervening
street shall be counted as one lot;
      6.   When calculating lots for purposes of dissimilarity, lots shall not
be restricted if separated from the subject lot by a collector road.
   (B)   On corner lots, no building permit shall be issued for any new
detached single-family dwelling unit in the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts which
are similar in side facades. On lots backing up to a public right of way or
secondary road, no building permit shall be issued for any new detached single-
family dwelling unit in the R-1 or R-2 zoning district which are similar in
rear facades; except when there is an approved landscape berm or plan, approved
by the board of trustees.
   (C)   A dwelling on a corner lot may be considered dissimilar to another if
the front of the two (2) dwelling units face different streets.
   (D)   Dwelling units must comply with the dissimilarity provisions which are
applicable to the front facade, side facades, and rear facade. (Ord. 04-14, 8-
16-2004)
8-6-3: STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING SIMILARITY IN APPEARANCE:
   (A)   Distinguishing Characteristics, Front Facade: For the purpose of this
chapter, the term "similar in appearance" shall mean a dwelling unit which is
identical, or substantially similar, to another in any three (3) of the
following characteristics with respect to the front facade:
      1.   Roof type (gable, hip, mansard, gambrel, flat or combination).
Mixtures of roof types and design are sufficient to render dwelling units
dissimilar.
      2.   Roof height or pitch shall be significantly different.
      3.   Approximate dimensions (height and length) of the front wall closest
to the front lot line.
      4.   Shape of the front elevation silhouette.
      5.   Relative locations, types and sizes of windows in the front
elevation. The addition or subtractions of muntin bars, small gable or hip
projections above windows, and window dormers are not sufficient to make
adjacent structures dissimilar.
      6.   Relative location, design and dimensions of garage door, if included
on the front elevation.
      7.   Type and color of front facade materials (e.g., brick veneer, lapped
horizontal siding, half timber, board and batten, shakes, etc.). Changes in
materials must occur throughout the front facade or elevation for a minimum of
one story in height. Color change shall be made by significant changes in
shades of color.
   (B)   Distinguishing Characteristics, Side And Rear Facades On Corner Lots,
And Rear Facades Fronting A Public Right Of Way: For the purpose of this
subsection, the term "similar in appearance" shall mean a dwelling which is
identical, or substantially similar, to another type and color of side and rear
facade (e.g., brick veneer, lapped horizontal siding, half timber, board and
batten, shakes, etc.). Changes in materials must occur throughout the entire
facade or elevation for a minimum of one story in height. Color change shall be
made by significant changes in shades of color.
   (C)   Housing Styles: Housing style is in and of itself a significant enough
characteristic to constitute dissimilarity with respect to the subject lot and
the similarity standards delineated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section
do not apply. Housing styles shall consist of the following: ranch, bilevel,
trilevel, one and one-half story, and two-story.
   (D)   Model Homes: Elevation designs must be provided for each type of
dwelling. For model designs, a minimum of three (3) alternate elevations for
each design shall be provided to the village and to prospective customers.
(Ord. 04-14, 8-16-2004)
8-6-4: ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT; APPEALS:
   (A)   Rules: The village administrator, or his/her designee, is authorized
to make rules regarding the interpretation of the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Determination: The code enforcement officer shall make the initial
determination as to similarity in appearance and shall not issue a building
permit for any dwelling unit which violates the provisions of this chapter. If
a permit is denied, written reasons shall be provided detailing why the
proposed dwelling unit is similar in appearance to another dwelling unit.
   (C)   Appeal: A decision by the code enforcement officer denying a permit
may be appealed in writing to the building and planning committee of the
village board, or such other committee as authorized thereby.
   (D)   Variations: The board of trustees reserves the right to waive the
provisions of this chapter by motion approved at a board meeting.
   (E)   Applicability: The provisions of this chapter apply only to the
issuance of building permits for a newly constructed dwelling unit and not to
remodeling or reconstruction. (Ord. 04-14, 8-16-2004)

committees of the village board, along with other municipal officials who may
be authorized from time to time to do so, with prior written notice to the
administrator, may retain outside consultants with established expertise in
disciplines necessary to evaluate applications for annexation, zoning,
subdivision and construction to assist the officials of the village, its
committees and the corporate authorities in processing applications for
municipal action or permission. For purposes of this chapter, the terms
"necessary or desirable" do not mean only such measures as are absolutely and
indispensably necessary, but include all appropriate means which are conducive
or adaptable to the end to be accomplished and which, in the judgment of the
authorized official, will most advantageously permit the municipality to act
upon the application or request. (Ord. 04-17, 8-2-2004)

The village shall disclose to the applicant or requesting party that it is
utilizing such consulting services, and that party must pay within thirty (30)
days after the submission of an invoice from the consultant for the services
provided. The services provided shall be reasonable and customary, and the
invoices shall be itemized and shall be within a range generally chargeable by
the consultants in performing similar services. It shall not be a defense to
the payment of such invoices that the applicant could obtain such consultant
services at a lower cost, so long as the fees charged by the village's
consultants are within the range typically charged for similar services by
outside consultants to municipalities within the Chicago metropolitan area. The
intention of the corporate authorities is to utilize experienced and competent
consultants to fairly assess the material they are asked to review with
adequate time to provide excellent reports to village officials, who will then
be able to reach fair decisions without prejudice or uncertainty. (Ord. 04-17,
8-2-2004)
8-7-3: FEES FOR STAFF REVIEW:
In addition to establishing a system for the invoicing of consultants' fees,
the village may charge the reasonable cost for its own employees to process,
analyze and report upon the application or request. The village administrator
may, from time to time, establish, subject to approval of the village board,
standardized fees for application, analysis or review processes. Where no
standard fee has been established, the provisions of section
8-7-1 of this chapter shall apply. Notice of standard fees shall be provided to
any applicant as part of the application information. (Ord. 04-17, 8-2-2004)
8-7-4: FINAL ACTION; PAYMENT OF FEES:
Final action on any application may be delayed until any amount due and payable
has been paid. The village may require the posting of an irrevocable letter of
credit to guarantee that payments will be promptly made. The municipality may
require a certified check or the posting of an irrevocable letter of credit to
guarantee fees and consultant costs already incurred, but not paid, at the time
the application or permit is acted upon. (Ord. 04-17, 8-2-2004)

coverage, lot area, lot width and yard requirements can be developed only after
a variance is granted by the planning commission. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd.

when less than five (5) acres in size as required by and in conformance with
the village subdivision regulations and the state plat act. Legally divided
areas of land or lots in excess of five (5) acres shall be eligible for special
uses only in any zoning district, and as determined and accepted by the village
board. In addition, the village will recognize as legal only those lots that
have met all applicable regulations and fees of the subdivision ordinance.
   (B)   Permit Issuance: Under no circumstances shall a permit of any type be
issued for any parcel of land which has not been recognized as a legal lot by
the village.
   (C)   Number Of Buildings On A Lot: Not more than one principal building may
be located on a single lot of record or a single lot unless otherwise
authorized within each zoning district.
   (D)   Division Of Lots: No lot shall be divided into two (2) or more lots
for the purpose of transfer of ownership, unless the division shall conform
with all the applicable regulations of the village subdivision regulations and
this title. Any violation of this section will result in village refusal to
accept such divisions as legal lots until all requirements have been met and
applicable fees paid.
   (E)   Through Lots: On vacant through lots, the front lot lines shall be
along the street right of way designated by the code enforcement officer,
except that when a front lot line has been established on one or more lots in
the same block and all have front lot lines established along the same street
right of way, the street right of way line designated as the front lot line for
such lot or lots shall be the front line on all vacant through lots for such
block. Only such obstructions as herein permitted in front yards shall be
located in that part of a rear yard adjoining a street that is equivalent in
depth to a required front yard.
   (F)   Corner Lots: On a corner lot, the front lot line shall be the lot line
as determined by the code enforcement officer. The required front yard setback
on corner lots shall apply to each side of the lot facing a street.
   (G)   Two Uses On A Lot: Where two (2) or more permitted or special uses,
each requiring a minimum area and frontage, are provided in the same building
or on the same lot, the required area and frontages shall be the sum of the
areas and frontage required for each use individually.
   (H)   Street Frontage And Access: Every lot must have frontage on a public
street and must be provided with facilities for ingress and/or egress to and
from such public street conforming to such standards as to design and location
as meet the requirements set forth by the village and are approved by the road
authority onto whose road or street such ingress and/or egress is to be made.
Residential lots which abut upon major streets shall also abut upon a local

width of seventy feet (70') measured at the building setback line.
   (J)   Lot Dimensions: Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of
the appropriate zoning classification, but in no case shall a lot have an
average depth of less than one hundred twenty feet (120'). In the case of
double frontage or reverse frontage lots, the minimum average depth shall be
one hundred fifty feet (150').
   (K)   Existing Lots: Any lot in a single ownership, which was of record at
the time of the adoption hereof, that does not meet the requirements of this
title as to area and lot width which is located in a residential district, may
be utilized for single- family residence purposes, provided that it qualifies
under all other regulations. This shall not be interpreted to reduce the
buildable width of a corner lot, or a corner lot and adjoining lot in single
ownership, subdivided and recorded by law at the time of the passage hereof, to
less than one hundred feet (100'). (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)

required yards, courts, or other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to
any building, shall by virtue of change of ownership, or for any other reason,
be used to satisfy yard, court, or other open space or minimum lot area
requirements for any other building.

building existing on the effective date of the zoning ordinance shall
subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced if already less than, the
minimum yard requirement of the title for equivalent new construction. However,

9-4-1: INTENT:
This chapter is intended to provide the means and the guidelines through which
tracts of land may be developed through an overall approach, rather than the
traditional lot by lot treatment afforded by other districts in this chapter.
It is intended to provide a maximum of design freedom by permitting the
developer an opportunity to utilize the physical characteristics of the site
more fully through the reduction of lot sizes, yard, height and bulk
restrictions and the planned mixing of uses. Through the requirements of a
development plan, it is the intent that property under this chapter will be
developed through a unified design providing contiguity between the various
elements and ultimately leading to a better environment. Increased residential
densities may be permitted under this chapter if such increases can be
substantiated on the basis that the superior design makes greater densities
possible with no reduction of amenities. This chapter is not intended as a
panacea and should not be utilized as a device for making increased densities
more palatable, or as a means of circumventing the village’s development
regulations. This chapter should only be employed in instances where there is
truly some benefit for the community to be derived from its use. (Ord. 99-06,
6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022; Ord. passed 9-19-2022)
9-4-2: PURPOSE:
In addition to the general purpose of this chapter, the purpose of this section
is to establish standards and procedures for planned unit developments, in
order that the following objectives may be obtained:
   (A)   Variety and flexibility in land development that is necessary to meet
with the best interests of the entire village.
   (B)   The allocation, maintenance, and permanent preservation of common open
space, recreation areas and facilities; to offer recreational opportunities
close to home, to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation
of natural resources.
   (C)   A maximum choice in the types of environments available to the public
by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the other sections of this chapter, as well as the subdivision
regulations.
   (D)   A pattern of development to preserve natural vegetation, topographic
and geologic features, air and water quality, and other natural resources and
amenities.
   (E)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that result in better development and design, and the construction of aesthetic
amenities.
   (F)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economic networks of
utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings and other facilities.
   (G)   Land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort and
welfare.
   (H)   Innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development so
that growing demands of the population may be met by greater variety in type,
design, and layout of space ancillary to said buildings. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-
1999; amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022; Ord. passed 9-19-2022)
9-4-3: APPLICATION AND REVIEW FEE:
Prior to village review of a sketch development plan, preliminary development
plan or a final development plan, the developer shall have remitted all
required fees and review expenses to the village clerk. (Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022;
Ord. passed 9-19-2022)
9-4-4: APPLICATION PROCEDURE:
A planned unit development shall be granted as a special use permit, in
accordance with standards and procedures of the Manteno zoning ordinance and
may depart from the normal procedures and requirements of this chapter and the
subdivision regulations. Applications shall be accompanied by the required
plats, documents, and other data as required. Before applying for a planned
unit development, an applicant may confer with the village administrator and/or
the director of building and zoning to obtain information and guidance before
entering into binding commitments or incurring substantial materials; provided
however, that no such preapplication conference shall result in any binding
commitments on behalf of the applicant or the village. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999;
amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022; Ord. passed 9-19-2022)
9-4-5: PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE:
   (A)   Prior to the developer’s filing of an application for sketch
development plan review, it is recommended that the owner or subdivider consult
with the village administrator and/or the director of building and zoning to
secure information relative to the land use and zoning requirements,
development regulations and standards, and other applicable regulations and
standards. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to afford the
subdivider the opportunity to obtain the advice and assistance of village
officials, staff and other advisors and to discuss the proposed development
informally prior to the preparation of the sketch plan to process approvals in
a cost effective and time efficient manner.
   (B)   Before the meeting, it is suggested that the subdivider prepare a site
plan of the proposed planned unit development on a topographic survey of the
area showing the proposed layout of streets, arrangement of lots, and other
features in relation to the existing conditions. Upon receipt of any request
for a preapplication conference, the village administrator shall schedule a
conference meeting with the developer and village representatives as deemed
necessary by the village administrator.(Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022; Ord. passed 9-19-
2022)
9-4-6: SKETCH DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION:
   (A)   Application: In order to discuss the general purpose of the planned
unit development in the context of establishing planning policies and practices

prepared and presented before expending the time and money in preparation and
review of a engineered preliminary plan, any person desiring to develop land
subject to this title, before filing a final plan, shall file an application
and sketch development plan of the planned development with the village clerk.
After review of the application and sketch plan by village staff and within
thirty (30) days of submittal, the sketch plan shall be placed on the agenda of
a regular planning commission meeting.

and/or expense billed for staff, infrastructure mapping, modeling, GIS and
database updates, court reporters for appearance and transcript fees, and such
other consultants or professionals as are hired by the village during the
technical, preliminary and final plan review process and through the village’s
final acceptance of all public improvements. Said escrow shall also be used to
pay the cost of all special planning commission or village board meetings
required in the planned unit development process.
      2.   The amount to be deposited by the applicant shall be not less than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). Said escrow funds shall be deposited and

the village of Manteno. The village shall make disbursements from said escrow
funds upon the receipt of billing statements, provided said statements have
been reviewed and approved by the village board. Notice to the applicant shall
not be a prerequisite to the village making said disbursements. If at any time
after commencement of the review process the amount deposited has been reduced
to a balance of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) or less, the applicant shall
be required to deposit an additional amount with the village so that the escrow
balance is not less than the amount the applicant was originally required to
deposit. Said additional amount shall be deposited with the village treasurer

development is submitted for approval, it shall be an obligation of the
developer of such portion to cause the developer of the planned development to
prepare and submit to the village with such preliminary plan, an updated land
use plan for those areas in the planned development for which preliminary plans
shall not then have been submitted for approval.
      2.   Annual Submissions: When no updated land use plan of the planned
unit development shall have been prepared for one year, the developer of the
planned development shall, unless the village waives such obligation, prepare
and submit to the village a land use plan for those areas in the planned
development for which preliminary plans shall not then have been submitted for
approval. (Ord. passed 9-19-2022
9-4-8: FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
   (A)   Purpose: The purpose of the final development plan is to designate

9-4-9: STANDARDS:
In granting or withholding approval of the sketch development plan, preliminary
development plan or final development plan, the planning commission and the
village board shall be guided by the requirements of this chapter and the
following standards:
   (A)   Public Good: All plans shall be so designed that the public health,
welfare, and safety will be protected.
   (B)   Property Value: The proposed development shall be such that it does
not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the immediate
area.
   (C)   Protection Of Conditions: All plans shall provide for protection of
both aesthetics and function of the natural environment, which shall include,
but not be limited to, conditions pertaining to floodplains, soil, and geologic
characteristics, air quality, and preservation of vegetation.
   (D)   Common Open Space: All plans shall provide for and ensure the
preservation of adequate recreational facilities and common open space.
   (E)   Balanced Neighborhood: Residential use areas shall have a variety of
housing types and densities necessary to achieve a balanced neighborhood.
   (F)   Public Activities: The planned development shall include land area
necessary to accommodate cultural, educational, recreational, and other public
and quasi-public activities necessary to serve the needs of the residents
thereof.
   (G)   Creative Land Uses: The proposed development shall provide for the
orderly and creative arrangement of all land uses with respect to each other
and to the entire village.
   (H)   Ways For Pedestrians and Cyclists: Walkways shall form a logical, safe
and convenient system for pedestrian access to all dwelling units and to all
project facilities and off-site destinations likely to attract substantial
pedestrian traffic. Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children as
play areas or routes to schools or other principal destinations shall be so
located and safeguarded as to minimize contacts with normal automobile traffic.
Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on such walkways, located and
designed to promote safety, appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. If
substantial bicycle traffic is anticipated, bicycle paths shall be incorporated
in the walkway system. Pedestrian ways appropriately located, designed, and
constructed may be combined with other easements and uses by emergency or
service vehicles, but shall not be used by other automotive traffic.
      1.    Access: Access for pedestrians and cyclists shall be arranged to
provide safe, convenient routes, and need not be limited to the vehicular
access points. When pedestrian access points do not occur at street
intersections, they shall be marked and controlled, and when such ways are
exposed to substantial vehicular traffic at the edges of a district, fences or
other barriers shall be erected and maintained to prevent crossings except at
designated points. Bicycle paths, if provided, shall be so related to the
pedestrian way system that street crossings are combined.
      2.    Screening at Edges of The Planned Unit Development: Fences, walls
or vegetation screening shall be provided along the edges of the planned
development where needed to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting,
noise, or other off-site influences or to protect occupants of adjoining
residential districts from similar adverse influences within the planned
development. In both cases, screening shall be designed to control the existing
or potential first floor residential windows in the planned development or
other residential district. Screening requirements may be waived where terrain
makes protection overview impractical. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 22-01,
5-2-2022; Ord. passed 9-19-2022)
9-4-10: LEGAL STATUS OF PLANS AND COVENANTS; CHANGES:

compliance with the recorded final development plan and supporting data. All
final plans and covenants and/or deed restrictions filed and recorded hereunder
shall be contractual undertakings by, and shall be binding upon, the
applicants; therefore, the owners of the land covered by such planned
development and their successors and assigns shall limit and control the
construction location and use and operation of all land in such planned
development, and all improvements and structures to be located thereon.
      1.   Schedule: The village board shall consider the planned unit
development subject to revocation if construction falls more than two (2) years
behind the filed and approved schedule. The developer shall be notified at
least ninety (90) days prior to any revocation hearing.
      2.   Changes in Final Approved Plan During Development: Upon issuance of
a special use permit and the necessary building permits, no changes may be made
during or after the development of the final development plan as approved and
recorded unless such changes are made pursuant to a new and separate
application for a planned unit development.
      3.   Occupancy: No planned unit development, or any portion thereof, may
be occupied until such time as a certificate of occupancy has been issued by
the building department certifying that the development of a stage of the
planned development, if applicable, has been completed in compliance with the
final development plan as approved and recorded.
   (B)   Major Changes: Any of the following changes shall be deemed to be a
“major change”:
      1.   A change which alters the concept, character or intent of the
preliminary development plan.
      2.   A change which increases residential density.
      3.   A change which significantly increases the height of any building or
structure; or alters the uses and design standards set forth as a minimum in
this chapter.
      4.   A change which significantly increases nonresidential floor area by
more than ten percent (10%).
      5.   A change which reduces the amount of common open space of
recreational land.
      6.   A change in the land use plan.
      7.   A change in the transportation plan.
   (C)   Minor Changes: The planning commission may recommend approval of minor
changes in the planned unit development which do not change the concept or
intent of the development. “Minor changes” are defined as any change not
defined as a major change. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022;

9-4-12: BULK REGULATION; EXCEPTIONS:
In the case of any planned unit development, the planning commission may
recommend, and the village board may authorize, exceptions to the bulk
regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of such planned development,
provided that the planning commission shall find:
   (A)   That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of such
development as well as the neighboring property, that would be obtained under
the bulk regulations of the district in which said development is located.
   (B)   That along the periphery of such planned unit developments, yard shall
be provided as required by the regulations of the district in which said
development is located.
   (C)   That in a residential planned unit development the maximum number of

   (A)   Definitions:
 
                             Large active and passive recreational areas
                             generally located on or near thoroughfares and
                             within two (2) miles of each residence intended to
DISTRICT PARKS:              be served. District parks generally adjoin junior
                             and senior high schools and often include such
                             facilities as swimming pools, tennis complexes,
                             recreational building and adequate off-street
                             parking.
                             Active and passive recreational areas which
                             usually serve children and adults in an urban area
                             within a radius of approximately one-half (1/2)
                             mile. Neighborhood parks generally adjoin public
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS:          elementary schools and may include such features
                             as ball diamonds and play area toward the interior
                             of the site so the perimeter can be landscaped to
                             buffer sound and provide a measure of safety to
                             the public.
                             Parkways, medians, landscaped green space, or

                             generally feature play apparatuses, benches, sand
PLAY LOTS:                   areas and landscaping. Play lots should be located
                             near the center of the housing areas generating
                             children of such ages so that children need not
                             cross arterial streets to reach play lots.
                             Land specifically designed and intended for the
                             active or passive recreational use of the
                             residents of the planned unit development and

                             of being utilized for multipurpose recreational
                             activities; pedestrian corridors; bicycle trails;
                             greenbelts; and open space networks.
 
   (B)   Designation:
      1.   The planning commission shall determine, in its reasonable
discretion, whether land is designated and intended for the recreational use of
residents of the planned development and in so doing shall consider the
following factors:
         (a)   The relationship of the location of the land being considered to
the residential use area which it is intended to serve.
         (b)   The size and usability of the land being considered.
         (c)   Other existing or proposed recreational facilities capable of
fulfilling recreational needs of the residents.
   (C)   Maintenance Of Common Open Space And Recreation Areas: In the event
that the organization established to own and maintain common open space and
recreation areas and related facilities or any successory organization, shall,
at any time after establishment of the planned unit development, fail to
maintain the common open space and recreation areas and related facilities in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, the village may
serve written notice upon such organization or upon the residents of the
planned development setting forth the manner in which the organization has
failed to maintain the space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall
include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured within thirty
(30) days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a hearing thereon
which shall be held within fourteen (14) days of the notice. At such hearing
the village may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies
and may give an extension of time within which they shall be cured. If the
deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof
shall not be cured within said thirty (30) days or any extension thereof, the
village, to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the planned
development and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon said property and maintain the same for a period of
one year.
Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public any rights to use the
common open space or recreation areas when the same is voluntarily dedicated to
the public by the owners. Before the expiration of said year, the village
shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for the maintenance of the common open space, call a public hearing
upon notice to such organization, or to the residents of the planned unit
development show cause why such maintenance by the village shall not, at the
election of the village, continue for a succeeding year. If the village board
shall determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain said
common open space and recreation areas at the end of said year, then such
matter shall be discontinued. If the village board shall determine that such
organization is not ready and able to maintain said common open space and
recreation areas in a reasonable condition, the village may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding year and
subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. The
decision of the village board in any such case shall constitute a final
administrative decision subject to review in accordance with appropriate
provisions of this chapter.
The cost of such maintenance by the village shall be assessed ratably against
the properties within the planned unit development that have a right of
enjoyment of the common open space and recreation space and shall become a tax
lien on said properties. The village at the time of entering upon said property
for the purpose of maintenance, shall file an appropriate notice of such lien
upon the properties affected by such lien within the planned development. (Ord.

Building, zoning and occupancy permits shall be required for each structure in
a planned unit development. No building permit relating to any part of a
planned development shall be issued prior to the approval of a final plan or
such part of the planned development; provided, however, that subject to the
approval of the village, excavation operations (construction of sewer, water
and other utility improvements) may proceed at any time following approval of
the preliminary development plan. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-

9-4-17: EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A SPECIAL USE:
No application for a special use, which has been denied wholly or in part by
the village board shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date
of said order of denial except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions found to be valid by the planning commission and the
village board. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 22-01, 5-2-2022; Ord. passed

9-9C-5: Investigation
9-9C-1: PURPOSE:
   (A)   To provide that business, utilities, light industry, research and
related activities shall be established and maintained with proper appearance
from streets and adjoining properties.
   (B)   To provide that each permitted or special use shall be a good neighbor
to adjoining properties by the control of emission of noise, odor, glare,
light, vibration, smoke, particulate matter, gases, wastes and other hazards.
   (C)   To state the conditions of construction and operation with which uses
will be expected to comply. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
9-9C-2: COMPLIANCE:
   (A)   Performance Standards Procedure:
      1.   Any application for a building permit for a use which shall be
subject to performance standards shall be accompanied by a sworn statement
filed by the owner of subject property or the operator of the proposed use that
said use will be operated in accordance with the performance standards set
forth herein.
In many cases, the relation of a prospective use to all these performance
standards cannot be judged properly at the time of building permit issuance. In
such cases, the recipient of the building permit should note that these
standards, like all other provisions of this title, are continuing obligations
and that all uses shall be expected to operate in compliance with these
standards. The building plans shall bear the signature of a qualified
professional stating that all performance standards will be complied with based
upon the submitted building plans. The village retains the option to conduct
its own investigation to determine compliance with the performance standards.
      2.   Continued compliance with performance standards is required and
enforcement of continued compliance with these performance standards shall be
enforced by the code enforcement officer.
      3.   The code enforcement officer shall investigate any purported
violation of performance standards and, if there is reasonable grounds for the
same, shall notify the village board of the occurrence or existence of a
probable violation thereof. If after investigation, the code enforcement
officer finds that a violation occurred or exists, such violation shall be
terminated as provided in subsection (A)4 of this section.
      4.   All violations, as ascertained through investigation, shall be
terminated within thirty (30) days of the decision of the code enforcement
officer or shall be deemed a separate violation for each day following and
subject to fines as set forth herein, except that certain uses established
before the effective date of these regulations and nonconforming as to
performance standards shall be given a reasonable time in which to conform
therewith as determined by the code enforcement officer. Any violation which
presents an emergency to person or property shall be dealt with immediately in
a manner determined by emergency personnel.
   (B)   Regulation Of Nuisance Elements:
      1.   No land or building in any I-1 or I-2 district which shall be used,
occupied or operated in such a manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious,
noxious or otherwise objectionable, fire, explosive or other hazard; noise or
vibration, smoke, dust, dirt or other form of air pollution; electrical or
other disturbance; glare; or other substance, condition or element in such
amount as to adversely affect the surrounding area or premises at the specified
point or points of the determination.
      2.   The determination of the existence of any dangerous and
objectionable elements shall be made at:
         (a)   The point or points where such elements shall be most apparent
for fire and explosion hazards, for radioactivity and electrical disturbances,
for smoke and other forms of air pollution.
         (b)   At or beyond the property lines of the use creating such
elements for noise, for vibration, for glare, and for odors, wherever the

adversely affecting the operation of any equipment. All applicable federal
regulations shall be complied with.
   (C)   Noise: Noise shall be measured on any property line of the tract on
which the operation is located. Noise shall be muffled so as not to become
objectionable due to intermittence, beat frequency, shrillness, or intensity.
At the property line, the sound pressure level of noise radiated continuously
from a facility shall not exceed the value given in tables 1 and 2 of this
subsection (C) of any octave band frequency. The sound pressure level shall be
measured with a sound level meter and an octave band analyzer that conform to
specifications published by the American Standards Association. Octave band
analyzers shall be calibrated in the preferred frequencies (American Standards
Association S1.6-1967). Preferred frequencies for acoustical measurements shall
be used.

instruments at the property line of the lot from which they are emitted.
Detailed plans for the prevention of odors crossing property lines may be
required before the issuance of a building permit.
   (E)   Glare: Glare, whether direct or reflected, such as from floodlights or
high temperature processes, and as differentiated from general illumination,
shall not be visible at any property line. Any operation or activity producing
glare shall be performed within a completely enclosed building and be conducted
so that direct and indirect illumination from the source of light on the lot
shall not cause illumination in excess of one-half (1/2) foot-candle when
measured at the lot line. Exposed sources of light shall be shielded and
intense sources of light shall be controlled so as not to cause a nuisance
across lot lines.
   (F)   Exterior Lighting: Any lights used for exterior illumination shall
direct light away from adjoining properties.
   (G)   Heat: Any operation producing intense heat shall be performed within a
completely enclosed building in such a manner as not to create a public
nuisance or hazard along lot lines.
   (H)   Vibration: No vibration shall be permitted which is detectable without
instruments at any property line of the lot.

said chart may be emitted except that smoke not darker or more opaque than no.
1 on said chart may be emitted for periods not longer than four (4) minutes in
any thirty (30) minutes. These provisions, applicable to visible gray smoke,
shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color but with an equivalent
apparent opacity.
   (J)   Particulate Matter: Solid or liquid particles shall not be emitted at
any point in concentrations exceeding 0.1 grains per cubic foot of the
conveying gas or air. For measurement of the amount of particles in gases
resulting from combustion, standard corrections shall be applied to a stack
temperature of five hundred degrees Fahrenheit (500°F) and fifty percent (50%)
excess air.
   (K)   Gases: Fumes or gases shall not be emitted at any point in
concentrations or amounts that are noxious, toxic, or corrosive. Detailed plans
for the elimination of fumes or gases may be required before the issuance of a
building permit.
   (L)   Other Forms Of Pollution: No emission of fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors,
gases or any other forms of air, earth or water pollution shall be permitted
which can cause any damage to health, to animal, vegetation, or other forms of
property, or which can cause any excessive soiling. No discharge beyond lot
lines of any toxic or noxious matter in such quantity as to be detrimental to
or endanger the public health, safety, comfort, or welfare, or cause injury or
damage to property or business, shall be permitted.
   (M)   Hazard: Any operation allowed in articles A and B of this chapter
shall be carried on with reasonable precautions against fire and explosion
hazards.
   (N)   Waste: All sewage and industrial wastes shall be treated and disposed
of in such manner as to comply with the water quality standards applicable to
the classification assigned to the receiving waters by the village, the state
of Illinois, and the USEPA. Approval of the Illinois environmental protection
agency of all plans for waste disposal facilities shall be required before
issuance of any building permit. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
9-9C-5: INVESTIGATION:
   (A)   Should the code enforcement officer determine that the proposed or
current use violates or may violate the performance standards as set forth
herein, an investigation shall be initiated. The property owner shall provide
information as requested, including, but not limited to, the following:
      1.   Plans of the existing or proposed construction and development.
      2.   A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes and
products.
      3.   Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to
be used in restricting the possible emission of any of the dangerous and
objectionable elements as set forth in this section.
      4.   Measurements of the amount or rate of emission of said dangerous and
objectionable elements. Failure to submit data requested by the code
enforcement officer shall constitute an intentional violation. (Ord. 99-06, 6-
21-1999)
   (B)   The code enforcement officer may require any person, firm or
corporation to retain an expert consultant or consultants to study and report
as to compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards, and to advise
how a proposed or current use could be brought into compliance. Such
consultants shall be fully qualified to give the required information and shall
be persons or firms mutually agreeable to the code enforcement officer and to
the owner or operator of the use in question. In the event of inability to
select a mutually agreeable consultant, the planning commission shall select
the consultant. The cost of the consultant's services shall be borne by the
owner or operator of said use. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-
2005)
   (C)   If violation continues to exist after the conclusion of the time
granted for compliance with the performance standards, any permits previously
issued shall be void and the operator shall be required to cease operation
until the violation is remedied. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)

9-10C-1: INTRODUCTION:
   (A)   Purpose: The village of Manteno adopts this article as the ROUTE 50
CORRIDOR CODE with a clear vision and preferred urban design arrangement for
the heritage district and beyond. This article implements Manteno's vision with
a precise form based approach.
   This article was created to enhance the architectural aesthetic quality and
strengthen economic base of the Route 50 corridor district by implementing the
following principles:
      1.   Ensure that new development respects the historic scale and
character of the Route 50 corridor district.
      2.   Build a strong economic future for Manteno.
      3.   Preserve Manteno's unique historic heritage.
      4.   Create walkable downtown and Route 50 corridor areas where
pedestrians come first.
      5.   Create a connected roadway framework with small walkable blocks.
      6.   Promote a green downtown showcasing leadership in the preservation
of natural resources and sustainable practices.
   (B)   Intent: This article is intended to allow for the continued function
of contemporary land uses, while creating standards and design criteria for
infill and redevelopment projects. These regulations have been developed to
accomplish the goals of this article by:
      1.   Regulating building form to create a street wall of appropriately
scaled buildings that address the street and create a pedestrian oriented
setting.
      2.   Prohibiting the placement of off street parking in front yards in
order to maintain the continuity of buildings along the street, minimize the
views of parked cars, and provide adequate sidewalks and amenities for
pedestrians and bicyclists.
      3.   Restricting drive-through facilities and other automobile related
uses to encourage an environment where pedestrian comfort and safety comes
first.
      4.   Regulating streets and rights of way to encourage landscaped
streetscapes and complete streets that accommodate multiple modes of travel.
      5.   Concentrating commercial development in a walkable Route 50 corridor
district and transition areas outside the district to residential development
to create a supportive neighborhood market.
      6.   Creating architectural standards to ensure that new buildings comply
with the community's shared vision.
      7.   Creating a review process that rewards compliance with this article
with a shortened review process.
   (C)   Applicability: This article shall apply to the area of land along
Illinois Route 50 (Locust Street) and Oak Street generally from the south
branch of Rock Creek to the northern Manteno boundary as depicted on figure
1.C.1 of this section and as designated on the official zoning map of the
village of Manteno. This area is to be depicted as the Route 50 corridor
district.
   The standards set forth in this article shall apply and rezone property
within the Route 50 corridor district.
   Should this article be found by village staff to be silent on any matter
that is otherwise provided for in any other section of the zoning ordinance, or
building code, the applicable provisions of those sections shall apply.
   In the event of conflict between this article and the village's zoning
ordinance or building code, the provisions of this article shall govern.
   (D)   Severability: Should any section or provision of this article be
declared invalid, the invalidity thereof shall not affect any of the other
provisions of this article or zoning ordinance, as a whole.
   (E)   Process Overview: The following provides a concise overview of the
general review process for the development of new property within the Route 50
corridor district. The intent of this article is to reward those who strive to
meet its standards and regulations. Therefore, the length of review time and
number of meetings required to obtain project approval shall be based upon the
degree of conformity to this article. Those changes involving existing
structures will typically not require public meetings unless a determination is
made by village staff that the nature of the modifications warrant review by
village commissions and/or the village board. A complete description of the
process and submission requirements is located in section
9-10C-5 of this article.

to a building situated either in whole or in part outside the footprint of the
building.
BELOW GRADE PARKING: Parking facilities located either in whole or in part
below grade.
BLOCK END: A lot having at least two (2) sides abutting a street.
BUILDING HEIGHT: The number of stories between the floor of the first story
(exclusive of basements or cellars) and the roof, and shall include both
habitable and mechanical space.

GRANDFATHERED SITES: Those lots with structures or uses that lawfully existed
prior to the adoption of this article. Grandfathered sites are generally
classified as such until they incur voluntary, private owner initiated site
improvements that exceed fifty percent (50%) of the property's market value
based on most recent tax bill, at which time they shall be reclassified as
redevelopment sites and subject to the pertinent provisions within this
district. Absent such voluntary, private owner initiated site improvements,
grandfathered sites may retain their nonconforming status in perpetuity, and
can change owner and/or use, be maintained and repaired as part of normal
upkeep, undergo site improvements that do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
property's market value based on most recent tax bill and be rebuilt following
a natural or manmade event. Nonconforming uses and building types lawfully
established at the time of the natural or manmade event may be reestablished,
provided that no new nonconformities are created and that the existing degree
of nonconformity is not increased, and with the condition that the property be
reconstructed to meet the private lot, corridor and alley standards of this
district. In order to reestablish previous nonconforming uses and building
types following a natural or manmade event, a building permit relative to such
reestablishment must be obtained within one year of the date of the damage or
destruction by a natural or manmade event, and construction must be completed
within one year of issuance of the building permit. In the event that the
permit is not obtained within one year from the date of damage or destruction
by a natural or manmade event, or construction is not completed within one year
of the issuance of the building permit, the grandfathered site status shall be
lost, and the building or use must thereafter conform to those allowed in this
district.
LINEAR FRONTAGE (BLOCK): The distance as measured along the front lot line of
one or more properties abutting one side of a thoroughfare and lying between
the two (2) nearest intersecting streets as determined by staff.
LOT ASSEMBLAGE: The assemblage of two (2) or more contiguous parcels to form a
single lot.
MARKET VALUE: Shall be determined, within the Route 50 corridor area, by

the level of assessment used by the assessor for the type of property (i.e.,
vacant, single-family, commercial, etc.). For example, a property with an
assessed valuation of forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00), and a level of
assessment of sixteen percent (16%), shall have a market value of two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) ($40,000.00/0.16).

above or behind ground floor commercial, group assembly, and/or civic uses, and
may be designed to accommodate office and/or group assembly space on the second
level.
MODERATE CONFORMANCE: Project proposals shall be considered in moderate

MULTI-FAMILY STRUCTURE: A residence for multiple households where dwelling
units are located above or below one another and may share a common lobby
(synonym: condominiums and/or apartments).
PRECISE CONFORMANCE: Project proposals shall be considered in precise
conformance with this article when village staff determines that the plans
match the development or redevelopment scenario presented in this article,
including use, site plan, massing, and architectural details, and requires no
variances or other special approvals.

exterior surface that fronts a thoroughfare and extends from exterior grade to
the roofline. On interior and corner lots, the primary facade shall be the face
of the building used for its primary mailing address, as determined by village
staff.
PRIVATE FRONTAGE: The privately owned area between the front lot line of a
parcel and the building facade.
PUBLIC FRONTAGE OR PUBLIC PARKWAY: The publicly held area between the curb of
the thoroughfare and the front lot line of a parcel.
REDEVELOPMENT SITES: Those lots, structures, and uses that are subject to the
redevelopment requirements of the Route 50 corridor district. Property shall be
classified as a redevelopment site when it is part of a lot assemblage and/or
when voluntary, private owner initiated site improvements exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the property's market value. Redevelopment sites include those lots,
structures, and uses that did not lawfully exist prior to the adoption of this
article, those lots that are, at present, undeveloped, and those lots that lose
their status as grandfathered sites by operation of a provision of this
article.
SECONDARY FACADE: On corner lots, the secondary facade is the entire linear
exposed exterior surface that fronts a thoroughfare and extends from exterior
grade to the roofline, and is the face of the building not used as the primary
mailing address, as determined by village staff.
SINGLE-FAMILY ATTACHED STRUCTURE: A residence designed to house a single-family
unit from lowest level to roof, with a private outside entrance and a shared
common wall with an adjoining dwelling unit (synonyms: row house; townhouse).
SINGLE-FAMILY DETACHED STRUCTURE: A residence designed to house a single-family
unit only, and is separated from other dwelling units by open space.

      3.   General Provisions: All general provisions in this section shall
apply unless otherwise noted. (Ord. 12-34, 2-19-2013)
9-10C-3-2: USES:
   (A)   Permitted Uses: Permitted uses of structures and land as set forth in
this subsection shall be allowed according to the regulations set forth within
this district and each building form. Permitted uses may be approved by either
administrative review or by site plan review by the village board, depending on
the nature of the improvement. Only those uses listed in this subsection shall
be considered permitted uses and no structure or land shall be devoted to any
other use other than a use that is permitted here, with the exception of uses
that were lawfully established prior to the effective date hereof; and
accessory uses, in compliance with this article.
   Commercial:
      Retail/service. An enterprise that provides goods and/or services
directly to the customer, including, but not limited to, merchandise shops,
eating and drinking establishments, specialty goods/foods stores, financial

   Residential:
      Owner and renter occupied dwelling units located within single-family
detached or single-family attached units.
   (B)   Special Uses: Special uses of structures and land are set forth in
this subsection. Such special uses shall be deemed to be and shall be treated
as grandfathered sites hereunder and shall be governed by the applicable
regulations relating to this article. These uses create off site impacts or
design issues that require special consideration by the plan commission and
approval by the village board. Petitions for uses that are listed as special
uses shall be reviewed according to procedures set forth by the village. The
village board may impose conditions and restrictions upon the premises
benefitted by a special use as may be necessary to assure compliance with any
standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such a use on the other
properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of
this article. Failure to comply with conditions of a special use shall
constitute a violation of this article and may result in a revocation of the
special use. The special use will be enforced as the grantee continues to
occupy and/or operate said property. In the event of a transfer of property to
another party the special use expires and opportunity for granting the
continuing of the special use will be required by the new owner or operator.
      Amusement and recreation establishments including bowling alleys,
billiard parlors, coin operated amusement devices, swimming pools, dance halls,
skating rinks and other similar places of recreation.
      Any establishment with operating hours between two o'clock (2:00) A.M.

      Warehouse and storage facilities.
      Winery, distillery, or brewery, including sales and tasting.
   (C)   Prohibited Uses: Some uses that would otherwise be allowed in other
areas of the village shall not necessarily be allowed in the Route 50 corridor
district. This is because the nature of these uses is inconsistent with the
intent and purpose of this article. Any existing prohibited use may change
owner as long as no new prohibited use is created. Prohibited uses of land and
structures are listed in this subsection.
      Adult regulated uses - strip clubs, adult bookstore, etc.

   (D)   Nonconformities: This article is a significant departure from
traditional zoning. Typically nonconformities are encouraged to discontinue or
are required to be removed over a time period. However, the unique
characteristics of the Route 50 corridor district and this article demand a
more flexible approach to nonconformities. The significant contributions many
existing uses and structures have made toward establishing the Route 50
corridor district's identity require that they be treated in a manner that
respects their existing characteristics, but also aims to update these uses and
structures in a manner that also fulfills the vision of this article.
Therefore, existing sites have been identified as "grandfathered sites" within
this article. As these sites seek to redevelop, change ownership, and/or expand
(under 50 percent of market value based on most recent tax bill) a series of
criteria has been established that build upon the vision of this article,
without being overly burdensome to those that reside or conduct/own businesses
within this district. (Ord. 12-34, 2-19-2013)
9-10C-3-3: BUILDING STANDARDS:
   (A)   Intent: The intent of these building regulations is to establish
architectural standards for new construction projects as well as building
expansions.
   (B)   Applicability: The building standards herein shall apply to all
development types within the Route 50 corridor district.
   (C)   Building Types:
      1.   Mixed Use: A mixed use building contains residential dwelling units
above or behind ground floor commercial, group assembly, and/or civic uses, and
may be designed to accommodate office and/or group assembly space on the second
level.
      2.   Stand Alone Commercial: A stand alone commercial building contains
retail, office, group assembly, and/or civic uses on all levels of the
structure.
      3.   Multi-Family: A multi-family structure is a residence for multiple

department, public works, engineering, fire department, police department, and
the village's landscape consultants, if applicable. All staff reviews and
approvals will require an application and must be documented. Village staff may
require an improvement that qualifies for staff review to go through site plan
review by the plan commission if the application does not comply with the
standards herein or if village staff determines that the scope of the project
exceeds his/her administrative authority.
      2.   Site Plan Review By Village Board: Certain improvements require site
plan approval because of the proposed changes to the site or building and the
scope of the project. Site plan review by the village board typically involves
two (2) public meetings for review by the village board.
      3.   Site Plan Review By Plan Commission And Village Board: Certain
improvements require site plan review and approval by the plan commission and
village board because the application requires that an ordinance be considered.
Any public hearing required for approvals granted by the village board will be
held by the plan commission.
      4.   Site Plan Review By Planning Commission And Village Board With
Public Hearing Process: Any project requiring more than six (6) deviations,
special use, or PUD will require full approval process with public hearing.

9-10C-5-7: DEVIATIONS:
See section
9-10C-5-1, table 5.1.1 of this article.
   (A)   Additional Standards Specific To A Variance: The plan commission shall
not recommend a variance from the regulations of this article unless it shall
have made findings of fact, based upon evidence presented to it, in each
specific case that:
      1.   Property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted
to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in this
district.
      2.   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances.
      3.   The variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of
the locality.
      4.   There are practical difficulties or particular hardships that are
unique to the property such as:
         (a)   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the property creates a hardship upon the owner, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried
out;
         (b)   The conditions upon which the petition for a variance is based
would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning
classification;
         (c)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   The granting of the variance would not be detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the Route 50

light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase congestion in the
public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values in the neighborhood.
   (B)   Additional Standards Specific To A Parking Variance: The number of off
street automobile and/or bicycle parking spaces required may be reduced by a
variance reviewed by the plan commission and approved by the village board
following the variance standards in this section and when all of the following
standards are met:
      1.   The development does not have the benefit of shared or collective
parking;
      2.   The applicant proves that adequate parking exists for such use,
based on the unique number, type and use characteristics (i.e., peak hour or
day) of those businesses or residences that currently use such a lot;
      3.   A municipal parking lot exists within three hundred feet (300') of
the development that has adequate parking to accommodate all or a portion of
the number of required spaces for the use;
      4.   The owner of the building makes a payment equal to one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) per required automobile and bicycle parking space that
cannot be provided on the subject lot. The fees collected for the payment in
lieu of parking will be used only for the acquisition of land or construction
of municipally owned or leased off street parking facilities for automobiles or
bicycles; landscape or streetscape; bike trails, lanes, or paths; or
maintenance or illumination of off street parking facilities. (Ord. 12-34, 2-
19-2013)
9-10C-5-8: PARKING AGREEMENT STANDARDS AND WAIVERS:
   (A)   Additional Standards For Cross Parking And Cross Access Agreements:
Off street parking facilities for automobiles are encouraged to be provided for
collectively or shared. The plan commission must approve a shared parking
arrangement through site plan review and under the following conditions:
      1.   A shared parking analysis is conducted, following the standards of
the Urban Land Institute, and indicates that reduced parking standards between
uses can be supported because the hourly parking demand associated with each
business is different.
      2.   There is adequate parking proposed to serve each business sharing
the parking during the peak hour associated with each use.
      3.   There is a written acknowledgement from all property owners that are
party to the collective or shared parking that the shared parking approval will
only be recognized by the village if the current arrangements of commercial and
residential square footages on the property remain the same. If these
arrangements change by change of use or change of owner, expansion or
redevelopment, new parking improvements may be required.
      4.   The arrangement is formalized through officially recorded cross
access and cross parking agreements.
   (B)   Additional Standards Specific To A Parking Waiver: The number of off
street automobile or bicycle parking spaces required in the Route 50 corridor
district may be reduced by an administratively granted parking waiver approved
by village staff under the following conditions:
      1.   The waiver requested is for fifty percent (50%) or less of the total
required parking for the site to meet commercial automobile and/or bicycle
parking requirements.
      2.   The waiver is not for residential parking requirements. Residential
parking requirements cannot be waived.
      3.   A municipal lot exists within three hundred feet (300') of the
business that has adequate parking to accommodate all or a portion of the
number of required spaces for a new tenant or use or a public commuter parking
lot exists within three hundred feet (300') of the business and can be used on
weekends and weekdays (after 11:30 A.M.).
      4.   The development does not have the benefit of shared or collective

decision to the president and board of trustees for the village of Manteno.
Said appeal shall be filed in the office of the village clerk and stamped no

9-14-9: CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE:
(Rep. by Ord. 07-60, 2-19-2008)
9-14-10: VARIANCES:
   (A)   Authority: The planning commission, after a public hearing, shall
recommend to the village board, any variance of the regulations of this title.
Variance may be requested only in cases where there are practical difficulties
or particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this title relating to the use, construction or alterations of
buildings or structures or the use of land. The variance is intended as a
device for adjustment where this title creates unnecessary and undue hardship
in unusual cases, to give affected property owners rights as nearly equal as
possible to those of others in the same district. However, no variance shall be
granted under this section to allow a structure or use in a district restricted
against such structure or use. Variance may be recommended only where such
commission makes findings of fact in accordance with the standards hereinafter
prescribed, and further, finds that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this title.
   (B)   Application And Notice Of Hearing: An application for a variation
shall be filed in writing with the code enforcement officer. The application
shall contain such information as the planning commission and village board
may, by rule, require. Notice of the time and place of such public hearing
shall be published at least once in the official newspaper not more than thirty
(30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Findings: The planning commission shall not recommend to vary the
provisions of this title as authorized in this section, unless it shall have
made findings based upon the evidence presented regarding the following points:
(Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
      1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning districts. In
addition:
         (a)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same district and the same vicinity. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
         (b)   The condition or situation of the property is not of so general
or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a
general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this title. (In such cases,
the commission shall take steps to initiate consideration of such an
amendment.) (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
      2.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant or by any person presently having an interest in the
property.
         (a)   The hardship is created by the physical character of the
property, including dimensions, topography, or soil conditions, or by other
extraordinary situation or condition of such property.
         (b)   Self-inflicted or personal hardship shall not be considered as
grounds for a variance, since the variance will continue to affect the
character of the neighborhood after title to the property has passed.
      3.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege or convenience that is denied by this title to
other lands, buildings, or structures in the same zoning district.
      4.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this title would
deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the
same zoning district under the terms of this title and would work unnecessary
and undue hardship on the applicant.
      5.   That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
      6.   That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general intent and purpose of this title and that such variance will not be
injurious to the public welfare. Further, that the granting of the variance
will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property values and that the
character of the district will not be changed by such granting. (Ord. 99-06, 6-
21-1999)
   (D)   Conditions And Safeguards: In recommending the granting of any
variance, the commission may specify appropriate conditions, safeguards and
restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to
comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the
effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and to
implement the general purpose and intent of this title. Violation of such
conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this title.
   (E)   Restrictions: Under no circumstances except as permitted above shall
the commission recommend to grant a variance to permit a use not generally or
by special exception permitted in the zoning district involved or any use
expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this title in the zoning
district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings
in the same zoning district and no permitted use of lands, structures, or
buildings in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the
authorization of a variance. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-
2005)
   (F)   Effective Period: No order of the village board granting a variation
shall be valid for a period longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the
date of such order, unless a building permit is obtained within such period and
the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is commenced
within such period. The village board may grant one extension, valid for no
more than one hundred eighty (180) additional days, upon written application
and good cause shown, without notice or hearing, provided such application is
received before the expiration of the original effective period. If any of the
benefits conferred by a variation, whether heretofore or hereafter granted, are
abandoned, or are not utilized for any continuous period of one year, said
variation shall, to the extent of such abandonment or nonutilization, become
valid only after a public hearing as provided herein. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
   (G)   Decisions: Not more than sixty (60) days after the close of the public
hearing, the planning commission shall make its findings of fact and its
recommendation, in writing, to the village board. The concurring vote of four
(4) members of the commission shall be necessary to grant a variance. The
village board may, through a motion passed by a majority of votes, accept or
reject the recommendation of the planning commission. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999;
amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
9-14-11: APPEALS:
   (A)   Authority: The planning commission shall hear and make recommendations
to the village board from an administrative order, requirement or determination
under this title.
   (B)   Scope Of Appeals: An appeal, in which it is alleged that there is
error in any decision made by the code enforcement officer under this title,
may be taken to the planning commission by any person or governmental agency
aggrieved by such decision or by any department, or officer of the village.
Such an appeal shall be taken and filed with the village clerk within twenty
(20) days from the date of the action on which the appeal is taken specifying
the grounds thereof. The appeal shall specify the alleged error or errors in
such order, requirement, decision, or determination. The village clerk shall,
without delay, forward to the commission a copy of the notice of appeal
together with all the records pertaining to the decision on which the appeal is
made.
   (C)   Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the decision appealed unless the code enforcement officer
certifies to the planning commission after the notice of the appeal has been
filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In this event,
the proceedings shall not be stayed unless by a restraining order, which may be
granted by the commission or by a court of record on application, on notice to
the code enforcement officer and on due cause shown.
   (D)   Hearing: The planning commission shall render a written recommendation
on the appeal within a reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60)
days after the closing of the public hearing, and shall promptly forward a copy
of the recommendation to the village board. The village board may affirm or may
reverse, wholly or in part, or modify the decision of the code enforcement
officer, as in its opinion ought to be done, and to that end shall have the
powers of the code enforcement officer. All decisions of the village board
shall, in all instances, be final administrative determinations and shall be
subject to judicial review only in accordance with applicable Illinois
statutes. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
9-14-12: SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
   (A)   Purpose: This title is based upon the division of the village into
districts, within which the use of land, and the uses of bulk of buildings and
structures, are substantially uniform. However, within the village generally,
or within certain zoning districts, certain uses specified in this title are of
a nature requiring special and intensive review to determine whether they
should be permitted in specified locations, and to identify the special
conditions and safeguards which should be applied if permission is granted in
such locations. Special use procedures as provided herein are intended to
assure that such review is made and that appropriate conditions and safeguards
are attached. Special use procedures shall be applied, and special exceptions
granted, only as, and in cases, specified in this title.
   (B)   Categories: It is recognized that there are special uses which,
because of their unique characteristics, can only be properly classified in any
particular district or districts upon consideration in each case of the impact
of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular
use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into three (3)
categories:
      1.   Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public
interest;
      2.   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature
that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property, public facilities, or the village as a whole;
and
      3.   Uses, either public or private, that because of past or present
conditions, need special consideration. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
   (C)   Authority: Special use permits shall be reviewed and heard by the
planning commission, but only in accordance with the requirements hereinafter
set forth. The planning commission shall make their recommendations to the
village board.
   (D)   Application And Notice Of Hearing: An application for a special use
permit shall be filed with the code enforcement officer, who shall forward a
copy of the application to the planning commission. The application shall be in
such form, contain such information, and be accompanied by such plans, as the
village board, planning commission, or code enforcement officer may deem
appropriate. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at
least once, not less than fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30) days before
the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The
published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the
board may provide by rule. The appellant shall have notified all adjoining
owners by certified letter, return receipt requested, at least five (5) days
prior to the hearing. The letter shall indicate the time, place and date of the
public hearing and give a description of the request. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999;
amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
   (E)   Application Standards: The application shall contain the following
information:
      1.   The extent to which the proposed special use departs from the zoning
and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property,
including, but not limited to, the density, dimensions, area, bulk, and uses,
and the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest.
      2.   In what respects the proposed special use meets the requirements and
standards of the special use regulations.
      3.   The method by which the proposed special use makes adequate
provisions for public services, provided adequate control over vehicular
traffic, provides for and protects designated, common open space and furthers
the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment.
      4.   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed special use to
adjacent properties and neighborhoods.
      5.   The desirability of the proposed special use to physical
development, tax base and economic well being of the village.
      6.   The conformity with the intent and spirit of the comprehensive plans
of the village. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
   (F)   Recommendation By The Planning Commission: Within sixty (60) days
after the close of the hearing, unless the applicant shall have consented to a
longer period, the commission shall transmit to the village board a written
report giving its findings and recommendations for special use permits issued,
and on the restrictions to be imposed upon the premises benefited by the
special use permit. Where the special use is denied, the record of the
commission shall set forth, and the applicant shall receive notice of, the
specific grounds for denial.
   (G)   Action By The Commission, Findings Required:
      1.   Before granting any application for a special use, the commission
shall make written findings that it is empowered under specified sections of
this title to grant the special use and that the granting of the exception will
not adversely affect the public interest. The commission shall also make
written findings certifying compliance with the specific rules and requirements
governing individual special uses, and that, where applicable, satisfactory
provision and arrangement has been made concerning the following: (Ord. 99-06,
6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
         (a)   Ingress and egress to the property and proposed structures or
uses thereon, with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and
convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or
catastrophe.
         (b)   Off street parking and loading areas, where required, with
particular attention to the items in subsection (G)1(a) of this section.
         (c)   Refuse and service areas.
         (d)   Control of noise, glare, odor, or other potentially adverse
effects of the proposed use on nearby property, and screening or buffering to
alleviate such effects. Control of drainage and erosion.
         (e)   Utilities, with reference to location, availability and
potentially adverse appearance or other effects on surroundings.
         (f)   Signs and lighting, with reference to glare, traffic safety, and
compatibility and harmony with adjoining properties and the character of the
area.
         (g)   Required yards and other open spaces.
      2.   No special use permit will be granted unless:
         (a)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
         (b)   The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment
of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted,
nor substantially diminish and impair values within the neighborhood.
         (c)   The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal
and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
      3.   The special use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulation of the district in which it is located, except as such
regulations may in each instance be modified by the village board pursuant to
the recommendation of the planning commission.
   (H)   Conditions And Safeguards: The commission may impose such conditions
relating to the special use as it may deem necessary in the particular case to
protect the public interest, in relation to the items listed at subsection (G)1
of this section and as may otherwise be reasonably necessary, and may require a
guarantee or bond to ensure continued compliance with such conditions and
continued maintenance of such safeguards. Violations of conditions or
safeguards lawfully attached to any special use shall be deemed violations of
this title. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-16-2005)
   (I)   Special Exceptions Apply To Property, Not Person: When granted, a
special exception, together with any conditions or safeguards attached, shall
apply to the land, structure or use for which it was issued, and not to a
particular person. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)
   (J)   Withdrawal Of Application; Rehearing If Withdrawn Or Denied: An
application for a special use may be withdrawn at any time, but if withdrawn
after the commission has convened the public hearing at which it was to be
considered, or if denied by the village board, substantially the same
application shall not be considered within twenty four (24) months from the
date of the withdrawal or denial. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999; amd. Ord. 05-01, 5-
16-2005)
9-14-13: AMENDMENTS:
   (A)   Authority: The regulations and districts established by this title may
be amended from time to time by the village board through the enactment of an
amending ordinance. No such amendment shall be made without a public hearing
before the planning commission and a report of findings and recommendations
submitted to the village board by the planning commission.
   (B)   Initiation: Amendments may be proposed by the village board, planning
commission, code enforcement officer, and by any other person, firm or
corporation having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to
exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold
interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest in which
is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application
for an amendment.
No application for amendment to this title shall be made which proposes
reclassification of any of the same property within any zoning district that
has been subject of a public hearing held by the planning commission within
twenty four (24) months preceding the date of filing.
   (C)   Processing: The process for obtaining an amendment shall be as
follows:
      1.   An application for an amendment shall be filed with the code
enforcement officer and thereafter entered into the records of the first
meeting thereafter of the village board. The application shall be in such form
as to contain such information and be accompanied by such plans as the planning
commission and village board by rule may require.
      2.   A copy of such application shall thereafter be forwarded by the code
enforcement officer to the planning commission with a request to hold a public
hearing.
      3.   The planning commission shall hold a public hearing within ninety
(90) days after receiving the application from the code enforcement officer.
Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once,
not less than fifteen (15) nor more than thirty (30) days before the hearing in
a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The published notice may be

(5) days prior to the hearing. The letter shall indicate the time, place and
date of the public hearing and give a description of the request.
      4.   The planning commission shall, within sixty (60) days after the
hearing, transmit a written report giving its findings and recommendations to
the village board.
   (D)   Review Consideration:
      1.   In reviewing an amendment, the planning commission shall give
careful attention to the following:
         (a)   The effect of the proposed amendments on the comprehensive
planning of the entire village.
         (b)   The changes in community characteristics that may take place
because of the projected change.
         (c)   The relative effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the present
wording of the ordinance, and whether a justification for change exists because
of either special reasons or a change in conditions.
         (d)   Whether the amendment is designed to correct an improper
situation or would result merely in the granting of special privileges.
      2.   Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to change
the zoning classification of particular property, the planning commission shall
make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specified case
with respect to the following matters in addition to all points listed above:
         (a)   Existing uses of property within the general area of the
property in question.
         (b)   The zoning classification of property within the general area of
the property in question.
         (c)   The suitability of the property in question for the use
permitted under the existing zoning classification.
         (d)   The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the
property in question, including changes, if any, which may have taken place
since the day the property in question was placed in its present zoning
classification.
         (e)   Conformance or nonconformance with officially adopted plans of
the village.
         (f)   The proposed amendment is in the public interest and is not
solely for the interest of the applicant.
   (E)   Decisions: The village board, upon recommendation of the planning
commission, may grant or deny any proposed amendment in accordance with
applicable Illinois statutes, or may refer it back to the planning commission
for further consideration.
In cases of written protest against any proposed amendment, signed and
acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to
be altered or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately
adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered,
such amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of five (5)
members of the village board.
If no action is taken by the village board within six (6) months after the
report of the planning commission, the application shall be deemed to have been
denied and shall not thereafter be granted. (Ord. 99-06, 6-21-1999)

10-4-7: RESUBDIVISION EXCEPTION:
   (A)   Expedited Subdivision Approval: Under the following circumstances, an
owner of land otherwise exempt from the platting requirements codified in the
Plat Act, may divide a legal and previously subdivided lot into four (4) lots
or less without complying with the full subdivision approval process prescribed
by this title if the division does not:
      1.   Alter existing infrastructure or involve additional infrastructure;
      2.   Involve road improvements;
      3.   Involve easements of access;
      4.   Create lots that violate or necessitate a variance to comply with
the code provisions applicable to the zoning district in which the lots are
located.
   (B)   Final Resubdivision Plat Application: The owner of land seeking to
divide a legal and previously subdivided lot under this section shall file an
application for approval of the division with the village clerk, accompanied by
the appropriate platting fee, and the following documents:
      1.   Ten (10) full size, twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch (24" x 36")
copies of the plat of survey for the division; and
      2.   One full size, twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch (24" x 36") copy
of the final plat of subdivision and any existing covenants or restrictions for
the subdivision previously approved for the subdivision in which the lot is
situated; and
      3.   Ten (10) copies of documentation including, but not limited to,
proposed covenants or restrictions, which shall address future maintenance of
common areas, structures, private infrastructure, or any other shared
components; and
      4.   Such other documentation requested by the village administrator.

10-5-1: INTENT:
It is the intent of the following standards to provide for the thorough,
relatively uniform presentation of pertinent development information by
developers or others wishing to alter the present condition of real property.
It is the intent of these standards to provide clear documentary evidence of
what currently exists, what is proposed, what is constructed, and what all
parties agree to. It is the intent of these standards to provide for the
control of physical aspects of documentary material so that such material may
be conveniently archived by the village. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-5-2: APPLICABILITY:
These standards and specifications shall apply to the documentation for all
subdivision and development activities within the village and within the one
and one-half (11/2) mile jurisdictional area surrounding the village with the
exception of architectural drawings having to do specifically with proposed
buildings or like structures. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-5-3: DOCUMENT SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS:
Documents shall conform to the following standards:
   (A)   Plans shall be presented in a clear and concise manner. Any submittals
forwarded to the village for review which, in the opinion of the village
engineer or village administrator, are not complete, will not be reviewed. If
plans are not reviewed, a letter will be sent to the developer's engineer
stating that the plans have not met the minimum village standards, and the time
period for a review has not started. Any review fees incurred for an incomplete
submittal will be charged to the developer and paid from the development escrow
as stated in section
10-3-9, "Fees", of this title.
   (B)   Documents that are primarily written, forms, correspondence, etc.,
shall be eight and one-half inches by eleven inches (81/2" x 11") except
certain legal documents may be eight and one-half inches by fourteen inches
(81/2" x 14").
   (C)   Plats and plans shall be standard size sheets (approximately 24 inches
x 36 inches) unless otherwise approved by the village engineer, village planner
and/or village administrator.
   (D)   Plans shall also be submitted to the village in an electronic format
acceptable to the village. The plans shall be generated with details as
specified by the village. The required information is available from the
village engineer in electronic format.
   (E)   Documents, plats, and plans that consist of more than one sheet shall
be bound at the top or left side. Bound sheets shall have a margin of one and
one-half inches (11/2") to two inches (2") on the bound side.
   (F)   Certain incidental documentation such as letters of transmittal,
receipts, etc., may vary from the above standards and specifications. Some of
the sketches or other early drawing items required in the conceptual stage of a
project may also vary from the above standards and specifications except that
no conceptual stage documentation shall be smaller than eight and one-half
inches by eleven inches (81/2" x 11").
   (G)   Documents that are eleven inches by seventeen inches (11" x 17") shall
be folded to eight and one-half inches by eleven inches (81/2" x 11").
   (H)   Information conveyed by radio, telephone or other verbal methods shall
not be considered binding unless documentation is also provided. The intent of
this provision is to encourage the conveyance of important information by
documentation so each transaction is as clear and unambiguous as possible.
   (I)   Documents conveyed through the use of facsimile transceivers are to be
considered as less binding than conveyance of original signature documents by
mail or by hand delivery. Legal documents involving the village shall all be
original signature documents. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-5-4: SKETCH PLAN DOCUMENTS:
   (A)   Purpose And Objective: The purpose of sketch plan documentation is to
establish where the proposed project is located, whether the applicant owns or
is allowed to develop the property in question, the type and scope of the
project, and any potential problems with construction in the area of the
project. This information will determine whether or not the proposed project is
feasible, what level of planning will be necessary, the logistics related to
planning and constructing the proposed project, possible problems to be
addressed, and the level of village involvement that will be required. Sketch
plan approval does not grant the developer relief or variance from subdivision
and zoning standards and requirements.
   (B)   Required Documents: Twenty (20) copies of the following shall be
submitted to the village clerk:
      1.   Evidence Of Ownership: The applicant shall provide evidence of
ownership or evidence of approval of the owner to develop the proposed project
site. If the ownership is in a trust, the applicant shall provide the name of
the trustee(s), the name of the trust beneficiary(ies), and the trust number.
The applicant must also state the interest the applicant has in the property,
i.e., attorney/client privilege, an option to purchase, direct ownership, etc.
      2.   Location Map: The applicant shall provide a map showing the location
of the proposed project site as well as nearby transportation routes and other
significant features. The location map shall include a north arrow, title, bar
scale, and date.
      3.   Concept Plan: The applicant shall provide the general concept plan
at one inch equals two hundred feet (1" = 200') scale, colored to designate
requested zoning and open space. This plan shall include lot numbering and
street layout to allow an overall view of the development.
      4.   Topographical Plat: The applicant shall provide a topographical plat
of the proposed project site showing all existing zoning, land use, land
characteristics, woods, wetlands, floodplains, pertinent nearby municipal
improvements, public utilities, easements, buildings, etc., in and within two
hundred fifty feet (250') of the site. The topographical plat shall include a
north arrow, title, bar scale and date. The scale (1:20, 1:40, 1:50, 1:100) of
the plat shall be appropriate to the size of the site and/or as requested by
the village. Contours shall be at no more than one foot (1') intervals and
shall be based on bench mark elevations using the USGS datum. Portions of this
provision may be waived at the option of the village engineer, village planner
and/or village administrator based on the scope of the proposed project. The
village may require additional topographical data, particularly if there
appears to be problems with drainage.
      5.   Site Plan: The applicant shall provide a series of drawings or
sketches made on copies of the topographical plat showing the proposed layout
of streets, lots, and site improvements in relation to the existing features,
showing the following:
         (a)   Boundary lines of the site with dimensions.
         (b)   Proposed lots, easements, building setback lines, building
locations and separations, and pedestrian considerations, with the approximate
dimensions of each lot as well as size shown in square feet and in acres. Lots
shall be numbered for the whole development in a consecutive and logical order.
         (c)   Proposed street layout, sidewalks, off street parking, loading
spaces, fire lanes, and exterior street improvements such as turning lanes. All
proposed streets shall also indicate widths.
         (d)   Proposed open spaces, school sites, park sites, and private
recreation facilities.
         (e)   Zoning of lots and of all adjoining areas.
         (f)   Alternate designs or layouts with only enough detail to make the
alternatives understandable.
         (g)   Proposed drainage and storm water detention/retention locations
including a narrative describing how storm water runoff control will be
provided for.
         (h)   Proposed sewer and water locations.
      6.   Land Use Schedule: The following information shall be provided on
the plan maps or other documents submitted:
         (a)   Total acreage of site.
         (b)   Proposed land use by acreage, units and percent of total. For
park and school areas, include required acreage as well as proposed acreage.
         (c)   Proposed gross, net residential density for residential portions
of the proposed project.
         (d)   Proposed floor area ratio and land coverage in percent for
nonresidential portions of the proposed project.
      7.   Subdivision And Street Naming:
         (a)   New subdivisions will provide a theme unused in other
subdivisions for determining street names within the subdivision. The intent is
to establish unique identification of the subdivision through the theme and
street names. Repetition of portions of existing subdivision names shall not be
allowed (such as Brookridge, Brook Fields, Brookgate, Stonebrook, etc.).
Repetition creates confusion for residents and emergency personnel. Both the
theme and actual street names are subject to approval of the village of
Manteno, and must be permanently identified prior to preliminary plat approval.
         (b)   New street names shall not duplicate the themes or names of
existing streets, but streets that are continuations of others already in
existence and named shall bear the name of the existing street.
         (c)   A street running in one direction will have one name only and
should have the same name throughout its entire length.
         (d)   A street which jogs sharply shall be given a different name
beginning at the location of the jog and continuing in the different direction.
The angle of deviation and the distance for which it continues will be
determining factors for a name change requirement.
         (e)   If a street ends in a backtracking curve, that circle, loop,
bend or way may be designated with the same name as the main street. Example:
Leahy Circle is off of the dead end Leahy Avenue; White Tail Bend is at the end
of White Tail Drive.
         (f)   Definitions:
            AVENUE: Street running east-west.
               BEND: Sharp "U" at end of a street.
               BOULEVARD: Street divided by a landscaped center island.

terminate on the same road.
               COURT: Permanently closed street such as a cul-de-sac.
               DRIVE: Winding thoroughfare that meanders about and continues
through to other rights of way.
               LANE: Minor street less than one thousand feet (1,000').
               PARKWAY: Unusually wide, scenic thoroughfare with shade trees
and shrubbery in the center plat, or sided on at least one side by a park,
waterway or wooded area for its entire length.
               PATH: Minor diagonal street, usually between a north-south
street and an east-west avenue.
               PLACE: A short curvilinear or diagonal street or a cul-de- sac
or permanent dead end road.
               ROAD: Diagonal, frequently used street, longer than one thousand
feet (1,000'), connecting with primary streets.
               RUN: Minor diagonal street or one which changes direction.
               STREET: Street running north-south.

change direction. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-5-5: PRELIMINARY PLAT, PLAN AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS:
   (A)   Purpose And Objective: The purpose of preliminary stage documentation
is to establish planning and design solutions to the problems posed by the
project as conceived. In this stage, other agencies will be provided the
opportunity to comment on the project from their own perspective. The village
will finalize its requirements related to the project and will review the
proposed planning and design solutions.
   (B)   Preliminary Plat And Plan: When any owner of land lying within the
corporate limits of the village of Manteno or within one and one-half (11/2)
miles of the corporate limits desires to subdivide such lands, the owner shall
submit to the village administrator twenty (20) standard size copies and one
eleven inch by seventeen inch (11" x 17") copy of:
      1.   Preliminary plat drawn to a scale of not less than one inch equals
one hundred feet (1" = 100') with supporting sheets which shall constitute a
part thereof, and
      2.   Preliminary engineering improvement plan drawn at a scale of not
less than one inch equals one hundred feet (1" = 100') showing all proposed
improvements. The preliminary plat shall show all land owned, options, or
proposed to be developed by the subdivider. Such plat and plan shall show and
give the following information.

preliminary grading or for the construction of public improvements, the
developer shall deliver to the Village a fully executed performance guarantee
in the amount of one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the total estimated
costs of completion of all public improvements as determined by the Village
Engineer, whether or not completed at such time. Such guarantee shall be
subject to the approval of the Village Attorney, and shall be in one of the
following forms: 1) an irrevocable letter of credit for the benefit of the
Village; or 2) a cash escrow agreement or other financial assurance acceptable
to the Village.
   (B)   Letter Of Credit Requirements: Each letter of credit shall be issued
by a sound and reputable banking or financing institution authorized to do
business in the State of Illinois in favor of the Village. The letter of credit
shall specify that its purpose is to guarantee developer's completion of all
public improvements of the subdivision as depicted in the final plat and site
improvement plans approved by the Village. The letter of credit shall specify
that said funds are available at the surety, to be drawn upon by the Village at
sight, without notice to, or consent of, the developer. The letter of credit
shall be valid and shall not expire for a minimum of two (2) years or such
longer period as shall be jointly agreed. Notwithstanding the expiry date, the
letter of credit shall provide that it shall not expire, and will continue to
be valid and honored until, the later of the expiration date or ninety (90)

for final approval. No reduction, however, shall reduce the performance
guarantee below the greatest of twenty five percent (25%) of the original
guarantee or the cost to complete any remaining improvements as determined by
the Village Engineer taking into account any increased costs of construction.
Reduction in performance guarantee does not constitute formal acceptance of any
part of the development and therefore does not mark the beginning of the
required two (2) year warranty period for individual improvements. (Ord. 17-26,
12-18-2017)
10-6-9: FINAL INSPECTION:

Village Engineer shall submit an approval letter to the Board of Trustees
recommending acceptance of the public improvements. If not already done, the
Village shall record the final plat of subdivision. The Board of Trustees shall
accept any land dedicated on the final plat of subdivision, and any personal
property conveyed by bill of sale, by resolution. The Village shall release any
remaining balance of the developer's original performance guarantee upon
acceptance of the public improvements. No public improvements shall be accepted

10-8-5: BLOCK STANDARDS:
   (A)   Determination Of Block Dimensions: The length, widths, and shapes of
blocks shall be determined with due regard to:
      1.   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated.
      2.   Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions within the
corporate limit of the village of Manteno.
      3.   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of
pedestrian and street traffic.
      4.   Limitations and opportunities of topography.
   (B)   Block Dimension Restrictions: The length, width, and shape of blocks
shall be such as are appropriate for the locality and the type of development
contemplated, but block length in residential areas shall not be less than four
hundred feet (400') nor exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200'), nor have
less than sufficient width to provide two (2) tiers of lots of appropriate
depth between street lines, except for blocks with one tier of lots which meet
the double frontage requirements of this title.
   (C)   Block Length: Block length is determined by the distance along a
roadway beginning at the intersection with one through street and ending at the
intersection with another separate through street. An eyebrow, cul-de-sac or
change of direction on a single stretch of roadway does not constitute an
intersection or a separate through street.
   (D)   Pedestrian Crosswalks: Pedestrian crosswalk rights of way not less
than twelve feet (12') wide shall be required at centers of blocks having a
length in excess of nine hundred feet (900') and where deemed necessary by the
plan commission to provide for pedestrian circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation and other community facilities.
   (E)   Blocks Located In Industrial/Commercial Areas: Blocks or portions
thereof intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designated as such
and the plans shall show adequate off street areas to provide for parking,
loading docks, and other such facilities, as provided in the village zoning
ordinance. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-8-6: LOT STANDARDS:
   (A)   Lot Arrangement: The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography, soils, flooding or
other conditions, in securing permits to build on all lots in compliance with
the zoning ordinance, the floodplain ordinance, and wastewater treatment and
disposal system rules and regulations. Subdivisions shall contain no leftover
pieces, corners, or remnants of land. Lots shall not cross municipal nor county
boundary lines.
   (B)   Lot Size Requirements:
      1.   Lot dimensions and areas within the village corporate limits and the
one and one-half (11/2) mile jurisdictional boundary shall conform to the
requirements of the village zoning ordinance. If the appropriate county zoning
ordinance is more restrictive with regard to a lot in the one and one-half (11/
2) mile jurisdictional boundary, then the county zoning ordinance shall apply.
No lot shall be created for residential or nonresidential use that does not
comply with the minimum lot area and width of the zoning district in which it
is located, unless otherwise granted as part of a planned development or
special use.
      2.   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A proportion
of two and one-half to one (21/2:1) shall normally be considered a desirable
maximum.
      3.   Lots shall be of sufficient size and area to provide for all
required activities such as, but not limited to, parking and loading as
required by the zoning ordinance.
      4.   Angular lots in residential zones shall be a minimum width of
seventy feet (70') measured at the building setback line.
   (C)   Lots Affected By Surface Water:
      1.   Lots abutting a storm water retention/detention pond, watercourse,
drainageway or easement, channel or stream shall have a minimum width or depth
as required to provide an adequate building site and to afford the minimum
usable area required in this title or the Manteno zoning ordinance for front,
side and rear yards.
      2.   Watercourses, stream channels, floodways and water storage areas
shall not be included in the computation of required lot areas where it is
proposed that such watercourses are to traverse the lot interiors. Whenever
possible, lot lines shall center on said watercourses.
   (D)   Lot Drainage: Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all building sites and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area.
   (E)   Proximity To Dedicated Street: All lots, tracts and parcels shall
front on a publicly dedicated street as required by the village zoning
ordinance. Residential lots which abut upon major streets shall also abut upon
a local street. Vehicular access to such lots shall be to the local street
only.
   (F)   Double And Reverse Frontage: Reverse frontage lots are forbidden.
Double frontage lots are forbidden except where lots back upon an arterial or
major collector street; and in such instance, vehicular access between the lots
and the primary street is prohibited.
   Double frontage lots are forbidden except in instances where the plan
commission considers such arrangement as essential to provide separation of
residential development from highways or primary thoroughfares or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. In such instances, a
planting screen easement of at least thirty feet (30'), and across which there
shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be provided along the line of lots
abutting such highways and primary thoroughfares or other disadvantageous use.
Said easement shall be fully landscaped by the developer and conveyed to a
homeowners' association for future maintenance responsibility or, at discretion
of village, a special service area created to maintain said easements.
   (G)   Side Lot Line: Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles
or radial to the front lot line and/or at right angles to the back lot line.
   (H)   Corner Lots: Corner lots shall be sized to accommodate the building
setback lines on both streets as set forth in the zoning ordinance. A corner
lot shall be deemed to have two (2) front yards, with the required building
setback line in effect for all structure placement. The classification of the
remaining two (2) yards shall be determined by the location of the front door
entrance, and each yard shall begin no closer to the street than the building
setback line. The rear yard shall be the yard opposite of the front door
entrance and the remaining yard shall be considered a side yard. In instances
where the front door entrance is not clearly identifiable, the final
determination shall be made by the director of building and zoning.
   (I)   Flag Lots: Lots which meet the minimum area and dimension provisions
of the zoning ordinance except that the buildable portion of the lot is
accessible to a street right of way by means of a narrow strip of land shall be
prohibited unless otherwise approved by the village. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-8-7: EASEMENTS:
   (A)   Utility Easements: Easements for the installation, operation and
maintenance of utilities shall be provided as follows:
      1.   Public utility easements shall be provided along all boundary lines
of the subdivision, along all back of lot lines, and other locations as
required. If landscape or drainage easements are required, the public utility
easements shall be located closer to the front of the lot, with the landscape
or drainage easement along the rear of the lot. Public utility easements shall
have a width of not less than twelve feet (12'). After the public utility
easement subgrade has been prepared, acceptable topsoil material shall be
placed to a minimum depth of six inches (6") and brought to final grade prior
to installation of the public utilities.
      2.   Separate and exclusive easements shall be provided for village
utilities such as sanitary sewer, storm sewer, and streetlights. Village
utility easements, except streetlight easements, shall have a minimum width of
twelve feet (12') or shall be based upon one and one-half (11/2) the depth of
the utility, whichever is greater. Streetlight easements shall have a width of
ten feet (10'). Village utility easements may be combined, if approved by the
village engineer, and if enough width is provided to allow proper separation of
the utilities.
      3.   Where possible, easements shall be centered on lot lines, such that
half of the easement is on two (2) abutting lots. If public utility and village
utility easements are adjacent to each other where two (2) lots abut, each
easement shall be entirely in one lot.
      4.   All utility easements shall be laid out so as to provide continuity
from block to block.
      5.   On wooded sites, utility easements shall be located and be of
sufficient width so as to minimize environmental damage.
      6.   Utility easements and any easement provisions to be incorporated
into the final plat or in the deed documents shall be reviewed and approval by
the utility companies responsible to furnish the proposed services. The wording
of the utility easement certificate on the final plat shall be approved by the
village administrator and the village engineer.
   (B)   Utility Transmission Easements: The area contained in utility
transmission easements (those utility lines crossing or serving an area larger
than the village) shall not count towards the minimum lot width, depth, or
area. In addition, the lot setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the
utility transmission easement within the lot, and not the lot line itself.
Encroachment of any type - digging, over digging, structure placement,
landscaping, grading changes, etc. - is not allowed into the utility
transmission easement without written approval from the affected utility.
   (C)   Drainage And Storm Water Management Easements:
      1.   The area contained in drainage easements shall not count towards the
minimum lot width, depth, or area. In addition, the lot setbacks shall be
measured from the edge of the drainage easement within the lot, and not the lot
line itself. Encroachment of any type - digging, over digging, structure
placement, landscaping, grading changes, etc. - is not allowed into the
drainage easement. The village may require the developer to provide concrete
bottoms to drainage easements prior to acceptance of subdivision improvements.
      2.   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream, or other body of water, appropriate dedications or
easements, with adequate width to accommodate observed computed or anticipated
storm water drainage through and from the subdivision, shall be made. The width
of the easement or dedication shall be dependent on the area of land drained by
the watercourse and shall allow access for construction and maintenance
equipment. In general the easement shall conform substantially with the lines
of the watercourse and shall include the floodplain, where applicable, plus an
additional area not less than twenty feet (20') wide adjoining both edges of
the floodplain.
      3.   All permanent storm water management facilities for a subdivision
shall be protected by easements or dedications for drainage and shall permit
ingress and egress for maintenance. If required, all lot lines adjacent to
nonsubdivided lands shall have a drainage easement to direct the off site flow
through the development.
      4.   No construction of structure, dams, embankments or channels (except
as indicated on the improvement plans) and no planting of trees, shrubbery or
other vegetation, which hinder the flow of water or otherwise inhibit the
intended purposes, shall be allowed within any drainage or storm water
management facility easement. In the event the area within such easements is
obstructed, reshaped, regraded or restricted for uses other than as intended or
as shown on the improvement plans, the village will cause to have any
alterations corrected at the expense of the party or parties causing said
obstruction, restriction, regrading, or alteration.
      5.   Drainage easements shall be separate and distinct from utility
easements.
      6.   Drainage and storm water management easements shall be adequately
maintained so as to provide for removal of accumulation of vegetation, silt,
debris or other material that may interfere with the flow characteristics of
drainageways or the essential features of retention or detention facilities.
Drainage and storm water management easements shall be seeded and lined with
silt fence prior to village acceptance.
      7.   When a subdivision drainage plan proposes, and the village approves,
use of retention basins or ponds which are to be dedicated for public use, a
public access easement shall be provided to connect the facility to a public
street.
   (D)   Landscaping And Conservation Easements:
      1.   A screen planting easement shall be required between residential and
commercial or industrial lots or along lot lines to discourage the undesirable
development of residential lots fronting on traffic arteries. If such easement
is to be used for public utilities, the easement shall be of sufficient width
to accommodate appropriate screen planting without interfering with utility
service or maintenance.
      2.   Easements shall be required to protect areas designated for the
restoration of site flora as referenced in the village zoning ordinance
requirements for greenbelt and open space protection.
      3.   Said easements shall be fully landscaped by the developer and
conveyed to a homeowners' association for future maintenance responsibility or,
at discretion of village, a special service area created to maintain said
easements.
   (E)   Temporary Turnaround Easements: Temporary easements shall be provided
for construction of temporary turnarounds on streets which are designed to have
temporary terminus and are to be extended in the future. When the street is
extended, said temporary easements shall be considered voided and released for
other uses and purposes.
   (F)   Pedestrianway Easements: Easements or dedications shall be provided
for pedestrianways where deemed appropriate by the village plan commission.
Pedestrianway easements shall be maintained to permit their continued use.
   (G)   Line Of Sight Easements At Intersections: At all intersections, line
of sight easements shall be granted to the village to protect clear sight
distance not to exceed two feet (2') above centerline grade within the
triangular area formed at the intersection of any street right of way lines by
a straight line drawn between said right of way lines at a distance along each
line of thirty feet (30') from their point of intersection. No obstructions
will be permitted within said easement that exceed two feet (2') above
centerline grade. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-8-8: BUILDING SETBACK LINES:
   (A)   Building setback lines in residential areas of new subdivisions shall
conform to the front yard provisions of the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   A corner lot shall maintain not less than the minimum building setback
lines required on both streets on which the lot abuts. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-8-9: STREETS AND ALLEYS:
The subdivision of land, including the arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade and location of all streets, alleys, or other land to be dedicated for
public use, shall conform to the standards and details of this title.

      3.   Excavation And Foundation:
         (a)   The trench shall be excavated so that the flow line of the
finished sewer shall be at the depth and grade shown on the approved plans. The
trench shall be at least twelve inches (12") wider than the external diameter
of the pipe. The width of the trench shall not exceed the external diameter of
the pipe by more than eighteen inches (18") at the top of the pipe.
         (b)   If the excavation is deeper than necessary, the foundation shall
be brought to proper grade by the addition of well compacted bedding material.
Where a firm foundation is not encountered at the grade established, due to
soft, spongy, or other unsuitable soil (unless other special construction
methods are called for on the plans or in the special provisions), all such
unsuitable soil under the pipe and for the width of the trench shall be removed
and replaced with well compacted bedding material.
         (c)   The pipe shall be laid so that it will be uniformly supported
and the entire length of the pipe barrel will have full bearing. No blocking of
any kind shall be used to adjust the pipe to grade except when used with
embedment in concrete.
      4.   Pipe Bedding And Backfilling:
         (a)   Four inches (4") of CA-7 material shall be used as bedding for
the storm sewer pipe, increased to eight inches (8") if rock is encountered.
         (b)   Backfill CA-7 material to the horizontal centerline of concrete
pipe and to six inches (6") above N-12 pipe in areas over two feet (2') away
from existing or proposed pavements, driveways, or sidewalks.
         (c)   Any pipe installed under or within two feet (2') of an existing
or proposed pavement, driveway, or sidewalk shall be backfilled with CA-
7 material at a one to one (1:1) slope from the edge of pavement, driveway, or

(10-gauge copper minimum) capable of detection by a cable locator and shall be
buried directly against pipe.
         (b)   Locating wire shall terminate at the top of each structure or
cleanout and be capable of extending six inches (6") above final grade. (Ord.
09-29, 2-1-2010)
   (G)   Sump Pump And Footing Tile Connections:
      1.   Discharge Of Water: No water from footing tiles or basement sumps
shall be pumped onto the ground surface. Such water shall be discharged
directly into the storm sewer system.
      2.   Discharge Pipe Material: Pipe material for discharge pipe from the
house and the secondary drainage system shall be PVC with a minimum SDR 35 ASTM
3034.
      3.   Discharge Line And Piping: The sump pump discharge line should come
out of the house above the ground, and turn downward using an elbow. It should
then extend just into a gravity receiving pipe that is sticking out of the
ground a few inches. The gravity pipe should be a four inch (4") diameter PVC.
Discharge piping from the house and the secondary drainage system shall be laid
on a uniform grade of one percent (1%) and a minimum depth of cover of three
feet (3').
      4.   Tap Into Storm Sewer Main: The tap into the storm sewer main should
be made based on the type of receiving storm sewer pipe as follows:
         (a)   N-12 Storm Sewer (Heavy Black Plastic Pipe With A Smooth
Interior): An Inserta-Tee by Advanced Drainage Systems shall be used for
connection of the four inch (4") PVC gravity sump pump line to the N-12 storm
pipe.
         (b)   Concrete Storm Sewer: A hole shall be sawed into the existing
concrete storm sewer or storm structure. Three (3) or four (4) galvanized metal
screws, a minimum of two inches (2") long, are to be installed in the end of
the four inch (4") PVC sump pump discharge pipe at a distance from the end
equal to the thickness of the concrete to create a stop barrier. The screws
should be equally spaced around the PVC pipe and screwed in no more than one-
fourth inch (1/4"). The four inch (4") PVC pipe is to be inserted into the
concrete until the screws rest against the outside of the concrete causing the
end of the PVC pipe to be flush with the interior of the concrete pipe or
structure. The PVC pipe should then be concreted and/or grouted in place with
care taken to prevent the cement materials from entering the pipe or structure.
         (c)   Inspections Required: Trenches and connections are not to be
backfilled until an inspection is made by the appropriate village inspector.
      5.   Connection Not Allowed: Two (2) or more homes are not allowed to

two foot (2') diameter inlet.
      9.   Factory Made Fittings: All connections between house discharge sump
pump discharge and the secondary drainage system shall be made with factory
made fittings. No cut in connections will be allowed.
   (H)   Downspouts: Downspouts for residential usage shall discharge to the
ground surface. They shall not discharge directly to storm sewers or other
underground drains. The discharge location shall be a minimum of five feet (5')
from any property line, five feet (5') from the structure foundation and shall
not be directed toward any neighboring or adjacent building. All efforts shall
be made to direct the runoff water to flow over the property in question as
long as possible, rather than diverting the flow to a neighboring property.
   (I)   Detention Ponds: The village has a storm water management ordinance
(chapter 10 of this title) to diminish threats to public health, safety and
welfare caused by runoff of excessive storm water from new development and
redevelopment.
      1.   Detention Pond Release Rate: Detention shall be provided for all
developments. The post-development runoff shall be limited to 0.15 cfs per
acre. Bulletin 75, or the latest released version of the Illinois State Water
Survey rainfall data, shall be used for storm calculations.
      2.   End Sections: End sections shall be installed at all storm sewer
outfalls into a detention pond. The end section shall be precast concrete. Pipe
twelve inches (12") and larger shall have an integral bell and spigot jointing
system with an O-ring, polyisoprene rubber gasket meeting ASTM F-477. The
gasket shall be factory installed on the spigot end. End sections fifteen
inches (15") or larger in size shall have an IDOT protective grate.
      3.   Concrete Swales: A concrete paved swale or paved ditch is required
in detention ponds where the low flows travel across the pond.
      4.   Turf Improvements: Turf improvements shall include installation of a
minimum of twelve inches (12") of topsoil, fertilizer, and seeding. Final
acceptance of the improvements will be withheld until the turf is established.
Minimum slope of pond bottoms is one percent (1%).
      5.   Landscape Guidelines: Wet bottom and dry bottom detention basins are
two (2) ways to fulfill the requirements of this title. To promote
environmental and ecological benefits of these basins, the village has
established these landscaping guidelines. These guidelines are divided into two
(2) categories: wet bottom ponds and dry bottom basins.
         (a)   Wet Bottom Basins (Fishery):
            (1)   Pond Size: These guidelines are to be used for ponds to
support a fishery. Ponds that support fisheries must be at least one acre in
size and at least twenty five percent (25%) of the pond ten feet (10') to
twelve feet (12') deep, measured from the normal water level. These ponds must
also have storm water best management practices upstream of the pond to reduce
and minimize siltation, high nutrient loads, and other water quality concerns.
            (2)   Wetland Mitigation Projects: Wet bottom basins that are
specifically designed for wetland mitigation or wetland conservation are not
covered in these guidelines. The design for wetland mitigation projects should
follow the U.S. army corps of engineers wetland mitigation guidance documents.
            (3)   Pond Design: The pond shall be designed with respect to its
position in the overall landscape. The following are guidelines that can be
used, but site specific conditions, goals and criteria shall be developed
during the design. The pond design shall be reviewed by the village in
conjunction with the overall site planning.
            (4)   Pond Shape: Several engineering attributes need to be
incorporated into a wet bottom pond design. For landscaping, there are two (2)
important engineering attributes: pond slope and topsoil thickness.
               A.   The pond slope shall be five horizontal to one vertical
(5h:1v) or flatter at the normal pool elevation and no steeper than three
horizontal to one vertical (3h:1v) for other slopes of the pond. Also required
is a level safety ledge at least six feet (6') in width at 2.5 to 3.0 feet
below the normal water depth.
               B.   A minimum of twelve inches (12") of topsoil is required for
areas of the pond that will be vegetated.
            (5)   Vegetation:
               A.   The use of native plants in and around the pond are
required. Only plants native to northeastern Illinois may be used. Genetically
modified plants are not allowed. A list of suitable native plants is presented
in "Native Plant Guide For Streams And Stormwater Facilities In Northeastern
Illinois" by the USDA natural resources conservation service. The developer may
submit additional native plants to the village for approval.
               B.   These guidelines describe four (4) vegetation zones that
need to be included in the pond design: submergent vegetation zone; emergent
vegetation zone; saturated soil zone; and upland slope buffer. A detailed plan,
addressing all four (4) zones, will need to be submitted to the village for
review and approval.
            (6)   Submergent Vegetation Zone: This aquatic plant community is
generally submersed below the water surface or has floating leaves. This plant
community provides important habitat for fish and wildlife, but too much cover
of this plant community can choke a pond and decrease fish habitat. The village
requires random plantings of submergent plants. Thirty percent (30%) of the
safety ledge shall be planted with submergent plants. Areas of gravel on the
safety ledge will help the fish to spawn.
            (7)   Emergent Vegetation Zone: Emergent vegetation grows in
periodic or permanently flooded areas and the plant's leaves and stems extend
above the water's surface. For purposes of this guideline, emergent vegetation
is found in the zone from the normal water's edge to a water depth of six
inches (6"). Survival rate is best when installing live plant parts rather than
seeds, therefore, the village requires the planting of live plant parts for
this zone. Similar plants are recommended to be planted near each other in
small clusters, spacing of one foot (1') to one and one-half feet (11/2') on
center. A minimum of four thousand five hundred (4,500) plugs per acre is
required. Also, a goose grid to keep foraging geese from destroying these
plants is required for the emergent vegetation zone. When choosing the plant
list, the developer shall consider the plant's tolerance of siltation,
salinity, and nutrient load and light preference expected to be found at the
site. The "Native Plant Guide For Streams And Stormwater Facilities In
Northeastern Illinois" provides a good description of the plant's preferences.
            (8)   Saturated Soil Vegetation Zone: Plants that can grow under
saturated soil conditions are included in this zone. This zone, along with the
emergent vegetation zone, is important to stabilizing the shoreline, a common
soil erosion problem area. For purposes of this guideline, saturated soil
vegetation zone extends from the normal water's edge to approximately two feet
(2') above the normal water level or the 2-year flood water level, whichever is
greater. This zone can be seeded, but additional random planting of live plants
is required. A minimum of ten (10) pounds of pure live seed per acre shall be
seeded. The seed mix shall contain a variety of grasses, sedges, rushes and
forbs. A minimum of five (5) grasses, sedges, and rushes and eight (8) forbs
are required. A nurse crop of annual plants shall also be used to help
stabilize the soils and provide conditions suitable for the germination and
growth of perennial plants.
            (9)   Upland Slope Buffer: Plants that can grow in the upland slope
buffer zone occur on well drained slopes or soils and are rarely inundated by
water. Any inundation is also short lived. This zone is on the upland side of
the saturated soil vegetation zone. This zone can be seeded, and a minimum of
ten (10) pounds of pure live seed per acre is required. The seed mix shall
contain a variety of grasses and forbs. A minimum of four (4) grasses and ten
(10) forbs are required. A nurse crop of annual plants shall also be used to
help stabilize the soils and provide conditions suitable for the germination
and growth of perennial plants.
            (10)   Fish Structure: In addition to pond shape and vegetation,
additional habitat features are required to increase fish habitat. To help with
fish spawning, random placement of pea gravel on the safety bench is required.
Each pea gravel spawning area should be approximately twenty five (25) square
feet in size and four inches (4") thick.
      Random placement of rock piles and/or bundles of wood branches shall be
placed at pond depths of eight feet (8') to twelve feet (12'). The Illinois
department of natural resources has guidelines for assembling these types of
fish structures.
      Fishing access along the shoreline is required. The access area should
have a hard bottom, such as ledger stone/flagstone and access areas should be
placed at a minimum of once every two hundred fifty feet (250') of shoreline.
Paths shall be provided to the access areas, and shall be five feet (5') wide
PCC sidewalk.
         (b)   Wet Bottom Basins (Nonfishery):
            (1)   Water tolerant native vegetation or grass shall be used to
landscape the shorelines of wet detention facilities. The selected plants and
planting methods shall conform to the soils, hydrology, and water quality
conditions present in such facilities, with plants being tolerant of highly
variable hydrologic conditions and degraded water quality (e.g., high turbidity
and salinity content). Plant selection should conform to the guidance in the
"Native Plant Guide For Stream And Stormwater Facilities In Northeastern
Illinois" (NRCS et al., 1997), which is hereby adopted by reference.
      Native vegetation is recommended, but not required, for side slopes of
all detention facilities.
         (c)   Dry Bottom Detention Basins:
            (1)   There are two (2) basic land uses for dry bottom basins:
active management for multipurpose activities or passive use for aesthetics and
wildlife. A dry bottom basin that will accommodate athletic fields and
playgrounds shall have an underdrain system to keep the fields dry. This area
is suitable for turf grasses that can be mowed regularly. A mixture of at least
three (3) turf grasses is required. Common turf grasses include Kentucky
bluegrass, perennial rye grass, creeping red fescue, tall fescue, redtop, and
timothy. The first four (4) species are best for higher traffic areas. Traffic
tolerant cultivars are required.
            (2)   Dry bottom basins, intended to be used for aesthetics and
wildlife shall have native plantings. Deep rooted plants are required to
encourage infiltration of the water into the ground. A mixture of wet mesic and
mesic plants shall be used within the dry bottom basin. This zone can be
seeded, and a minimum of ten (10) pounds of pure live seed per acre is
required. The seed mix shall contain a variety of grasses, sedges, rushes and
forbs. A minimum of five (5) grasses, sedges, and rushes and ten (10) forbs are
required. A nurse crop of annual plants shall also be used to help stabilize
the soils and provide conditions suitable for the germination and growth of
perennial plants.
   (J)   Miscellaneous Standards:
      1.   General:
         (a)   All the required correction of defects of the storm sewer shall
be performed before curb and gutter or other permanent type surface improvement
work begins.
         (b)   Any piping defects including cracks, improperly sealed joints,
or variations from approved grade, slope, or alignment shall be repaired at the
contractor's expense by means approved by the village engineer.
         (c)   Any pipes or structures containing sediment shall be cleaned
prior to acceptance.

10-8-18: EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN:
A soil and erosion plan shall be provided in accordance with the provisions in
this chapter.
   (A)   General:
      1.   All residential, commercial, or industrial subdivision of
development including single lots shall include provisions for the installation
and regular maintenance of soil erosion and sedimentation control devices.
      2.   The erosion control system shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the latest edition of the following: "Illinois Urban Manual";
the IDOT "Standard Specifications"; the Illinois environmental protection
agency "Standards And Specifications For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control".
   (B)   Basic Design Standards:
      1.   On site sediment control measures, as specified by the following
criteria, shall be constructed and functional prior to initiating clearing,
grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site.
         (a)   For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers
(including filter fences, ditch checks, or equivalent control measures) shall
be constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in reference
handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet
(25'), may be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
         (b)   For disturbed areas draining more than one acre, a sediment trap
or equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of
the disturbed area.
         (c)   Sediment basins and sediment traps designs shall provide for
both detention storage and sediment storage. The detention storage shall be
composed of equal volumes of "wet" detention storage and "dry" detention
storage and each shall be sized for the two (2) year, twenty four (24) hour
runoff from the site under maximum runoff conditions during construction. The
release rate of the basin shall be that rate required to achieve minimum
detention times of at least ten (10) hours. The elevation of the outlet
structure shall be placed such that it only drains the dry detention storage.
         (d)   The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated
sediment load generated from the site over the duration of the construction
period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume of sediment generated in
one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the one year sediment
load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted.
         (e)   The developer and contractors shall use a water wagon or other
acceptable means on the project site to control dust, at a minimum of once each
day during dry conditions or more frequently as directed by the village
engineer.
         (f)   All streets used by the developer, contractors, or suppliers in
or adjacent to the development shall be kept free of debris, dirt, dust, and
mud. Streets shall be left in a clean condition at the end of each day's work.
Developers and contractors who fail to keep streets clean shall be responsible
for street cleaning expenses incurred by the village.
      2.   Storm water conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and
diversions, and the outlets of all channels and pipes shall be designed and
constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from the 10-year frequency
storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be stabilized
within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards:
         (a)   For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with
mulch, erosion blanket, or an equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod
or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the bottom of the channel.
         (b)   For grades of four percent (4%) to eight percent (8%), sod or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied in the channel.
         (c)   For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap, or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied, or the grade shall be effectively
reduced using drop structures.
         (d)   All drainage ditches and overland flood routes shall be seeded
and lined with silt fence prior to acceptance by the village.
      3.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent
measures within three (3) calendar days following the end of active
disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall
include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
         (b)   Areas having slopes greater than twelve percent (12%) shall be
stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or equivalent.
      4.   Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided,
where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
         (a)   Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to
the maximum extent practicable. Where construction crossings are necessary,
temporary crossings shall be constructed on nonerosive material, such as riprap
or gravel.
         (b)   The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be
kept to a minimum. The stream channel, including bed and banks, shall be
restabilized within forty eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is
completed, interrupted, or stopped.
         (c)   Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall
be constructed in the dry and fully stabilized before flow is diverted.
      5.   Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by ditch checks,
sediment traps or filter barriers meeting accepted design standards and
specifications. Ditch checks and silt fences shall be inspected weekly and
after rainfall events in excess of one- half inch (1/2") to determine required
repairs and/or replacement. As a minimum, ditch checks are to be replaced every
three (3) months or as required by the village engineer. If tributary drainage
areas are greater than one acre, sediment basins shall be constructed in
addition to using ditch checks and silt fences. Installation of silt fence or
filter fabric under the lid of a structure is not considered adequate
protection and is not allowed.
      6.   Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of
material shall not be located with a downslope drainage length of less than
twenty five feet (25') to a roadway, easement, or drainage channel. Filter
barriers, including ditch checks, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be
installed immediately on the downslope side of the piles.
      7.   If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be
protected from erosion. All pumped discharges shall be routed through
appropriately designed sediment traps or basins or equivalent.
      8.   All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices
must be maintained and repaired as needed to assure effective performance of
their intended function.
      9.   All temporary erosion and sediment control measurers shall be
disposed of within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved
with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
      10.   The condition of the construction site for the winter shutdown
period shall address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall
growing season so that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with
temporary and/or permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain
idle throughout the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measure
including temporary seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior
to the end of the fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of
the growing season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not
rely on vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching.
      11.   All waste generated as a result of site development activity should
be properly disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site
by either wind or water.

maintained periodically by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the
period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory manner
to ensure adequate performance. The developer will identify and provide to the
village the name of the person(s) or entity which will have legal
responsibility for maintenance of erosion control structures and measures after
development is completed.
      2.   Inspection: A village representative shall make inspections as
hereinafter required and shall either approve that portion of the work
completed or shall notify the permittee wherein the work fails to comply with
the site development or erosion and sedimentation control plan as approved.
Plans for grading, stripping, excavating, and filling work bearing the stamp of
approval of the village field inspector or his representative shall be
maintained at the site during progress of the work. In order to obtain
inspections and to ensure compliance with the approved erosion and sediment
control plan, the grading or building permit, and this title, the permittee
shall notify the village field inspector within two (2) working days of the
completion of the construction stages specified below:
         (a)   Upon completion of installation of sediment and runoff control
measures (including perimeter controls and diversions), prior to proceeding

storm sewers, gutters, etc., will be inspected by the village to determine any
cleaning or flushing of trapped sediment which may be required due to erosion.
The responsibility for that work lies with the site developer.
      5.   Special Precautions:
         (a)   If at any stage of the grading of any development site, the
village engineer or his designee determines by inspection that the nature of
the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely
to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage
structure, the village engineer or the village field inspector may require, as
a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special
precautions to be taken as considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such
peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to: a more
level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berming,
terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion
control, and recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering
geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
         (b)   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the
grading on any development site is not complete, work may be stopped and the
permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures
as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large
developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village may specify
the time of starting grading and time of completion or may require that the
operations be conducted in specific stages so as to ensure completion of
protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement, was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement

   (M)   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   (N)   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 18-21, 1-22-2019)
10-9-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the Director of Building and Zoning. The Director of
Building and Zoning shall not issue a development permit if the proposed
development does not meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (A)   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood
source, but not identified as floodplain on the current Flood Insurance Rate
Map, is subject to the provisions of this chapter. Any development located on
land that can be shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood
elevation and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first
Flood Insurance Rate Map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to
the provisions of this chapter.
The Director of Building and Zoning shall maintain documentation of the
existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood Insurance
Rate Map identification.
The Director of Building and Zoning shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other Federal, State, and local permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
Director of Building and Zoning shall not issue a permit unless all other
Federal, State, and local permits have been obtained. (Ord. 18-21, 1-22-2019)

      7.   All other State and Federal permits have been obtained.
   (B)   Notification: The Village Board shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of
section
10-9-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property; and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   (C)   Historic Structures:
      1.   Variances to the building protection requirements of section
10-9-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
10-9-6 and
10-9-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
         (a)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         (b)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure
being removed as a certified historic structure.
   (D)   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter. In order to
minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to public
health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any variance
issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at-grade and wet-
floodproofed.
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in Zone A only as identified on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood-resistant materials in accordance with
section
10-9-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
10-9-7 of this chapter. All the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section

10-9-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur, or flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the Village of Manteno or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 18-21, 1-22-2019)
10-9-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the Director of Building and
Zoning may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter
exists. The Director of Building and Zoning shall notify the owner in writing
of such violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The Village of Manteno shall make application to the Circuit Court
for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other
order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues.
      4.   The Village of Manteno shall record a notice of violation on the
title of the property.
   (B)   The Director of Building and Zoning shall inform the owner that any
such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
   The Director of Building and Zoning is authorized to issue an order
requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall
be in writing, indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the
action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work
order. The stop-work order constitutes a suspension of the permit. No site
development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is
held by the Village Board. Written notice of such hearing shall be served on
the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Village Board shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village of Manteno from taking such
other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 18-21, 1-22-
2019)
10-9-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the Village of
Manteno to fulfill the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program
including all other floodplain related ordinances. However, this chapter does
not repeal the original resolution or ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility
in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this chapter and other
ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 18-21,
1-22-2019)
10-9-15: SEVERABILITY:
The provisions and sections of this chapter shall be deemed separable and the
invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity of the
remainder. (Ord. 18-21, 1-22-2019)
10-9-16: EFFECTIVE DATE:
This chapter shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage,

10-10-3: STORM WATER RUNOFF MANAGEMENT:
   (A)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff shall
be required in combination for all commercial, industrial, institutional,
governmental, utility, or other developments and for residential developments
that contain an area in excess of two (2) acres.
   (B)   The controlled release and storage of excess storm water runoff from
all developments described above, shall not exceed the existing safe storm
drainage capacity of the natural downstream outlet channel or storm sewer
system, or that amount of existing runoff from the parcel of land in a
vegetative condition, whichever is less. The final release rate shall not
exceed the existing rate for all recurrence storm events up to and including
the 100-year storm event. The rate at which storm water runoff is delivered to
an existing village owned designated storm water storage area may be
unrestricted, but subject to prior village approval and agreement with the
village to purchase the required storage.
      1.   Release rates for new developments or redevelopments or
redevelopments shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the
total property under development for the 100-year critical duration storm
event. The allowable release rate for the 100-year critical duration storm
event is:
 
Event Frequency Maximum Release Rate (cfs/Acre)
100-year        0.15 (minus the area directly released from the site)
 
   If it is determined by the village that the safe downstream capacity of the
natural downstream (receiving) outlet channel or storm sewer storm drainage
system may not safely convey the allowable release rate(s), the release rate(s)
shall be lowered such that the receiving system can safely handle the detention
pond discharge. The applicant may be required to provide documentation that
downstream capacity is adequate and erosion prevention measures will be
installed.
      2.   ISWS Bulletin 75, or the latest released version of the Illinois
State Water Survey rainfall data distributions, shall be used for all design
rainfall events.
   (C)   A storm sewer conveyance system shall be designed with adequate
capacity to convey through the development the storm water runoff from all
tributary upstream areas. Design of the system shall also take into
consideration control of storm water velocity (minimum storm sewer design
velocity = 2 fps) to prevent erosion or other damage to the facility, which
will restrict its primary use. Construction of a low flow system of storm
sewers to carry the minor storm runoff and reshaping of the channel with a
minimum of five (5) horizontal to one vertical side slopes (5:1) and bottom of
a width adequate to facilitate maintenance and carry the flood runoff without
eroding velocities may be required in the plans for land development.
      1.   A channel system shall be designed with adequate capacity to convey
through the development the storm water runoff from all tributary upstream
areas. This channel shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a
100-year critical duration storm as published by the recognized agency,
assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas are fully
developed and have been saturated with antecedent rainfall (AMC = 4).
         (a)   No habitable structures shall be constructed within this
channel; however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements
shall be considered compatible uses.
         (b)   In the event that conveyance of the channel is reduced by
restrictions for reshaping, construction, or any other activity the village may
cause to have any restrictions removed at the expense of the party or parties
causing said restriction.
         (c)   Design of this channel system shall also take into consideration
control of storm water velocity to prevent erosion or other damage to the
facility which will restrict its primary use. Depths of flow shall be kept to a
minimum and retention of channel configurations shall be totally under village
control. In the event that the area within this channel is reshaped or
restricted for use as a floodway, the village may cause to have any
restrictions removed at the expense of the party or parties causing said
restriction. Should the development contain an existing natural waterway, this
land configuration shall be preserved as part of the channel system.
         (d)   The lowest opening of all habitable structures shall have one
foot (1') of freeboard during the 100-year critical duration flood event.
      2.   Construction of a low flow system of storm sewers to carry the peak
rate of discharge from a 10-year storm of critical duration as published by the
recognized agency may be required in the plans for land development. All storm
sewer systems shall be designed using the Manning's "n" value of 0.013 and have
a minimum design velocity of two (2) fps.
      3.   Should the development contain a natural waterway, depressional
area, lake, pond, or wetland, this land configuration should be preserved. If
the configuration must be altered, the lost value must be mitigated.
         (a)   If channel modification occurs, the physical characteristics of
the modified channel shall meet the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope, sinuosity, and carrying capacity of the original channel. Hydraulically
equivalent compensatory storage is required for fill or structures and shall be
at least equal to the volume of floodplain lost. Channel modification must not
result in adverse flooding impact to adjacent property owners.
         (b)   All disturbed areas associated with a channel modification shall
be seeded or otherwise stabilized immediately upon completion of site grading
construction.
         (c)   If the upstream drainage area exceeds one square mile, the
Illinois department of transportation division of water resources must be
notified and all relevant permits received before modification of the waterway
begins.
         (d)   Compensatory storage is required for fill or structures placed
in depressional areas, lakes, and ponds and shall be at least equal to the
volume of open water and flood storage lost.
         (e)   Filling of wetland areas will be avoided. If a wetland area is
to be filled, compensatory storage at least equal to the volume of flood
storage lost must be provided. Mitigation of the functional value of the
wetland may be required. A permit must be received from the U.S. army corps of
engineers before filling of any wetland area.
         (f)   The extent of any wetland must be delineated according to the
current federal wetland determination methodology.
      4.   The applicant shall submit a subsurface drainage inventory. The
inventory shall locate existing farm and storm drainage tiles by appropriate
methods performed by a qualified individual. All existing drain tile lines
damaged during the investigation shall be repaired in a method approved on site
by the village engineer.
         (a)   The applicant shall provide a topographical map of the
development site. The name, address, and phone number of the person or firm
conducting tile location investigation shall be included on this map. The
inventory shall include:
            (1)   Proof of notification to adjacent landowners.
            (2)   Aerial photographs.
            (3)   Proof of notification with any active drainage districts.
            (4)   Consultation with NRCS/SWCD.
            (5)   Other items as required by the village.
         (b)   Information collected during the drainage investigation shall be
used to design and develop a storm water management system that is appropriate
for the development and connecting of tile lines on adjoining properties.
         (c)   Existing easements for any agricultural drainage systems located
underneath areas that will be developed shall be preserved. If no such easement
exists, an easement shall be dedicated to access, maintain, operate and repair
or replace the system.
         (d)   All agricultural drainage systems that serve upstream areas
outside of the development and that are located underneath areas that will be
developed shall be replaced with nonperforated storm sewer pipes or otherwise
protected to prevent root blockage. The existing drainage district system may
remain in place with the approval of the drainage district and the village.
         (e)   Agricultural drainage systems that, due to development, will be
located underneath streets, driveways, and other paved areas as allowed by this
chapter, shall be replaced with reinforced concrete storm sewer pipes.
         (f)   Agricultural drainage systems shall be relocated within the
development area when required by the village engineer or the village field
inspector. Such relocation shall maintain sufficient slope and capacity to
prevent sedimentation and to prevent an increase in scouring or structural
damage to the conduit. However, the relocated system shall not be required to
exceed the existing slope or capacity of the existing tile. If the system is
not under the authority of a drainage district, the village shall consider the
interests of those landowners who are served by the system when drainage
systems are relocated.
         (g)   Field tile systems disturbed during the process of development
shall be reconnected by those responsible for their disturbance unless
otherwise approved by the village engineer.
         (h)   Connection of agricultural tiles to storm water systems shall be
discouraged. Where tiles are being connected to these storm water systems or at
points of ingress or egress from the development sites, observation structures
or similar maintenance and inspection access structures shall be installed.
         (i)   Surface outflows onto adjoining properties not into a defined
channel shall be designed to release as sheet flow using level spreader
trenches or alternative designs as approved by the village engineer.
   (D)   The required volume to be provided in the storm water detention basin
shall be calculated based on the need to restrict the runoff from a 100-year
frequency rainfall for the critical duration event (peak discharge) as
published by the recognized agency. The allowable release rates shall be
maintained while providing a minimum of one vertical foot of freeboard for the
100-year event. The volume for storm water storage areas shall be calculated
using a hydrograph producing runoff calculation method, including HEC-HMS, HEC-
1, TR20, and Pond Pack. This volume of storage shall be provided for the fully
developed watershed that is tributary to the area designed for detention
purposes. The storm water release rate (0.15 cfs per acre during the 100-year
event) shall be considered when calculating the storm water storage capacity
and the control structure designed to maintain a relatively uniform flow rate
regardless of the depth of storm water in the storage area. The modified
rational formula may be acceptable for sites less than five (5) acres, subject
to approval by the village engineer.
      1.   General design requirements for storm water detention basins shall
include:
         (a)   Temporary and permanent erosion control shall be required for
all detention basins in accordance with this title.
         (b)   Erosion protection shall be inspected by the owner or the
owner's representative throughout the project duration.
         (c)   To effectively reduce runoff volumes, the use of infiltration
practices including basins, trenches, and permeable pavement are encouraged.
The "Illinois Urban Manual" contains criteria for the design and use of these
practices. An appropriate sediment control device shall be provided to remove
coarse sediment from storm water flows before they reach infiltration basins or
trenches. Engineering calculations demonstrating infiltration rates shall be
included with the application.
         (d)   Detention basin side slopes above normal pool shall be designed
with permanent erosion protection consisting of suitable vegetation or other
permanent finish. Topsoil must be provided per specific basin type design
criteria. Permanent erosion protection shall be aesthetically suitable to the
development or existing surrounding land use.
         (e)   All storm water detention basins shall be provided with an
overflow structure capable of safely passing flows in excess of 100-year event
at a stage not exceeding one foot (1') above high water level. The top of the
lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the detention basin shall be two
feet (2') above high water level. The design flow rate of the overflow
structure shall be equivalent to the 100-year peak inflow rate. A professional
engineer registered in the state of Illinois shall design weirs, dams and
specialized outflows.
         (f)   Detention basin outlets shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete pipe(s) with a minimum inside diameter of twelve inches (12"). Further
restriction to flow may be provided by a restrictor plate placed upstream of
the outlet. This may be achieved by constructing a concrete wall with a
"restrictor manhole". The orifice opening in the restrictor plate shall have a
minimum diameter of four inches (4"). More specialized designs shall be
required when release rates require restriction that cannot be achieved by the
minimum allowed four inch (4") diameter orifice opening. The more specialized
design shall include provisions to minimize clogging and that tend to self-
clean the restriction. Use of a slotted riser pipe may be considered as a last
resort, and if approved by the village engineer. However, the riser pipe must
be protected from damage due to mowing, weather, and other possible impacts.
         (g)   End sections shall be installed at all storm sewer outfalls into
a detention pond. The end section shall be precast concrete. Pipe twelve inches
(12") and larger shall have an integral bell and spigot jointing system with an
O-ring, polyisoprene rubber gasket meeting ASTM F-477. The gasket shall be
factory installed on the spigot end. End sections fifteen inches (15") or
larger in size shall have an IDOT protective grate.
         (h)   Bubble up outlets, pumped outlets and other active control
structures are prohibited.
         (i)   Temporary erosion techniques shall be used as required to ensure
a full stand of cover vegetation in minimum time.
         (j)   Detention basins and their 100-year design high water elevation
shall be contained within platted lots or easements dedicated for drainage
purposes.
         (k)   Detention basin lots shall have adequate access for maintenance
purposes as approved by the village engineer.
         (l)   Parking lot detention is intended for redevelopment areas and
shall be allowed only where approved by the village engineer. Parking lot
detention, when approved shall be in the aisleways not within the parking
stalls.
         (m)   Storm water runoff from area tributaries to the property shall
be considered in the design of the property's drainage system. Flows from
upstream areas that are not to be detained should be routed around the basin
being provided for the site being developed.
         (n)   Where storm water detention or retention basins are to be used
as part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the
first element of the initial earthwork program unless otherwise agreed to by
the village engineer. The applicant on a regular basis and before project
completion shall remove any eroded sediment captured in these facilities in
order to maintain the design volume of the facilities.
         (o)   All storm water detention or retention basin construction shall
examine potential impacts to adjacent agricultural land and shall address
measures that will be implemented to eliminate such impacts and comply with
other relevant permitting.
         (p)   Existing wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds shall not be modified
for the purposes of storm water detention unless it is demonstrated that the
proposed modifications will maintain or improve their habitat and ability to
perform beneficial functions and shall comply with other relevant permitting.
Existing storage and release rate characteristics of wetlands, rivers, lakes,
ponds, or other depressional storage areas shall be maintained and the volume
of detention storage provided to meet the requirements of this section shall be
in addition to this existing storage.
         (q)   Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially
decrease or increase the existing area tributary to wetlands, rivers, lakes or
ponds. Drainage patterns shall not be altered by development to direct runoff
off site to other than natural drainage outlets existing prior to development.
      2.   Verification and final approval requirements for storm water
detention basins shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Erosion protection shall be inspected by the owner or the
owner's representative throughout the project duration.
         (b)   Detention basin storage volume shall be verified to the
satisfaction of the village engineer through as built surveys or other means
approved by the village engineer in advance.
         (c)   Inflow, outflow and emergency overflow elevations and
configurations shall be verified through as built surveys.
         (d)   Final vegetative cover and permanent erosion control shall be
inspected for completeness of cover.
         (e)   The basin will receive final approval upon fulfillment of
subsections (D)2(b), (D)2(c), and (D)2(d) of this section, and any and all
other requirements or agreements with the jurisdiction. The anniversary date of
maintenance and repair reporting will be recorded as such.
         (f)   All basins must receive final approval within ninety (90) days
of the substantial completion as determined by the village engineer of any of
the following:
            (1)   The first phase (as shown on approved plans) of construction
of public utilities and roadways in any approved subdivision project. Detention
structures for the ultimate development area must be constructed during the
first phase of the project, and approved at its completion unless otherwise
agreed to by the village. The detention structures must then be maintained and
repaired in conformance with this chapter, during future construction phases.
            (2)   Parking areas, floor slabs and/or other impervious areas (as
shown on approved plans, and not including sidewalks) for work on an individual
lot requiring an individual permit under this chapter. Phased construction will
be treated as in the above case.
            (3)   Mass earthwork or rough grading, if no other phased
construction is scheduled to be started within one hundred eighty (180) days.
      3.   Maintenance and repair responsibilities for storm water detention
basins shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Detention basins and associated inflow and outflow systems are
maintained by the property owner absent any specific legal agreement to the
contrary.
         (b)   Maintenance agreements may be required at the option of the
village administrator or village engineer to define parties responsible for the
maintenance of detention basins.
         (c)   The detention basin owner shall be responsible for the following
items:
            (1)   An annual report on the detention basin condition shall be
submitted to the village engineer.
            (2)   At five (5) year intervals, the basin shall be inspected by a
professional engineer registered in the state of Illinois. A report of this
inspection shall be submitted to the village engineer within sixty (60) days of
the inspection. An annual report is not required the year the five (5) year
report is due.
            (3)   Detention basin owners shall notify subsequent owners of
their maintenance responsibilities and transfer basin maintenance records to
the party with active maintenance responsibility.
            (4)   These requirements shall be effective only for facilities
constructed after the passage of this title.
         (d)   Failure to receive final approval as required will be considered
a violation of this chapter.
         (e)   Final approval of the basin shall not constitute acceptance by
the village for dedication nor completion of this chapter's maintenance
requirements.
   (E)   Dry bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed to serve a
secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will
not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding.
      1.   A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be
provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a
positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or storm sewer with adequate
capacity as described below.
      2.   The combination of storage of the water from a 100-year critical
duration storm and the design release rate shall not result in a storage
duration in excess of seventy two (72) hours.
      3.   The maximum depth of planned storm water storage shall not exceed
four feet (4') unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions
lend to greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the village engineer.
      4.   Minimum grades for turf areas shall be one percent (1%) and maximum
slopes shall be ten percent (10%) (10 units horizontally to 1 unit vertically).
Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as
practical and a twenty percent (20%) slope (5 units horizontally to 1 unit
vertically) or less shall be used wherever possible. If slopes greater than
twenty percent (20%) are necessary to meet storage requirements or area
restrictions, written approval shall be obtained from the village engineer and
suitable erosion control provided in addition to the protection required to
ensure public health, safety and welfare.
      5.   Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible
and shall require little or no attention for proper operation.
      6.   Each storm water detention basin shall be provided with a method of
emergency overflow, overflow weir, in the event that a storm in excess of the
100-year frequency storm occurs. This overflow weir shall be designed to
function without attention and shall become part of the natural or surface
channel system described below. The top of bank for the storm water detention
area shall be one foot (1') higher than the water elevation going over the
overflow weir. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all
design features.
      7.   Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow weirs shall be
designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety and
welfare. Storm water runoff velocities shall be kept at a minimum and turbulent
conditions at an outfall control structure will not be permitted without
complete protection for the public safety. The use of restrictive fences shall
be kept to a minimum and used only as a last resort when no other method is
feasible.
      8.   Appropriate soil conditions shall be provided in the basin. First,
compaction of both subsoil and topsoil shall be minimized (i.e., to less than
275 psi). Where subsoil compaction cannot be avoided, it should be worked to a
depth of six (6) to eight inches (8") before spreading topsoil. Second,
suitable uncompacted topsoil, at a minimum thickness of one foot (1') shall be
spread to provide a suitable growing medium for plants. Coarse soils with
minimal clay content and a high organic content are required.
      9.   Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin
designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize resuspension
of pollutants.
      10.   The distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the basin providing
that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on topography or
other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use baffles or berms in
the basin bottom to prevent short circuiting of low flows.
      11.   A sediment trap shall be constructed at each major inlet to a dry
basin during construction. The temporary sediment trap shall be designed in
accordance with criteria in the "Illinois Urban Manual".
      12.   Dry bottom basins, intended to be used for aesthetics and wildlife
shall have native plantings. This type of dry bottom basin shall be used only
if approved by the village. Deep rooted plants are required to encourage
infiltration of the water into the ground. A mixture of wet mesic and mesic
plants shall be used within the dry bottom basin. This zone can be seeded, and
a minimum of ten (10) pounds of pure live seed per acre is required. The seed
mix shall contain a variety of grasses, sedges, rushes and forbs. A minimum of
five (5) grasses, sedges, rushes and forbs are required. A nurse crop of annual
plants shall also be used to help stabilize the soils and provide conditions
suitable for the germination and growth of perennial plants.
   (F)   Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed with all of the
items required for dry bottom storm water storage areas, except that a low flow
conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity outlet shall be
eliminated. However, the following additional conditions shall be complied
with:
      1.   Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave
action.
      2.   Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet (4'), excluding near
shore zones and safety ledges.
      3.   If a fish habitat is to be provided, the basin depth shall be at
least ten (10) to twelve feet (12') deep over twenty five percent (25%) of the
bottom area to prevent winterkill. These ponds must also have storm water best
management practices upstream of the pond to reduce and minimize siltation,
high nutrient loads, and other water quality concerns.
In addition to pond shape and vegetation, additional habitat features are
required to increase fish habitat. To help with fish spawning, random placement
of pea gravel on the safety bench is required. Each pea gravel spawning area
shall be approximately twenty five (25) square feet in size and four inches
(4") thick.
Random placement of rock piles and/or bundles of wood branches shall be placed
at pond depths of eight feet (8') to twelve feet (12'). The Illinois department
of natural resources has guidelines for assembling these types of fish
structures.
Fishing access along the shoreline is required. The access area shall have a
hard bottom, such as ledger stone/flagstone and access areas shall be placed at
a minimum of once every two hundred fifty feet (250') of shoreline. Paths shall
be provided to the access areas, and shall be five feet (5') wide PCC sidewalk.
      4.   Facilities shall be available to allow the pond level to be lowered
by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance and public
safety. If a positive gravity outlet is not provided by the developer, the
developer may be required to provide a pumping system to be approved by the
village for the above purpose.
      5.   Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to
operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level.
Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features.
      6.   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided.
Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration
facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the
perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to
the satisfaction of the village.
      7.   In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for
purposes of storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the
evapotranspiration demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of
excess storm water runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the 100-year
storm runoff.
      8.   Wet bottom detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water
pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible
to be available for recreational use.
      9.   Side slopes from the top of bank to at least one foot (1') below the
safety ledge shall be no steeper than five to one (5:1) and three to one (3:1)
from one foot (1') below the safety ledge to a depth of eight feet (8'). Slopes
below a depth of eight feet (8') are permitted to be two to one (2:1).
         (a)   Appropriate soil conditions shall be provided in the shoreline
zone. First, compaction of both subsoil and topsoil shall be minimized (i.e.,
to less than 275 psi). Where subsoil compaction cannot be avoided, it should be
disked to a depth of six (6) to eight inches (8") with a chisel plow before
spreading topsoil. Second, suitable uncompacted topsoil, at a minimum thickness
of one foot (1') shall be spread to provide a suitable growing medium for
aquatic plants. Coarse soils with minimal clay content and a high organic
content are recommended.
      10.   All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge.
      11.   The minimum permanent pool volume in a wet bottom basin at normal
depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two (2)
year, twenty four (24) hour event.
      12.   The distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized. Inlets and outlets shall be at opposite ends of the basin providing
that the orientation does not create undue hardship based on topography or
other natural constraints. Designers are encouraged to use baffles or berms in
the basin bottom to prevent short circuiting of low flows.
      13.   Water tolerant native vegetation or grass shall be used to
landscape the shorelines of wet detention facilities. The selected plants and
planting methods shall conform to the soils, hydrology, and water quality
conditions present in such facilities, with plants being tolerant of highly
variable hydrologic conditions and degraded water quality (e.g., high turbidity
and salinity content). Plant selection should conform to the guidance in the
"Native Plant Guide For Stream And Stormwater Facilities In Northeastern
Illinois" (NRCS et al, 1997), which is hereby adopted by reference.
Native vegetation is recommended, but not required, for side slopes of all
detention facilities.
      14.   Wet bottom basin design shall include an evaluation of soil
permeability. A basin liner shall be included in the design if needed to ensure
water retention to normal pool elevation.
   (G)   On stream detention basins are discouraged but will be considered if
they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of
this title with respect to water quality and control of the 100-year, critical
duration storm events from the property.
      1.   If on stream detention is used in watersheds larger than two hundred
(200) acres, the applicant will use hydrologic and hydraulic modeling to
demonstrate that the design will not increase the flood levels for any
properties upstream or downstream of the property.
      2.   Impoundment of the stream as part of on stream detention shall:
         (a)   Require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source
management program utilizing best management practices for runoff and sediment
reduction. This program is necessary to prevent direct discharge to the stream.
         (b)   Require the implementation of best management practices (BMPs)
for runoff reduction consistent with the hierarchy for minimization of runoff
volumes and rates as defined in this title.
         (c)   Require two (2) year, twenty four (24) hour detention/
sedimentation basins for all development consistent with the criteria of
temporary sediment trap in the "Illinois Urban Manual".
         (d)   Require a program to control nonpoint sources at the source for
prior developments constructed without appropriate storm water BMPs.
         (e)   Include a design for appropriate bank stabilization measures,
based on flow velocity calculations, and a presedimentation basin.
         (f)   Comply with other relevant permitting and/or ordinances.
      3.   Impoundment of the stream as part of on stream detention shall not:
         (a)   Prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require
access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning.
         (b)   Cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or
stream aquatic habitat.
         (c)   Involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands.
         (d)   Increase base flood elevations or high water levels of any
adjacent land.
   (H)   Fee in lieu of detention may be considered by the village for the
purpose of satisfying the requirements for storm water detention or
compensatory storage. For a development or redevelopment on a property for
which detention or compensatory storage was not previously provided, a fee in
lieu of detention or compensatory storage may be assessed against the
development prior to the issuance of a permit. Fees shall be calculated to
establish the property's fair share of costs to provide detention or
compensatory storage for the watershed or drainage basin in which the property
exists. The cost figures used for detention shall be actual costs for detention
or compensatory storage being provided by contract or estimated costs for
planned detention or compensatory storage facilities approved by the
appropriate jurisdiction official. All revenues received through such fees
shall be used for no purpose other than defraying public costs associated with
providing regional detention or compensatory storage facilities.
   (I)   Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage areas shall
have minimum grades of one-half percent (1/2%) and shall be restricted to
storage depths of one foot (1') maximum. Rooftop storage shall be designed with
permanent type control inlets and parapet walls to contain runoff on the
rooftop. Emergency overflow areas shall be provided to ensure that the weight
of water stored will not exceed the structural capacity of the roof. Release
rates and storage volume requirements for paved storage areas remain the same
as outlined above. If a portion of an area within a storm water storage area is
to be paved for parking or recreation purposes, the paved surface shall be
placed at the highest elevation within the storage areas as possible. Maximum
parking lot grades shall not exceed normal design parameters of three (3) to
five percent (5%).
   (J)   Where developments form only a portion of a watershed or contain
portions of several watersheds, the requirement for providing storage shall be
based upon the proportion of the area being developed as compared to the total
watershed tributary to the storage area. Compensating storage will be
acceptable only when approved by the village. As a watershed is developed with
a series of storm water storage facilities, due consideration will be given for
calculation of the allowable release rate and capacity of the natural or
surface channel system described above.
   (K)   Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm water runoff
control as required hereunder shall be submitted to the village for review and
approval prior to the approval of a final plat, in the case of subdivisions,
mobile home parks and planned unit developments, or issuance of a building
permit, in the case of commercial or industrial construction.
   (L)   Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or
damage by flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm water
runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earthmoving or drainage
construction on the project site.
   (M)   The construction of the storm water control system shall be
accomplished as part of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage
capacity can be increased to provide benefits to the village, negotiations for
public participation in the cost of development may be feasible.
   (N)   The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity
of the area being developed is encouraged. Design of the storm water runoff
shall give consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for
the reduction in the percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved
and roofed over. Specific design calculations and details shall be provided
with the final plans and specifications presented for village review. The use
of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions of storm runoff storage area,
the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of existing topography are
examples of possible recharge methods.
   (O)   During the construction phases of land development, facilities shall
be provided to prevent the erosion and washing away of the earth. Silting of
downstream areas can be prevented through the strategic use of stilling basins,
sodding of runoff channels, and by limiting the period of time during which the
earth is stripped of vegetation.
   (P)   Final engineering plans shall show complete details for all of the
items covered in this chapter and shall be submitted for review and approved by
the village board prior to the start of construction. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007;
amd. Ord. 20-24, 2-1-2021)

Soil Erosion And Sediment Control", adopted October 1987, are hereby
incorporated into this chapter and made a part hereof by this reference, for
purposes of exemplifying the considerations and factors which should enter into
the preparation of a site development plan. All mandatory requirements of the
above listed standards shall be met. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-4-3: BUILDING PERMIT:
No building permit shall be issued for an intended building unless the proposed
drainage, earthwork and other improvements are in conformance with the site
development plan approved previously or as a part of the application for
building permit. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-4-4: APPEALS:
The applicant, as well as any person aggrieved, may appeal the decision of the
building inspector. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an appeal, the
plan commission shall schedule and hold a public hearing. The plan commission
shall render a decision within fifteen (15) days of the hearing. Factors to be
considered on review shall include, but not be limited to, possible saturation
of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic, runoff
surface waters that produce erosion, and silting of drainageways; nature and
type of soil or rock that when disturbed by the proposed grading may create
earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be landscaped, and excessive and
unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape through grading or removal of
vegetation. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-4-5: RESPONSIBILITY:
Failure of the village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend denial of the site development permit, or of the
plan commission to deny said permit, shall not relieve the permittee from
responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall not
result in the village, its officers or agents being responsible for any
condition or damage resulting therefrom. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-4-6: RETENTION OF PLANS:
Plans, specifications and reports for all site developments shall be retained
in original form or on microfilm by the building inspector. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-
2007)
10-10-4-7: INSPECTIONS:
The director of building and zoning shall make inspections as hereinafter
required and shall either approve that portion of the work completed or shall
notify the permittee wherein the same fails to comply with the site development
plan. Where it is found by inspection that conditions are not substantially as
stated or shown in the said plan, the director of building and zoning may stop
further work until approval is obtained for a revised grading plan conforming
to the existing conditions. Plans for grading work, bearing the stamp of
approval of the director of building and zoning, shall be maintained at the
site during progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, a sign
issued by the village, indicating permission to grade has been granted by the
village, shall be prominently displayed on the front property line of the
property involved so as to be visible from the street on which the property
fronts. In order to obtain inspections in accordance with the following
schedule, the permittee shall notify the director of building and zoning at
least two (2) full working days before the said inspection is to be made.
   (A)   Rough Grading: When all rough grading has been completed; and
   (B)   Final Inspection: When all work, including installation, or all
drainage and other structures and required planting, has been completed. (Ord.
07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-4-8: RECORD DRAWINGS:
Upon completion of the improvements, the engineer shall provide a set of as
built plans to the building inspector along with a certification that the
completed improvements generally conform to the previously approved plans,
specifications and reports included in section
10-10-4-6 of this chapter. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-5: NEIGHBORHOOD DRAINAGE PLANNING/SUBDIVISION PLATS:
Before approval of the final plat, the developer shall submit to the village
plan commission for their approval, a neighborhood drainage plan, showing, but
not limited to, the following:

corners.
   (B)   Proposed elevations at all proposed lot corners indicating an adequate
front, rear and side yard surface drainage scheme, following improvements.
   (C)   Proposed first floor elevation of all structures.
   (D)   Proposed storm sewers with their sizes, slopes, number and type of
inlets, etc.
   (E)   Storm water storage facilities accompanied by design calculations and
design details for all of the above. Before occupancy permit can be granted,
all first floor elevations and lot surface elevations shall coincide with
approved proposed elevations previously submitted above. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-6: OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   (A)   Applicability: All earthmoving and grading operations not specifically
exempted by the provisions of this chapter shall comply with the applicable
standards and requirements set forth in this section, in addition to the other
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Handbooks Adopted By Reference: The standards and specifications of
"Erosion And Sediment Control Handbook, Kankakee County, Illinois", latest
edition, as compiled by the Kankakee County soil and water conservation
district and approved by the Kankakee County regional planning commission and
the Illinois environmental protection agency's "Standards And Specifications
For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control", adopted October 1987, are hereby
incorporated into this section and made a part hereof by this reference, for
the purpose of delineating procedures and methods of operation under
development plans approved in this chapter. In the event of conflict between
provisions of the said handbooks and other provisions of this chapter, the more
stringent requirements shall govern.
   (C)   Special Precautions:
      1.   If at any stage of the grading the director of building and zoning
determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further
work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property,
public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the building inspector may
require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
safety precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood
of such peril. Special precautions may include, but shall not be limited to,
specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage
facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant
materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered engineer whose
recommendations may be made requirements for further work.
      2.   Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take
such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the
public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail,
the building inspector may specify the time of starting grading and time of
completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages
so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the
advent of seasonal rains.
   (D)   Expiration Of Permit: Every site development permit shall expire by
limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has
not been commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed
within two hundred forty (240) days from date of issue; except that the
building inspector may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence
that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within
the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written
application is made before the expiration date of the said permit. (Ord. 07-20,
9-4-2007)
10-10-7: FEES AND BONDS:
   (A)   Fees: Filing and permit fees shall be set forth in the applicable
sections of this code and amendments thereto.
   (B)   Bonds: Upon approval of a site development plan or building permit
within the purview of this chapter, the developer shall post a performance bond
payable to the village, cashier's check, negotiable securities or establish an
escrow account in the amount of the estimated total cost of the site
development hereunder, as approved by the village, to ensure timely
satisfactory site development. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-8: APPEALS AND VARIATIONS:
   (A)   Review And Appeal: The building inspector is hereby authorized and
directed to enforce all the provisions of this chapter. Upon review of property
subject to this chapter, such officer may require, by written thirty (30) day
notice, that such property be brought into compliance with this chapter. Any
person aggrieved by such determination may appeal such to the plan commission
of the village under the rules of that commission.
   (B)   Variations: The plan commission may authorize variations to any of the
requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter.
      1.   Application For Variance: Application for any variation shall be
made by a verified petition of applicant stating fully the grounds of the
application and of the facts relied upon by the petitioner. For the variation
to be granted, it shall be necessary that the plan commission find all of the
following facts with respect thereto:
         (a)   That the land is of such shape or size or is affected by such
physical conditions or is subject to such title limitations or record that it
is impossible or impractical for the subdivider to comply with all of the
regulations of this chapter.
         (b)   That the variation is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right of the petitioner.
         (c)   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or injurious to other property in the vicinity of the
subject property.
      2.   Plan Commission: After public hearing thereon, the plan commission,
by resolution, may approve the site development permit application with the
variation and conditions it deems necessary or it may disapprove such site
development permit application and variation application, or it may take such
other action as is appropriate. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-9: REVOCATION OF PERMIT:
   (A)   Authority: In the event any person holding a site development permit
pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the permit, or conducts or
carries on said site development in such a manner as to materially adversely
affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the
neighborhood of the property of the said permittee, or conducts or carries on
said site development so that it is materially detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the
building inspector shall revoke or suspend the site development permit.
   (B)   Procedure For Revoking Site Development Permit: No site development
permit shall be permanently revoked or suspended until a hearing is held by the
plan commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be served upon the
permittee, either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested,
and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation or
suspension, in clear and concise language.
      2.   The time when, and the place where, such hearing is to be held. Such
notice shall be served by mailing by certified mail or personal service on the
permittee at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the hearing. At any
such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and he
may call witnesses and present evidence on his behalf. Upon conclusion of such
hearing, the plan commission shall determine whether or not the permit shall be
suspended or revoked.
      3.   The plan commission shall hold the hearing to consider
recommendations for revocation or suspension of permits which have been
temporarily suspended at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the plan
commission at which all conditions of subsection (B)2 of this section can be
fulfilled. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)
10-10-10: VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES:
   (A)   Standards And Specifications: All nonexempt developments, as set forth
in this chapter, shall comply with the standards and specifications set forth
by provisions of this chapter. It shall be unlawful for any person to initiate
such site development activities without a site development permit or building
permit or to carry on such site development activities other than as provided
in an approved site development plan. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
property improved, graded, or developed pursuant to this chapter to alter or
change such site in contravention of the site development plan or allow the
site to remain in a condition which does not conform to the site development
plan.
   (B)   Penalties: Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, shall be liable to a fine or penalty
as set forth in section
1-4-1 of this code and each day of violation shall be deemed a separate
offense. This penalty provision shall be in addition to all other rights and
remedies which the village may have, at law or equity, for an injunction or
other remedy and the village may pursue all remedies available to it in a court
or courts of law concurrently with proceeding to impose the penalties contained
therein. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)

pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the village prior to issuance of

treasurer shall be responsible for placement of such funds into a separate
account as specified.
   (C)   Establishment And Maintenance Of Account: The village treasurer shall
establish a separate interest bearing account in a bank authorized to receive

such account. The village treasurer shall maintain records for such account.
   (D)   Maintenance Of Records: The village treasurer shall maintain and keep
adequate financial records for such account, which shall show the source and
disbursement of all revenues, which shall account for all monies received, and
which shall ensure that the disbursement of funds from the account shall be

capital improvements program for the particular development subarea.
   (E)   Annual Review And Modification: The village shall annually, in
conjunction with the annual capital budget and capital improvements plan
adoption processes, review the development potential of the subarea and the
capital improvements plan, and make such modifications as are deemed necessary
as a result of:
      1.   Development occurring in the prior year;
      2.   Public facilities actually constructed;
      3.   Changing facility needs;
      4.   Inflation;
      5.   Revised cost estimates for public facilities;
      6.   Changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to
public facility projects; and
      7.   Such other factors as may be relevant.

improvement, the property owner must enter into the agreement with the village
prior to issuance of any building permit. In no event shall the village provide
a credit in an amount greater than the otherwise applicable recapture fee. If,
however, the amount of the credit is calculated to be greater than the amount
of the recapture fee due, the property owner may utilize such excess credit
toward recapture fees imposed on other building permits for development on the

future monetary and nonmonetary contributions by the developer to the
construction of the same public facility, as follows:

for a period of time as approved by the village board.
   (C)   No credits shall be given for the construction of local on site
facilities required by zoning, subdivision, or other village regulations and
not included in the capital improvements program. (Ord. 07-20, 9-4-2007)

11-1-1: SHORT TITLE:
These regulations shall be known, cited, and referenced as the DEVELOPMENT
IMPACT FEES ORDINANCE of the village of Manteno, Illinois. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-
2005)
11-1-2: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
   (A)   Since 1990, the village has ranked among the fastest developing
communities in Kankakee County and southern Will County with a growth rate
exceeding the projections expressed in its comprehensive plan adopted in 1991.
   (B)   The population of the village increased by approximately eighty five
percent (85%) from three thousand four hundred sixty five (3,465) in 1990 to
six thousand four hundred fourteen (6,414) in 2000.
   (C)   The substantial and rapid population growth of the village directly
corresponds to the increase in residential housing starts since 1990 with
housing starts increasing by over three hundred forty eight percent (348%) from
1990 (29 single-family homes) to 2003 (130 single-family homes).
   (D)   Numerous factors have contributed to growth pressures in the village,
including, without limitation, the following:
      1.   Continued urbanization of the south suburban Chicago metropolitan
region.
      2.   Proximity and access to south suburban employment centers.
      3.   The general attractiveness of the rural, small community setting
offered by the village.
      4.   The decision to designate the Peotone area in Will County as the
site of the proposed south suburban regional airport.
   (E)   In order to exercise responsible growth management in its environs,
the village annexed in excess of one thousand four hundred (1,400) acres of
land during the period from 1993 to 2004. Current growth trends are expected to
continue based on the ongoing development of such annexed areas.
   (F)   Healthful, productive, and responsible community life depends, in
part, on the availability of adequate school facilities for the residents of
the village. Manteno is served by Manteno Community Unit School District 5,
which is expected to experience an increase of one thousand seventy two (1,072)
pupils by the year 2010 according to a development and enrollment study
conducted for the district in October 2002. The study questions School District
5's ability to accommodate the projected additional students with existing
facilities. School District 5 officials anticipate that as much as seventy
million dollars ($70,000,000.00) in new facilities may be required over the
next six (6) years to accommodate the projected student increase.
   (G)   The village recognizes that park land is a vital component of the
quality of life experienced by community residents. The village commitment to
advancing its park facilities program is exemplified by actions such as the
establishment of the Manteno recreation and parks commission in 1996.
   (H)   It is declared to be the policy of the village that the provision of
various public facilities required to serve new development is subject to the
control of the village in accordance with the comprehensive plan of the village
for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development of the village.
   (I)   New development causes and imposes increased and excessive demands
upon public facilities and services that are specifically and uniquely
attributable to those developments. Affected facilities and services include
the Manteno Community Unit School District 5 and the Manteno recreation and
parks commission system.
   (J)   The dramatic increase in the construction of residential buildings in
the village is expected to continue and is expected to place ever increasing
demands on Manteno Community Unit School District 5 and the Manteno recreation
and parks commission system.
   (K)   Development potential and property values are influenced and affected
by village policy as expressed in the comprehensive plan and as implemented by
the village zoning and subdivision ordinances and the capital improvement
budget.
   (L)   To the extent that new development places demands upon public
facilities which are specifically and uniquely attributable to that
development, those demands should be satisfied by requiring that developments
creating the demands pay the cost of meeting the demands.
   (M)   The amount of the development impact fees to be required of new
development shall be determined by the proportionate share cost of the
additional public facilities needed to support such development.
   (N)   The village board, after careful consideration, hereby finds and
declares that development impact fees required of new development to finance
specified public facilities, the demand for which is created by such
development, are in the best interests of the general welfare of the village
and its residents, are equitable, and do not impose an unfair burden on such
development. Therefore, the village board deems it necessary and desirable to
adopt this title as herein set forth. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-1-3: INTENT:
This title is intended to require development impact fees, payable at the time
of building permit issuance, in an amount based upon the proportionate share of
the cost of the various public facilities required to serve new development.
(Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-1-4: DONATIONS REQUIRED:
Unless otherwise provided for in an annexation agreement with the village, as a
condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a
planned unit development, each subdivider or developer shall be required to
dedicate land and/or make cash contributions in lieu of land for acquisition of
park and school sites; and cash donations for school construction and
recreation to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the
subdivision or planned unit development as hereinafter set forth. (Ord. 04-32,
1-24-2005)
11-1-5: DONATIONS REQUIRED FROM PROPERTIES OUTSIDE VILLAGE CORPORATE LIMITS:
In the event that land that is subject to subdivision approval by the village
is not within the corporate limits of the village at the time of approval of a
final plat of subdivision for the land, the impact fee shall be payable at the
time of the approval of the final plat of subdivision, unless the subdivider or
developer shall agree in a separate agreement with some form of financial
guarantee to pay the fees at the time another governmental body issues a
building permit. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-1-6: DONATIONS COMPUTED ON PROJECTED POPULATION:
   (A)   For purposes of computing the amount of land donations or cash
contributions in lieu of land for park and school sites, and cash donations for
school construction and recreation facilities that will be required of each
subdivision or planned unit development to enable the village to provide
facilities and services to meet the needs of such subdivision or planned unit
development, its projected population density shall be computed in accordance
with the most current version of the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit set forth in sections
11-1-7, "Exhibit A, For Park Calculations",
11-1-8, "Exhibit B, For School Land Calculations", and
11-1-9, "Exhibit C, For School Construction Calculations", of this chapter.
   (B)   The current versions of the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit in sections
11-1-7,
11-1-8 and
11-1-9 of this chapter shall be used for all population estimates unless a
subdivider or developer files a written objection to the village data, together
with his or her own demographic study showing the estimated population to be
generated by his or her subdivision or planned unit development. In that event,
the final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations
shall be made by the village's corporate authorities on the basis of the most
current version of the table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling
unit, data submitted by the subdivider or developer, and from other sources
which may be submitted to the village's corporate authorities by Manteno
Community Unit School District 5 and the Manteno recreation and parks
commission.
   (C)   Population density, age distribution and local conditions change over
the years and, accordingly, the table of estimated ultimate population per
dwelling unit in sections
11-1-7,
11-1-8 and
11-1-9 of this chapter shall be subject to periodic review and amendment, as
necessary, and in the sole and absolute discretion of the village's corporate
authorities. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)

11-2-1: LAND CONTRIBUTION TO SCHOOL DISTRICT:
School sites shall be donated and conveyed to the village in accordance with
the following criteria:
   (A)   Number Of Students: The ultimate number of students that will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development shall be
determined in accordance with the current version of the table of estimated
ultimate population per dwelling unit, set forth in section
11-1-8, "Exhibit B, For School Land Calculations", of this title.
   (B)   Land Donation To School: The amount of land required to be dedicated
shall be determined by dividing the estimated number of children in each of the
school age brackets hereinafter set forth that will be generated by the
proposed subdivision or planned unit development by the maximum recommended
number of students that can be served in the type of school assigned to such
age bracket, hereinafter set forth, and multiplying the quotient times the
minimum number of acres recommended for a school site, hereinafter set forth.
The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient
land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such
school classification.
   (C)   School Classifications And Size Of School Site: School classifications
and size of school sites shall be determined in accordance with the following
criteria:
 
                          Maximum Number Of Students Minimum Number Of Acres Of

subject to periodic review by Manteno Community Unit School District 5, and
School District 5 may request that the village's corporate authorities amend
such data from time to time. Any such request shall be made in writing by a
resolution adopted by the corporate authorities of School District 5.
   (D)   Location Of School Site: The comprehensive plan of the village shall
be used as a guideline in locating sites.
   (E)   Improved Sites: Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in
accordance with the village subdivision ordinance. All sites shall be conveyed
in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets
(including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location
of the site, or acceptable provision made therefor. The sidewalks and trees
normally included within the definition of improved sites may be deferred due
to the delay time between conveyance of any such school sites and construction
of school facilities thereon.
   (F)   School Land Conveyed To The Village: School land conveyed to the
village shall be held by it for transfer to Manteno Community Unit School
District 5. Any school land conveyed to the village or thereafter transferred

(Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-2-2: CASH CONTRIBUTION TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS:
   (A)   In addition to the land donation referred to in section
11-2-1 of this chapter, or a cash contribution in lieu of land referred to in
section
11-5-5 of this title, each subdivider or developer shall be required to make a
cash contribution to aid in the provision of necessary funds for the
construction, expansion or rehabilitation of a school for the use of the
children who will be generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit
development, or for other improvements to the extent required in whole or part
by the existence of a school.
   (B)   The amount of the cash donation shall be determined by multiplying the
estimated number of children in the K-12 school age bracket that will be
generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development times one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per child as shown in section
11-1-9, "Exhibit C, For School Construction Calculations", of this title. The
contribution required for school construction shall be regularly updated,
pursuant to section
11-5-6 of this title. Funds contributed by a developer pursuant to this section
shall be deposited with the village treasurer to be held in a special fund
which shall not be used for any purpose other than for payment of the cost of
school construction, expansion or rehabilitation or for other improvements to
the extent required in whole or in part by the existence of a school. Any
interest which accrues shall also be used for the purposes set forth in this
section. Any cash donated to the village for school construction or expansion
purposes pursuant to this section which has not been expended for those
purposes within twenty (20) years shall be refunded to the developer.
   (C)   This cash contribution is a requirement of the village subdivision
code. However, in order not to make this requirement over onerous and to assist
developers in meeting this financial responsibility, the cash contributions
required in this section shall, unless specifically provided otherwise, be
payable upon the issuance of the building permit for each dwelling unit. (Ord.
04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-2-3: CONTRIBUTIONS; ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SERVICES:

resolution at any time within five (5) years after approval of a plat of
subdivision or planned unit development that a land donation or cash in lieu of
a land donation will not be required by that School District 5 within the next
five (5) years to accommodate the number of students projected to be generated
by a proposed subdivision or planned unit development, but that such projected
number of students shall require the hiring of additional teachers and
expansion and creation of new programs, in order to provide School District 5
with funds to provide such services before tax revenues are generated by such
new subdivision or planned unit development, a cash contribution in the amount
of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00) per student shall be made to the village
on the basis of the most current version of the estimated ultimate population
per dwelling unit in section
11-1-8, "Exhibit B, For School Land Calculations", of this title, and all such
funds shall be paid over by the village to School District 5. The contribution
required for school services shall be regularly updated pursuant to section
11-5-6 of this title.

generated by the proposed subdivision or planned unit development shall be
determined in accordance with the most current version of the table of
estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit in section
11-1-7, "Exhibit A, For Park Calculations", of this title. The amount of land
required to be dedicated for park sites in each subdivision or planned unit
development shall be determined by dividing the estimated population of such
subdivision or planned unit development by one thousand (1,000) and multiplying
the quotient times 8.8 acres of park land required for each one thousand
(1,000) people.
   (B)   Location Of Park Sites:
      1.   Except for combined school/park sites, as defined in chapter 4 of
this title, the comprehensive plan adopted by the village shall be used as a
guideline in locating sites. If the village has not planned a park within the
subdivision or planned unit development or the neighborhood in which the
subdivision or planned unit development is located, the park site shall be so
located as to be readily accessible to the people within such neighborhood.
Play and athletic fields and large park sites must be conveniently accessible
to the community at large.
      2.   Proper ingress, egress and curb cuts shall be provided. For water
areas, provisions must be made for pathway/driveway around these areas for
emergency vehicles and police patrol. Provisions for major use of a pathway/
driveway for bike riding, walkway, jogging trail and pedestrian traffic shall
be made.
   (C)   Environmental Quality:
      1.   Land to be dedicated for park sites shall be approved by the village
according to its environmental quality, as well as its suitability for active
and passive recreational activities. The land is to be dry and usable at all
times and not subject to flooding or used as detention. Should a donation
include a detention/retention area over and above the 8.8 acres required per
one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population estimated to be generated by the
development, the village may accept such additional land. No bogs or swamps
shall be acceptable as required park sites. Lakes and native prairie wetlands
shall not normally be acceptable, but may be approved by the village where the
area offers an exceptional amenity or the chance to protect a significant
natural resource. No site that has been part of an unlicensed landfill or a
toxic waste dump shall be acceptable as required park acreage.
      2.   Every effort shall be made to conserve for public use and enjoyment
those areas of significant natural and environmental value. Except in those
specific areas designated by the village for development as playfields or other
active areas, all trees, other plant materials, streams and other natural
features shall be retained on land to be dedicated for park site use, unless
specifically cited by the village for removal by the developer.
   (D)   Shape: Dedicated park sites shall be regularly configured to permit
efficient park programming, security and maintenance. Sites shall be
rectangular, or nearly rectangular, in shape with no interior angle of the
boundary line less than sixty degrees (60°), unless specifically approved by
the village. Narrow strips of land, small parcels that intrude into adjacent
orderly development, or leftover parcels that are oddly shaped or located shall
be avoided.
   (E)   Improvements:
      1.   Prior to conveyance, all sites shall be prepared in accordance with
the village subdivision ordinance and the village's storm water management
requirements, except as varied by the specific terms of this title. In
addition, in the event that a park site includes retention/detention areas,
slopes must be mowable and shall not exceed a five to one (5:1) slope. Those
areas, where by necessity and subject to the approval of the village engineer,
the grade exceeds five to one (5:1), must have a covering of flagstone or crown
vetch which eliminates the need to mow. All areas must be final graded and
seeded to meet park district specifications as to seed mixture.
      2.   All sites shall be conveyed in a condition ready for full service of
electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and
gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made
therefor. In addition, location of hydrants shall be made in conformance with
village requirements. Provision for water for watering vegetation and flooding
for ice skating shall be made where appropriate. Sewers for possible
installation of restrooms/shelter at a later date shall be provided.
Electricity for streetlights for future lighting for shelters and security
shall be provided. Security lighting along pathway shall be provided. (Ord. 04-
32, 1-24-2005)
11-3-2: CREDIT FOR PRIVATE OPEN SPACES AND RECREATION AREAS:
   (A)   When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for
recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a
portion of the park and recreational area in subdivisions or planned unit
developments may, at the option of the village's corporate authorities, be
provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open
space. The extent of such private open space shall be determined by the
village's corporate authorities, based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the
general area.
   (B)   In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks
will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his or
her obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of
facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village's corporate
authorities, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the
subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will
be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate
legal documents. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-3-3: RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND:
Where the comprehensive or official plan of the village calls for a larger
amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular proposed
subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to
dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall, if so
determined by the village's corporate authorities, be reserved for subsequent
purchase by the village; provided, that such acquisition is made within one
year from the date of approval of the final plat. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)

11-5-5: CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN LIEU OF LAND:
Criteria for requiring cash contributions in lieu of land donations:
   (A)   Small Land Donations: Whenever, in the determination of the village,
any subdivision or planned unit development is so small that the school or park
sites required under the provisions of sections
11-2-1 and
11-3-1 and/or chapter 4 of this title will not be large enough for practical
development and maintenance as school or park sites, or when the available land
cannot meet the standards set forth in sections
11-2-1 and
11-3-1 of this title, or is otherwise inappropriate for park or recreational
purposes or for a school site, the village shall require the subdivider or
developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication required.
   (B)   Cash Contribution: The cash contribution to be paid in lieu of land
donations for school sites shall be held in trust by the village solely for use
in the acquisition of a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of
children from that subdivision or planned unit development, or for
reimbursement to Manteno Community Unit School District 5 for prior acquisition
of school sites for which bonds or other financing obligations are outstanding
which will serve immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or
planned unit development, or for the improvement of any existing school site
which predominantly serves such needs, but not for the construction, repair or
rehabilitation of any school building or addition thereto.
   (C)   Cash Contribution For Park And Recreational Purposes: The cash
contribution to be paid in lieu of land donations for park and recreational
purposes shall be designated by the village solely for the acquisition of park
and recreational land which will be available to serve the immediate or future
needs of the residents of that subdivision or planned unit development or for
the improvement of existing park and recreational lands which predominantly
serve such needs.
   (D)   Time Limit For Cash Expenditure: If any portion of a cash contribution
in lieu of park or recreational land donations, or school site donations made
pursuant to this section is not expended for the purposes above set forth
within twenty (20) years from the date of its receipt, it shall be refunded to
the subdivider or developer who made such contribution.
   (E)   Fair Market Value: The amount of cash contributions in lieu of land
shall be based on the "fair market value" of land in the proposed subdivision
or planned unit development improved as specified in sections
11-2-1 and
11-3-1 of this title that otherwise would have been donated for park,
recreational and school sites. The village's corporate authorities have
determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and
surrounding village is forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00) per acre. Such
figure shall be regularly updated pursuant to section
11-5-6 of this chapter, and shall be used in making any calculation herein
unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the
event of any such written objection, the developer shall submit an appraisal
showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of his or her
development or other evidence thereof and final determination of such fair
market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the corporate
authorities based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or
developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the corporate
authorities by the park district, school districts or others.
   (F)   Combinations: There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit
developments when, in the determination of the village, a combination of land
donation and cash contribution in lieu of land is appropriate. These occasions
will arise when:
      1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the
subdivision or planned unit development falling within the park or school site
shall be conveyed as aforesaid, and cash shall be donated by the developer, and
cash shall be donated in an amount equal to the difference between the fair
market value of the land donated and the fair market value of the land required
to be donated under sections
11-2-1 and
11-3-1 of this title.
      2.   A major part of a local park or recreation site or school site has
already been acquired and only a small amount of land is needed from the
proposed subdivision or planned unit development to complete the site. The
remaining amount of land shall be donated by the developer, and cash shall be
donated in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of
the land donated and the fair market value of the land required to be donated
under sections
11-2-1 and
11-3-1 of this title.
   (G)   Prorated: The cash contributions required in this section shall be
prorated and payable upon the issuance of the building permit for each dwelling
unit. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)
11-5-6: UPDATING OF REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS AND FAIR MARKET VALUE:
Population density, age distribution, land values, the cost of providing park,
school and village services, construction costs and other local conditions
change over the years. Therefore, the specific formula for the dedication of
land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, the required contribution for
school construction, police, fire, library and administrative services, and the
fair market value of land in and around the village shall be reviewed at least
every two (2) years and amended as necessary, and in the sole and absolute
discretion of the village's corporate authorities. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-2005)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this title, any impact fees
established in an annexation agreement between the village and a developer or
subdivider shall supersede the fees otherwise established in this title,
including any fees otherwise provided for in chapter 5 of this title, and the
terms of payment of any such impact fees in an annexation agreement provide
that impact fees are to be paid in accordance with this title, then the amount
and manner of payment provided in this title shall apply. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-
2005)
CHAPTER 7
INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES
SECTION:
11-7-1: Intergovernmental Agreement
11-7-1: INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT:
Manteno Community Unit School District 5 shall be required, as a condition of
receiving the dedications or donations hereunder, to enter into a binding,
written intergovernmental agreement with the village, acceptable in form and
content to the village attorney, providing for the indemnification and holding
harmless of the village from any loss, claims and causes of actions of every
kind that may be incurred by the village as a result, either directly or
indirectly, of the enactment of this title, or the administration or
enforcement thereof, including any loss, claims, or causes of action incurred
as a result of a lawsuit brought or threatened by School District 5. The
intergovernmental agreement shall provide that if the village is sued by any
subdivider or developer as a result, directly or indirectly, of the enactment
of this title, the village may, at its option, undertake the defense, and the
village's costs and expenses related thereto, including attorney fees, shall be
immediately reimbursed by School District 5, as the case may be. Unless
otherwise specifically provided, the provisions of this title shall be an
implied condition of every intergovernmental agreement entered into pursuant to
this title. Where the Manteno Community Unit School District 5 improperly uses
funds or fails to use funds and does not return same as specified in this
title, the village may sue School District 5 and shall be entitled to recover
as a part of the judgment therein, or any settlement thereof, all costs and
expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the village. (Ord. 04-32, 1-24-
2005)
