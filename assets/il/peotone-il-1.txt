claim of improper governmental action. IMPROPER GOVERNMENTAL ACTION does not

other disciplinary action made because of an employee's protected activity
under this policy.
   (D)   To the extent allowed by law, the identity of an employee reporting
information about an improper governmental action shall be kept confidential
unless the employee waives confidentiality in writing. Auditing officials may
take reasonable measures to protect employees who reasonably believe they may
be subject to bodily harm for reporting improper government action.
   (E)   The duties of the auditing official include: receiving and
investigating any employee complaint of retaliation; and receiving, registering
and investigating complaints and information concerning misconduct,
inefficiency and waste within the village.

seq.), the Village of Peotone desires to establish rules and procedures that
will allow appointed and elected members of boards, commissions and committees
to attend, participate and vote at open and closed public meetings through the
use of telephone conference calls or other electronic means, provided that such
attendance is in compliance with these rules and any applicable laws.
(Ord. 25-01, passed 1-13-25)
§ 41.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions of the terms MEETING, PUBLIC BODY, OTHER MEANS, QUORUM,  or
any other defined term used in this chapter, which are also found in the Open
Meetings Act, shall have the same definitions as contained in the Open Meetings
Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120, §§ 1 et seq.), as amended.
(Ord. 25-01, passed 1-13-25)
§ 41.03 RULES AND PROCEDURES.

applicable requirements of the Open Meetings Act (ILCS Ch. 5, Act 120 §§ 1 et
seq.), as amended.

establishing a quorum to conduct business at an open or closed meeting through
the attendance of board members by the use of telephone conference calls or
other electronic means. A guorum of members of a Village board, commission or
committee must be physically present at the location of an open or closed
meeting.
   (C)   Village officials who wish to attend a meeting through a telephone
conference call or other electronic means must give notice before the
commencement of the meeting to the recording secretary or the Village Clerk,
unless advance notice is impractical. Inability to make the necessary technical
arrangements to allow electronic participation will result in denial of a
request for remote attendance.
   (D)   Meeting minutes must reflect whether a member is present physically or
electronically, regardless of whether any members are attending through the use
of a telephone conference call or other electronic means.
   (E)   Provided that the audio, telephone or video conference connection
allows the voice of an absent member to be clearly heard by the attendees of
the meeting (including the public) and the absent member can clearly hear the
voices of the attendees who participate in the meeting, a member of a Village
board, committee and commission may attend, participate and vote at an open or
closed meeting through the use of a telephone conference call or other
electronic means if the member is prevented from physically attending because
of:
      (1)   Personal illness or disability;
      (2)   Employment purposes or the business of the public body;
      (3)   A family or other emergency; or
      (4)   Unexpected childcare obligations.
   (F)   Where one or more members of a Village board, committee and commission
is attending the meeting by use of a telephone conference call or other
electronic means, the presiding officer shall, immediately after convening of
the meeting, announce to the public which member is attending the meeting by
use of a telephone conference call or other electronic means, identify the
method of attendance and the reason why the absent member is participating by
such means. The member will be deemed authorized to attend the meeting
electronically unless a motion objecting to the member's electronic attendance
is made, seconded, and approved by two-thirds of the members of the public body
physically present at the meeting. If no such motion is made and seconded or if
any such motion fails to achieve the required vote by the members of the public
body physically present at the meeting, then the request by the member to
attend the meeting through a telephone conference call or other electronic
means shall be deemed approved by the public body and the presiding officer
shall declare the requesting member present. After such declaration by the
presiding officer, the question of a member's electronic attendance may not be
reconsidered.
   (G)   If the presiding officer of the public body is attending the meeting
by telephone conference call or other electronic means, then the person who
acts in the absence of the presiding officer shall chair the meeting. If there
is none, then the presiding officer shall appoint a member of the public body
who is physically present at the meeting to serve as chair of the meeting. The
appointment of a chair shall be subject to the advice and consent of the public
body. The presiding officer who is participating by electronic means shall be
authorized to participate in the meeting to the extent authorized by law or
ordinance except for those acts involved with chairing the meeting.
   (H)   The voice of the absent member participating by telephone conference
call or other electronic means, after being identified by the other Village
board, committee and commission members as belonging to the absent member,
shall be simultaneously broadcast to the public present at the meeting so that
his or her voice can be heard, and the member shall also be able to hear any
discussions of the other members and the public comment regarding any issue
discussed at the meeting before a vote is taken.

occupant(s) of the premises and the user(s) of the service, if different. Such
notice shall state that the delinquency could create a lien on the real estate
involved. Such delinquent charges shall constitute liens upon the real estate
upon or for which the services have been supplied. The Village Clerk when
directed by the appropriate village official shall file a statement of lien
claim and give notice of such delinquencies in the office of the County
Recorder of Deeds. The lien claim shall contain the legal description of the
premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village
claims a lien for this amount as well as for all other charges subsequent to
the period covered by the bill, including attorneys' fees and costs incurred by
the village in connection with preparing and filing said lien claim and in any
foreclosure of lien court proceedings. In addition, the village may also sue
the owner, occupant or user of the real estate in a civil action to recover
such delinquent charges. A copy of the notice of lien shall be sent to the
taxpayer whose name is shown on the tax bill for the parcel involved as the
owner of record. The lien authority and procedures set forth herein are
additional to and separate from the power to terminate service as set forth in
§
51.011 of this chapter.
   (B)   The failure of the Village Collector to record such lien or to mail
such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect
the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in the foregoing
sections.
   (C)   Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for non-
payment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the
charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory
liens. Such foreclosure shall be by billing in equity in the name of the
village. The Village Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute
such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction
over such matters against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid
for 110 days.

51.009 hereof, or if there is any other violation of the provisions of this
chapter relating to service in connection with a particular piece of property,
then service shall be discontinued upon written notice given at least 72 hours
before service is to be discontinued. The 72 hour written notice may be given

service, if different than the owner, shall be entitled to a hearing before the
Village President, or his designee, upon filing of a written request with the
Village Clerk for a hearing within 72 hours after receipt of such notice. This
request shall state the reasons why service should not be discontinued. A
hearing will be held within 72 hours after receipt of the request for a hearing
if possible, but in any event shall be held prior to discontinuing service. The
decision of the Village President, made after hearing regarding whether to
discontinue service, shall be final. Service shall not be reinstated once
terminated until all past-due bills including the additional charges thereon
are paid in full, together with payment of $100 for reinstating such service,
and reimbursement in full of the attorney's fees incurred by the village in
having the Village Attorney attend any such hearing.
   (C)   If a hearing is required to be held according to any provision of this
chapter, the Village Attorney may attend any such hearing. In the event the
decision is to discontinue service, the owner of the premises, and the
occupants of the premises and users of the service if different than the owner,
shall be required jointly and severally to reimburse the village for its
attorney's fees. Service will not be resumed until reimbursement in full of all
village expenses is made, including attorney's fees.

directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
   (E)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Plumbing
Inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be inspected and
approved by the Superintendent or his representative before being concealed or
backfilled. If any person refuses or neglects to disconnect any sewer connected
in violation of this section, the village may disconnect the sewer at the
expense of the property owner from whose premises sewer connected in violation
hereof extends.
   (F)   Any person filling in an excavation without having first received the
written approval of the Sewer Inspector or Zoning Administrator as provided in
this chapter, shall, in addition to suffering the fine herein imposed, expose
the sewer for inspection by the Superintendent or Zoning Administrator at no
cost to the village. In any case where the Zoning Administrator finds the work
on any sewer not done in a satisfactory manner as herein provided, he shall
serve written notice on the person to whom the permit is issued, stating
wherein such work is deficient, and ordering said person to remedy such defect
within 24 hours. In the event such person fails to comply therewith, the Zoning
Administrator shall cause such defect to be corrected at the expense of the
person to whom the permit was issued. The sum of $25 as herein provided shall
be paid to the Clerk as a fee for the performance of the Zoning Administrator,
and it shall be the duty of the Inspector to inspect any sewer connection or
sewer pipe within the village. It shall also be the duty of the Inspector to
inform the Approving Authority of any violation of this chapter, and to assist
in the prosecution of offenders. All excavations for building sewer
installation shall comply with the provisions of this code relating to
excavations in streets and shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways,

wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or
upon suitable samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required the control manhole shall be considered to be
the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all
outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should
be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD5 and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined
from periodic grab samples.

WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES
§ 51.145 ADOPTION OF ENGINEERING REPORT.
   The user charge system hereinafter set forth has been developed from data
outlined in the report of Robinson Engineering, Ltd., South Holland, Illinois
entitled "Report on Development of User Charges for the Wastewater System of
the Village of Peotone, Will County, Illinois dated September, 1989"; said
report being incorporated herein by reference and which shall constitute the
basis for determining user charges in the village.
(Ord. 89-12-B, passed 12-26-89)
§ 51.146 BASIS FOR WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   The wastewater service charges for the use of and for service supplied
by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user
charge to pay expenses of operation, maintenance and replacement of the system;
a fixed debt service/capital improvement charge; a variable debt service rate
and a surcharge, if applicable.
      (1)   Basic user charge.
         (a)   The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded
by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal
volume and concentrations:
            1.   Flow of 5,000 gallons per quarterly period.
            2.   A five-day, 20° C. bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 200
mg/l.
            3.   A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l.
         (b)   It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus
replacement and shall be computed as follows:
            1.   Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and
maintain the wastewater facilities, including a replacement fund, for the next
fiscal year for all works categories.
            2.   Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility
categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD5.
            3.   Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD5 to
be treated.
            4.   Compute unit costs for volume (dollars per 1,000 gallons), for
suspended solids (Dollars per lb.) and BOD5 (Dollars per lb.).
            5.   Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for volume, SS and BOD5 at
normal sewage strength. Add these costs to determine the charge for operation
and maintenance including replacement.
      (2)   Debt service charge. A debt service charge, consisting of a fixed
charge per billing period in such amount as the President and Board of Trustees
may determine, applicable to each unit connected to the system, which shall
include apartment units and other units in multiple use structures, shall be
charged in order to pay part of the annual principal and interest requirements,
including a sinking fund and other reserves necessary therefor.
      (3)   Debt service rate. A debt service rate consisting of a rate per
1,000 gallons of usage shall be determined by dividing the balance of the
amount required to pay annual principal and interest requirements, (after
deducting revenue received from the fixed debt service charge) by the total
number of gallons billed in the preceding fiscal year for sewer service.
      (4)   Surcharge. A surcharge will be levied upon all users whose wastes
exceed the normal concentrations for BOD5 (200 mg/l), and suspended solids (250
mg/l). The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters
and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed these parameters. Section
51.148 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
   (B)   The wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by the
Village Board of Trustees. The service charge shall be revised periodically to
reflect the change in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance
including replacement costs.
(Ord. 89-12-B, passed 12-26-89)
§ 51.147 MEASUREMENT OF FLOW.
   The volume of flow used for computing user charges and surcharges shall be
metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 1,000 gallons.
   (A)   If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any
part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks
system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person
shall, if directed by the Superintendent, install and maintain, at his expense,
water meters of a type approved by the Plumbing Inspector for the purpose of
determining the volume of water obtained from these sources.
   (B)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required
by the Superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the
metered water consumption records.
   (C)   Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be
installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and
installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled,
without the consent of the Superintendent.
(Ord. 89-12-B, passed 12-26-89)
§ 51.148 QUARTERLY RATE FOR SEWER SERVICE.
   For each residential, commercial, industrial and municipal user of the sewer
service of the combined waterworks and sewerage system there shall be a
quarterly charge or rate based upon the amount of water consumed, as shown by
water meters, each quarterly period as follows:
   (A)   Basic user rate (OM&R).
      (1)   A basic user rate to pay all expenses associated with operation and
maintenance and replacement of the sewerage system is hereby established in the
amount of $1.36 per 1,000 gallons.
      (2)   A minimum charge in the amount of $6.80 per quarter is hereby
established to pay that part of operation, maintenance and replacement expense
entitled administrative expense. The minimum charge will allow for the use of
5,000 gallons per quarter.
   (B)   Capital Improvement Fund (CIP) Charge. A capital improvement fund and/
or debt service charge to pay the cost of the repair and improvement of the
sewerage system and/or debt service on bonds or other form if indebtedness
issued or incurred for that purpose, is hereby established in the amount of
$14.99 per quarter for each single metered and multiple unit users of the
sewerage system. The capital improvement and/or debt service charge shall be in
addition to the minimum charge per quarter described above which allows the use
of 5,000 gallons per quarter.
   (C)   Total. The total of the basic user charge and capital improvement and/
or debt service charge is hereby summarized as follows:
      First 5,000 gallons per quarter - $21.79 (minimum charge)
      Over 5,000 gallons per quarter - 1.36 per one thousand gallons
   (D)   Outside the corporate limits. For each residential, commercial,
industrial and/or institutional user of the sewerage service located outside
the corporate limits of the village, the charge for sewer service, either a
single metered user or each additional unit served through a single meter,
shall be as follows:
      For the first 5,000 gallons - $32.69
      For all over 5,000 gallons - 2.04 per thousand gallons
   The minimum quarterly charge for sewer service for each user outside the
corporate limits shall be $32.69 per user.
   (E)   Non-metered users.  
      (1)   All non-metered users of the sewerage system and facilities shall
pay a minimum flat rate charge per quarter which shall be adequate in amount to
cover the cost of operation, maintenance, expansion and replacement of the
system and the charge for capital replacement and/or debt service by the basic
user charge and the charge for capital improvements on the bonds or other form
of debt service.
      (2)   For this purpose, non-metered usage has been calculated on the
basis of 20,000 gallons per quarter and such flat rate charges will allow the
use of 20,000 gallons per quarter.
      (3)   Non-metered users located outside the corporate limits of the
village and not subject to property taxes of the village shall pay 150% of the
regular village capital improvement and/or debt service charges. The flat rate
charge for non-metered users located both within and outside the corporate
limits are calculated as follows:
 
                            Per Quarter
                            Within the corporate limits Outside the corporate
                                                        limits
Minimum basic user charge   $ 6.80                      $ 6.80
(5,000 gallons)
15,000 gallons @ basic user 20.40                       20.40
rate (BUR)
Capital improvement         14.99                       22.49(150%)
Total flat rate             $ 42.19/qtr.                $ 49.69/qtr.
 
   (F)   Multiple connections. A multiple unit user is defined as any
additional number of residential or commercial units located on the same
premises and being served through a single water meter or sewer connection
where there are no separate water meters for each such residential or
commercial unit, such as apartment buildings, trailer courts, or commercial and
residential units located within the same building. In all such cases, there
shall be an additional capital service and/or debt service charge for each
additional unit provided with sewer service and served by a single connection.
The additional capital improvement and/or debt service charge for each such
unit shall be added to the bill computed in a manner hereinabove set forth.
   (G)   Surcharge rates and charges. The rate of surcharge for BOD and
suspended solids shall be as follows:
      (1)   For bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD5)   $0.153/lb
      (2)   For suspended solids   0.079/lb
      (3)   The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula:
S         = V (0.00834) (A(BOD5-200) + B (SS-250)
Where S   = Amount of surcharge in Dollars
V         = Wastewater volume in 1,000 gallons per billing period
(0.00864) = Unit weight of water x 10-6 per 1,000 gallons
A         = Unit charge for BOD5 per lb.
BOD5      = 5 day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/l
B         = Unit charge for SS per lb.
SS        = Suspended solids, mg/l
 
      (4)   The concentration of waste used for computing surcharges shall be
established by waste sampling. Waste sampling shall be performed as often as
may be deemed necessary by the Superintendent and shall be binding as a basis
for surcharge.
   (H)   Effective date/Future increases. This section shall be in full force
and effect with rates and charges established herein taking effect on the third
quarter billing period of 1997. Thereafter, and unless altered by proper action
of the President and Board of Trustees of the Village, the above rates shall
automatically increase at the rate of 3% per annum, with effective date for
said future 3% increases taking effect as of April 1 for each calendar year
hereafter.
   (I)   Pool fill rebates.
      (1)   Persons filling a new swimming pool installed with an approved
building permit and persons re-filling a pool following repair work that
required draining the entire pool are eligible for rebates on sewer charges on
the water consumed for that purpose. Receipts must be supplied to the village
to document the repair work. The owner must supply information relative to the
size of the pool and gallons used for eligibility. However, in no event shall
the corresponding bill be less than the minimum quarterly bill.
      (2)   Pool “top-off” and partial fills are not eligible for rebate and
will be charged at regular rates.

following formula:
WC       = M + (V-5,000) BUR + DSC + (V-5,000) DSR + S
Where WC = Amount of wastewater service charge in dollars per billing period
M        = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement expense
V        = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period
5,000    = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge
BUR      = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement expense
DSC      = Debt service charge for the fixed charge applicable to payment of
           debt service
DSR      = Debt service rate in dollars per billing period for the remainder of
           debt service cost

shall be conducted by a hearing officer who is an attorney licensed to practice
law in Illinois for a minimum of three years. At the conclusion of the hearing,

overruling the vehicle impoundment. If after a hearing, it is determined that
the motor vehicle was used in the commission of any of the violations described
in division (A) of this section, the motor vehicle shall continue to be
impounded until the owner pays a penalty of $500 plus fees for towing and
storage of the motor vehicle. The penalty and fees shall be a debt due and
owing the village. However, if a cash bond has been posted, the bond shall be
applied to the penalty. If it is determined at a administrative hearing that
the motor vehicle was not used in such a violation, the vehicle or cash bond
shall be returned without penalty or other fees. All final decisions of the
administrative hearing officer shall be subject to review under the provisions
of the Illinois Administrative Review Law. Unless the administrative hearing
officer overturns the basis for the vehicle impoundment, no vehicle shall be
released to the owner, lessee, or lienholder of record until all administrative
penalties and towing and storage charges are paid. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this section, whenever a person with a lien of record against a
motor vehicle impounded under this section has commenced foreclosure
proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to that person if
he or she agrees in writing to refund to the city the net proceeds of any
foreclosure sale, less any amount necessary to pay all lienholders of record,
up to the total amount of fees and penalties imposed under this section.
      (4)   Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 35 days after the
expiration of the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the city's action under this section, or the time at which a final
judgment is rendered in favor of the city, or the time a final administrative
decision is rendered against an owner of record who is in default, shall be
deemed abandoned and may be disposed of as an abandoned or unclaimed motor
vehicle as provided by law in accordance with the provisions of Article II of
Chapter 4 of the Illinois Vehicle Code (ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 4-201 et seq.),

vehicle's location is reported to the Chief of Police within seven days of the
date on which the vehicle was placed on said property.
      (4)   Nothing shall excuse any person who violates any provision of this

their parent or guardian, attending physician, veterinarian, and any other
appropriate source to coordinate information, and make referral of patient and
recommend treatment.
   (B)   It is unlawful for a physician, nurse, police officer, or any other
person knowing or suspecting that a person has been bitten by an animal or
having reason to believe that the wet saliva has come in direct contact with
fresh, open, or raw, pre-existent abrasions, to refuse or fail to notify the
Village Police Department or the Village Health Inspector immediately.
('70 Code, § 6.9) (Ord. passed 3-22-82) Penalty, see §

§ 91.43 CONFINEMENT OF BITING ANIMALS; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dog, or other animal, when
notified by the Police Department or Health Inspector that such dog or other
animal has bitten any person, to sell or give away such dog or other animal or
to permit or allow such dog, or other animal, to be taken beyond the limits of
the village. It shall be the duty of such owner of a biting animal, upon
receiving notice from the Police Department or Health Inspector to deliver said
dog, or other animal within 24 hours to a licensed veterinarian for confinement
and observation, at the expense of the owner, for a period of ten days. The
veterinarian confining and observing the biting dog or other animal, shall
report immediately by telephone, in person, or by other than use of the mail,
and shall confirm in writing to the Police Department or Health Inspector
within 24 hours after the dog or other animal is presented for confinement and
observation, the clinical condition of the dog or other animal; the owner's
name, address, and the date of confinement; the breed, description, age, and
sex of the dog, or other animal on forms provided by the village. Within 24
hours after the end of the confinement and observation period, the licensed
veterinarian shall submit a written report to the Police Chief or Health
Inspector advising him of the final disposition of such dog or other animal on
forms provided by the village.
   (B)   (1)   If however, the dog or other animal is examined by a licensed
veterinarian within 24 hours after notifications by the Police Department or
Health Inspector and found to be free of signs of rabies and the examining
veterinarian has presented evidence that such dog or other animal has been
inoculated against rabies more than 30 days prior to the biting and less than
one year if a one- year immunity vaccine is used, or less than three years if a
three-year immunity vaccine is used and the bite occurred below the shoulder of
the bitten person, home confinement of the biting dog or other animal for the
ten-day period may be allowed by the Administrator upon the recommendation of
the examining veterinarian provided the dog or other animal is confined in the
house of its owner; and in a manner that will prohibit such dog or other animal
from escaping and from biting any person or animal for the ten-day period.
Should the animal become ill, die, or escape during the ten-day period, the
owner shall immediately notify the Police Department or Health Inspector.
      (2)   At the end of the ten-day confinement period, the owner shall
present the dog or other animal for re-examination by the examining
veterinarian. If the dog or other animal is confined as described in this
division, the examining veterinarian shall report to the Police Department or
Health Inspector the clinical condition of the dog or other animal immediately,
by telephone, in person, or by other than the use of the mail, as described in
division (A) of this section, with subsequent written reports within 24 hours
of the beginning of confinement and 24 hours after the completion of
confinement. If the owner fails to present the dog or other animal for re-
examination by the examining veterinarian within 24 hours of the completion of
the ten-day confinement period, the examining veterinarian shall notify the
Police Department or Health Inspector of this fact immediately, by telephone,
in person, or by other than use of the mail.
   (C)   If the dog or other animal escapes from the house of its owner during
the ten-day home confinement period or if the owner fails to deliver the dog,
or other animal to a licensed veterinarian for re-examination within 24 hours
of the completion of the ten-day confinement period, the owner is hereby
declared to be in violation of this section and is subject to the penalties
provided elsewhere in this chapter. In addition, the owner of an escaped dog or
other animal shall immediately apprehend it and deliver it to a licensed
veterinarian for confinement, at the owner's expense, for the remainder of the
ten-day period.
   (D)   In those cases where the owner or keeper of a dog or other animal
which has bitten any person, refuses to deliver said dog or other animal within
24 hours after receiving notice from the Police Department or Health Inspector
to a licensed veterinarian of their choice for confinement and observation, the
Animal Control Officer is authorized to seize and impound at a veterinary
hospital said dog, or other animal for a period of ten days at the expense of
the owner. The biting animal shall not be released by the Animal Control
Officer until all costs of seizure, examination, confinement, observation,
notification, and inoculation has been paid by the owner or keeper of said dog
or other animal.
   (E)   The owner of a dog four months of age or older, not currently
inoculated against rabies, as provided elsewhere in this chapter, must have the
dog inoculated against rabies at the time of release from confinement.

notify the owner, agent and/or occupant of any lands on which a nuisance
exists, in writing, via personal service or registered or certified mail, of
such fact. Failure of the Building Administrator to give such notice shall not,
however, constitute a defense to any action to enforce the payment of any
penalty provided for under the provisions of this chapter. Any owner, agent or
occupant, who shall refuse or neglect to abate the nuisance as provided for in

upon such lands to abate such nuisance, or cause to have the nuisance abated by
some private person at reasonable cost, keeping an account of the expense
thereof. Express power to so enter upon such lands and abate the nuisance is
hereby conferred upon the Manager of Streets and Alleys or his or her agent. In
addition to the penalties provided in this chapter, such expense shall be
charged to and paid by the owner or occupant of the premises concerned. In the
event the nuisance abated concerned high weeds, rat or pest extermination, the
removal of trees with Dutch Elm disease, or the removal of garbage or debris,
the abatement costs incurred by the village shall constitute a lien on said
property until fully discharged. Such lien may be created and recorded as set
forth in Sections 11-20-7, 11-20-8, 11-20-12 and 11-20-13 of the Illinois
Municipal Code  (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, §§ 1-1 et seq.). Upon payment of the cost

notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the municipality
or person whose name the lien has been filed and the release may be filed of
record as in the case of filing notice of lien. The owner or occupant shall pay
the cost of preparing and recording the lien and release.

to recover the cost of abatement. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
for each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. Except when
fines and costs are paid by compromise payment as provided in division (B)
below prior to court, the Circuit Clerk shall add to the fine any and all costs
and fees upon an authorized disposition.
   (B)   Compromise payment. In the event the Peotone Police, the Village Code
Enforcement Officer or other designee of the village elect to charge any
individual under a compromise citation as set forth hereinafter, any such
person accused of a violation of this chapter and originally charged under this
section may settle and compromise the claim without a court appearance by

§ 98.02 STATEMENT OF VALUE.
   Specific goals of this section are to:
   (A)   Protect, preserve and enhance the quality of life and general welfare
of the village, its residents, and property owners; and conserve and enhance
the village's natural, physical and aesthetic environment.
   (B)   Preserve, protect, and enhance the urban forest to ensure that trees
are properly planted and maintained within the village so that trees can
protect, enhance and preserve the quality of life for people within the
village.
   (C)   Recognize that trees are an integral part of the infrastructure of the
village and as such should be preserved, protected, and cared for as other
critical the village infrastructure.
      (1)   Trees absorb pollution from the air;
      (2)   Trees absorb and sequester carbon dioxide;
      (3)   Trees absorb and filter pollution from stormwater run-off;
      (4)   Trees produce oxygen;
      (5)   Trees reduce flooding;
      (6)   Trees stabilize soils and reduce erosion;
      (7)   Trees cool the surrounding area helping to reduce impacts due to
heat islands;
      (8)   Trees reduce energy consumption by shielding structures from harsh
winds and sun;
      (9)   Trees provide a buffer and screen against noise, light and
pollution;
      (10)   Trees improve property values;
      (11)   Trees improve commercial district buyer traffic;
      (12)   Areas with trees have lower crime rates;
      (13)   Areas with trees have higher levels of community interaction;

§ 100.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village
rights-of-way and the village as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this chapter, the village intends to exercise its
authority over the rights- of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of
the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to
address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (C)   Facilities subject to this chapter. This chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established
prior to the effective date of this chapter may continue to be maintained,
repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located,
except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or
similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village
rights-of- way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this chapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This chapter supersedes all chapters or
parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this chapter when the village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

application review period and the construction period authorized by the permit,
any amendments to information contained in a permit application shall be
submitted by the utility in writing to the village within 30 days after the
change necessitating the amendment.
   (F)   Application fees. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or
similar agreement, all applications for permits pursuant to this chapter shall
be accompanied by a fee in the amount of $250. No application fee is required
to be paid by any electricity utility that is paying the municipal electricity
infrastructure maintenance fee pursuant to the Electricity Infrastructure
Maintenance Fee Act.
   (G)   Permit exemptions. The permit requirements set forth herein shall not
apply to officers or employees of the Village of Peotone engaged in doing work
for the village, to persons or corporations doing work for the village under
contract, or to persons or corporations which are operating under a franchise

§ 100.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village review of permit applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the Village
Engineer and/or the Manager of Streets and Alleys within a reasonable time
after filing. If the application does not conform to the requirements of
applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Manager of
Streets and Alleys shall reject such application in writing, stating the
reasons therefor. If the Manager of Streets and Alleys is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Manager of Streets and
Alleys shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances,
it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of
the Manager of Streets and Alleys, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Additional village review of applications of telecommunications
retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220,
Act 65, § 4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the village that it
intends to commence work governed by this chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than 30 days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Manager of Streets and Alleys
shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Manager of Streets and Alleys fails to
provide such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer
within either (i) ten days after service of notice to the village by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction; or (ii) 25 days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this chapter.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to §
100.04 of this chapter, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of division (A) of this
section.
   (C)   Additional village review of applications of holders of state
authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a state-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted 45 days after
submission to the village, unless otherwise acted upon by the village, provided
the holder has complied with applicable village codes, ordinances, and
regulations.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a
period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with
such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after
the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with §
100.21 of this chapter. If the village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.08 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and, underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of $1,000,000 for personal injury and property damage for
each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than
$1,000,000 per employee and per accident.
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and
subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors
shall comply with this section.
   (B)   Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the village.
   (D)   Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village Administrator of such intent to
cancel or not to renew."
Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event
later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and
furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by division (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under division (A), or the requirements of divisions (B), (C) and (D)
of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under division (A) of
this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer"
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self- insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.10 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this
chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this division shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if
the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial,
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village
Administrator may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this division (C) for any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this division, may withdraw an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14 day
notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the
village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the
permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in division
(C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required
in division (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether
reserved by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)

reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this chapter;
      (3)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (B)   Notice of revocation or suspension. The village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this §

   (C)   Permittee alternatives upon receipt of notice of revocation or
suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the village providing written proof of such removal to
the village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
The village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this division.
   (D)   Stop work order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within division (A) of
this section.
   (E)   Failure or refusal of the permittee to comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of division (C) of this section, the village or
its designee may, at the option of the village: (i) correct the deficiencies;
(ii) upon not less than 20 days notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or (iii) after not less than 30 days notice to the
permittee of failure to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and
property of the village. The permittee shall be liable in all events to the
village for all costs of removal.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (A)   Notification of change. A utility shall notify the village no less
than 30 days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the right-
of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility or
the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules
and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (B)   Amended permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the village's right-
of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.13 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Standards and principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall

(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division.
      (1)   No interference with village facilities. No utility facilities
shall be placed in any location if the Manager of Streets and Alleys determines
that the proposed location will require the relocation or displacement of any
of the village's utility facilities or will otherwise interfere with the
operation or maintenance of any of the village's utility facilities.
Underground utilities may not be placed on the same side of the road as a
public water main.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin said right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are to be mounted between the
curb and the street side of the sidewalk and as remote as practicable from the
curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the curb,
where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are to be mounted between the
pavement and the street side of the sidewalk and as remote from pavement edge
as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the outer
shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway, in the
sidewalk, or in any area designated for a future sidewalk; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground parallel facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line;
         (b)   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near the right-of-way line as practicable and not
more than five feet (1.5 m) from the right-of-way line and any above-grounded
appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line
or as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of village highways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadbed
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Cattle passes, culverts, or drainage facilities. Crossing
facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or drainage
facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at

line of the highway and outside of the clear zone; and
         (c)   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a highway only if:
         (a)   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         (b)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. § 192.707
(1989)).
   (D)   Facilities to be located within particular rights-of-way. The village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way that are
not highways, rather than within particular highways.
   (E)   Freestanding facilities.
      (1)   The village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.
   (F)   Facilities installed above ground. Above ground facilities may be
installed only if:
      (1)   No other existing facilities in the area are located underground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible; and

employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         (d)   The proposed method of attachment;
         (e)   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         (f)   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         (g)   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         (h)   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.
   (H)   Appearance standards.
      (1)   The village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.

permission is obtained from the Manager of Streets and Alleys.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The utility shall not trench within the drip
line of any tree designated by the village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's "Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction." When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the utility shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Manager of Streets and Alleys, the utility, at its expense,
shall remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed
facility, place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new
pavement, sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by
the Manager of Streets and Alleys.

as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 or CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Manager of Streets and Alleys.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the village.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the

by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
village.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the village. Bell and spigot type
pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if:
(1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
(2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

electric utility shall conduct all tree-trimming and vegetation control
activities in the right-of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the village as permitted by law.
   (B)   Other utilities - Tree trimming permit required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered a normal maintenance operation, but
shall require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition
to any other permit required under this chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen trees or trees of special significance. The village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

§ 100.18 REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the village, a
utility shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently
disconnect, remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility
facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably
necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any
village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon,
the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the rights-of-way shall,
at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances
from the rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in
the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;

of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   (C)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate
or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If
circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if
known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if
known, after cutting or removing a facility.
   (D)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the
rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within 90
days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to
remove all or any portion of the facility if the Manager of Streets and Alleys
determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health,
safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility
that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to
the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the
alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility
or person.
(Ord. 07-36, passed 1-14-08)
§ 100.19 CLEAN-UP AND RESTORATION.

within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in a manner
satisfactory to the village and at the utility's expense.
   (B)   Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify non-
compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:
      (1)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Manager of Streets and Alleys or his or her duly authorized agent of the
emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection
of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary
repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free
movement of traffic, the village police shall be notified immediately.
      (3)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to
complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to
the traveling public.
   (C)   Emergency repairs. The utility must file in writing with the village a

Streets and Alleys as a part of the permit application. The request shall
identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and
the reasons why a variance should be granted.
   (B)   Authority to grant variances. The Manager of Streets and Alleys shall
decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter
identified in the variance request on an individual basis.
   (C)   Conditions for granting of variance. The Manager of Streets and Alleys
may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has
demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (D)   Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Manager of Streets and Alleys may require the
utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions
that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry
out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement,
decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the Manager
of Streets and Alleys under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right
to appeal to the Village Board or such other board or commission as it may
designate. The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the
Village Clerk within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement,
decision or determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration
of the appeal at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at
least seven days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely
decide the appeal.

   (A)   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to
comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when
the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and
this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
   (B)   In the event the Peotone Police, the Village Code Enforcement Officer
or other designee of the village elects to charge a person with a violation of
a provision of this chapter under a compromise citation, the person charged may
settle and compromise the claim without a court appearance by payment of one-
half of the minimum required fine to the Village Clerk of the Village Hall
within ten business days of the date of the violation if the compromise box
designation is so checked on the "Complaint and Notice to Appear" form.

removal of such small wireless facilities both within the public rights-of-way
and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the village so as to, among
other things:
   (A)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located both within public
rights-of-way and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the village;
   (B)   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which such small
wireless facilities are installed;
   (C)   Minimize any adverse visual impact of small wireless facilities and
prevent visual blight in the neighborhoods in which such facilities are
installed;
   (D)   Ensure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to small wireless facilities;
   (E)   Provide appropriate aesthetic protections to any designated historic
landmarks or districts within the village; and
   (F)   Ensure that the placement of small wireless facilities does not

shall be allowed if the collocations each involve substantially the same type
of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. Each
consolidated application shall provide all the information required by this
chapter for each small wireless facility at each location. If such an
application includes incomplete information for one or more small wireless
facility collocations, or includes requests for small wireless facilities that
do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or that are otherwise denied, the
village may remove such collocation requests from the application and treat
them as separate requests. Separate permits may be issued for each collocation
approved in a consolidated application.
   (K)   Alternate locations. If an applicant is seeking to install a new
utility pole as part of its application, the village may propose that the small
wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing wireless
support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. The applicant
shall accept the proposed alternate location so long as it has the right to use
the location on reasonable terms and conditions, unless the alternate location
imposes technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the
applicant. If the applicant refuses an alternate location based on the
foregoing, the applicant shall provide legally competent evidence in the form
of a written certification, under oath, describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons that prevent the alternate location
from being utilized.

licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such
interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own
expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the
interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless
facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the
abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973
and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to establish the good faith
effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the
village all information necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the
interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited
above. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a
public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the
procedures for abatement of such nuisances set forth in this code.
   (B)   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small wireless
facility that:
      (1)   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on
a right-of-way;

Chapter 100 (Construction of Utility Facilities in the Rights-of-Way) of this
code, to allow a small wireless facility to be located above ground in an area
where village ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground
facilities if, in addition to demonstrating the conditions of §
100.21 have been established, the wireless provider can establish that:
         (a)   Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is
no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-
way;
         (b)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;
         (c)   An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location
will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or constitute a safety
hazard;

of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan.
      (4)   Future undergrounding. The village may, from time to time, make a
decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type
generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of
the village. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small
wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the village shall
either:
         (a)   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a
reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of
the small wireless facility; or
         (b)   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a
reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole
so it can maintain service from that location.
   (F)   Collocation limits.
      (1)   Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on
village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission
system, within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric

pursuant to this code, in addition to the stealth, concealment and design
requirements referenced above, the following additional restrictions/conditions
apply to the installation of small wireless facilities:
      (1)   Small wireless facilities shall be comprised of materials that are

be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size
restrictions of a small wireless facility.
      (2)   This section shall not be construed to limit the village's
enforcement of historic preservation in conformance with the requirements
adopted pursuant to the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation
Act or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 54 U.S.C. §§ 300101 et
seq., and the regulations adopted to implement those laws.

remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written
notice from the village notifying it of the abandonment. The notice shall be
sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the village

(Ord. 18-05, passed 7-23-18)
§ 101.17 INDEMNIFICATION.
   Other than for liabilities and losses due to or caused by the sole
negligence of the village or its employees or agents, a wireless provider shall

whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the village infrastructure or
improvements, or right-of-way associated with such infrastructure or
improvements by the wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors
arising out of the rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the
act. A wireless provider proceeding under this chapter waives any claims it may

§ 101.18 INSURANCE.

general liability policy to the village prior to the collocation of any small
wireless facility, and shall keep updated certificates and proof of inclusion
on file with the village at all times that the provider maintains small
wireless facilities within the village.
   (C)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limits required by the village. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement that the village be named an additional insured. A wireless
provider that self-insures shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to
demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance limits required
by the village.

corrected within such period, the village reserves the right to take such
action as it deems necessary, including revocation of the permit. Maintenance
and replacement of small wireless facilities shall be performed by the wireless
provider at the wireless provider's sole cost and expense.
   (B)   In the event of an emergency involving an imminent threat to life or

misrepresentation of a material fact with respect to the permit application, or

      (2)   The wireless provider failed to construct the small wireless
facility in accordance with the approved plans;
      (3)   The wireless provider failed to comply within any material

      (5)   The wireless provider failed to notify the village of the
replacement of small wireless facilities as required by this chapter;

setting forth the basis for the revocation. The wireless provider shall, within
14 days of the notice of revocation, file a written response with the Manager
of Streets and Alleys or his or her designee setting forth the reasons why the
permit should not be revoked along with such evidence in opposition to the
revocation as the wireless provider determines necessary. Failure to file a
response with the Manager of Streets and Alleys or his or her designee shall be
deemed an admission of the facts set forth in the notification of written
notification and shall result in automatic revocation of the permit. The
Manager of Streets and Alleys or his or her designee shall render findings and
a decision within 21 days of the date of receipt of the wireless provider's
response, if any.
   (C)   If the Manager of Streets and Alleys or his or her designee revokes

§ 112.22 TRANSFER OF LICENSE; RENEWALS.
   (A)    Transfers.
      (1)    Personal privilege. A license shall be purely a personal
privilege, good for and not to exceed one year after issuance unless revoked
sooner as in this chapter provided and shall not constitute property, nor shall
it be subject to attachment, garnishment, or execution, nor shall it be
alienable or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being
encumbered or hypothecated; subject, however, to exceptions hereinafter
provided in this section.
      (2)   No vested right. Nothing contained in this chapter or section shall
create any vested or property right in any liquor license in any person
whatsoever, nor shall it limit or restrict the right of the village to at any
time amend or repeal this chapter.
      (3)   Death or bankruptcy. A license shall cease upon the death,
insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensee or, when issued to a partnership, the
death of a partner of a licensee, and shall not descend by the laws of testate
or intestate devolution, provided that executors or administrators of the
estate of any deceased licensee or partner of a licensee, and the trustee of
any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in part of
alcoholic liquor may, upon written notice to the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner, continue the business of the sale of alcoholic liquor under the
order of the appropriate court, and may exercise the privileges of the deceased
or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of decedent, or such
insolvency, or bankruptcy until the expiration of such license, but not longer
than six months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee or
partner of a licensee. If a corporation to whom a license has been issued is
ordered into receivership or files for bankruptcy, the receiver or trustee may
continue the operation of the business under the existing license under order
of the appropriate court until the expiration of such license, but not longer
than six months after the date of appointment of a receiver or trustee,
whichever comes first. At the time of expiration of the license or passage of
six months following death, bankruptcy or appointment of a receiver or trustee
as specified in this division, the liquor license shall automatically terminate
and the number of available licenses in that classification shall automatically
and immediately be reduced by one.
      (4)   Changes in ownership.
         (a)   When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or
a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock
exchange, the license shall terminate whenever 50% or more of the ownership
interest therein changes from that shown on the original license application,
except as provided for in this division. Prior to a transfer of 50% or more of
the ownership, the partnership, limited liability company or corporation,
through its officers/ members/partners, shall submit a complete application and
the required fees for the issuance of a new license, as provided herein, and
said application is subject to approval by the Board of Trustees and the local
Liquor Control Commissioner, in their sole discretion, and such approval is
necessary for the new ownership to sell and/or serve alcoholic beverages. In
the event that the transfer of ownership occurs prior to the approval of the
application, the new corporate ownership shall be prohibited from selling and/
or serving alcoholic beverages at the applied for location until the
application is approved by the Board of Trustees and the local Liquor Control
Commissioner and all required fees for the liquor license have been paid to the
village.
         (b)   When the licensee is a corporation whose stock is publicly
traded on a recognized stock exchange, the license shall automatically
terminate whenever 50% or more of the membership of the Board of Directors of
the corporation changes from that shown on the original license application, or
whenever one person who was not shown as an owner of 50% or more of the
ownership interest in the publicly traded corporation at the time of the
original liquor license application, becomes an owner of a 50% or more
ownership interest in the publicly traded corporation. In such event, the
corporation, through its officers/board of directors, must make application for
the issuance of a new license as provided in this chapter.
         (c)   When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or
corporation, no change in ownership from that shown on the original application
involving the addition of a new partner or member of such partnership or
limited liability company or a new shareholder who will own in the aggregate
more than 5% of the stock of such corporation shall be effective until such
proposed change in ownership has first been reported in writing to the Local
Liquor Control Commissioner and the Commissioner finds that the proposed new
partner(s) or shareholder(s) is/are not ineligible under the provisions of this
chapter and so advises the licensee in writing. Any change in ownership without
complying with the terms hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the
suspension or revocation of the liquor license issued to such partnership or
corporation.
         (d)   When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or
corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange,
no change in ownership from that shown on the original application involving
the withdrawal of any partner, manager or shareholder shall be made without
reporting such change in ownership in writing to the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner within ten days of any such change in ownership. Any such change
in ownership made without complying with the terms hereof shall constitute
grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or revocation of the liquor license
issued to such partnership, limited liability company or corporation.
      (5)   Termination upon transfer. Upon the alienation, sale, transfer,
assignment or donation of the business that underlies the license to any third
party or person other than the licensee or as otherwise authorized by this
section, the liquor license shall automatically terminate and the number of
available licenses in that classification shall automatically and immediately
be reduced by one.
      (6)    Refunds. A refund shall be made of that portion of the license
fees paid for any period in which the licensee shall be prevented from
operating under such license in accordance with the provisions of this
division.
   (B)   Renewals. Any licensee may renew his license at the expiration thereof
by submitting a renewal application, provided he or she is then qualified to
receive a license and the premises for which such renewal license is sought are
suitable for such purpose; provided that the renewal privilege herein provided
for shall not be construed as a vested right which shall in any case prevent
the Village President from decreasing the number of licenses to be issued
within his or her jurisdiction. A renewal application that is not timely filed
at least 30 days prior to the license renewal date of May 1 each year shall
include, in addition to the annual liquor license fee, a late fee of $250.

   (A)   No licensee, holding a retail liquor dealer's license in the village,
nor any officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of such
licensee, shall sell, give, or deliver alcoholic liquor to any person under the
age of 21 years, or to any intoxicated person or to any person known by him to
be a habitual drunkard, spendthrift, insane, mentally ill, mentally deficient,
or in need of mental treatment. No person, after purchasing or otherwise
obtaining alcoholic liquor shall give it to another person under the age of 21
years, except in the performance of a religious ceremony or service.
('70 Code, § 9.18.1)
   (B)   Any person to whom the sale, gift, or delivery of alcoholic liquor is
prohibited because of age shall not purchase, or accept a gift of alcoholic
liquor or have alcoholic liquor in his possession. If a licensee or his agents
or employees believes or has reason to believe that a sale or delivery of
alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of the nonage of the prospective
recipient, shall, before making such sale or delivery, demand presentation of
some form of positive identification, containing proof of age, issued by a
public officer in the performance of his official duties.
('70 Code, § 9.18.2)
   (C)   No person under the age of 21 years, shall possess, or consume any
alcoholic liquor.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian to permit his or her
residence to be used by an invitee of the parent's child or the guardian's
ward, if the invitee is under the age of 21, in a manner that constitutes a
violation of any provision of the Village Code of Peotone's Alcoholic Liquor
Ordinance (§§
112.01 et seq.) A parent or guardian is deemed to have permitted his or her
residence to be used in violation of this section if he or she knowingly
authorizes, enables, or permits such use to occur by failing to limit access to
either the residence or the alcoholic liquor maintained in the residence.
Nothing in this §
112.39(D) shall be construed to prohibit the giving of an alcoholic liquor to a
person under the age of 21 in the performance of a religious ceremony or
service.
   (E)   Any person shall be guilty of an offense where he or she knowingly
permits a gathering at a residence which he or she occupies of two or more of
the persons where any one or more of the persons is under 21 years of age and
the following factors apply:
      (1)   The person occupying the residence knows that any such person under
the age of 21 is in possession of or is consuming any alcoholic beverage; and
      (2)   The possession or consumption of the alcohol by the person under 21
is not otherwise permitted by Illinois law or ordinance; and
      (3)   The person occupying the residence knows that the person under the
age of 21 leaves the residence in an intoxicated condition. For purposes of
this division (E), where the residence has an owner and a tenant or lessee,
there is a rebuttable presumption that the residence is occupied only by the
tenant or lessee.
   (F)   Any person who rents a hotel or motel room from the proprietor or
agent thereof for the purpose of or with the knowledge that such room shall be
used for the consumption of alcoholic liquor by persons under the age of 21
shall be guilty of an offense.
   (G)   Except as otherwise provided by the Illinois law, any person who has
an alcoholic liquor in his or her possession on public school district property
on school days or at any events on public school property when the children are
present is guilty of an offense, unless the alcoholic liquor (i) is in the
original container with the seal unbroken and is in the possession of a person
who is not otherwise legally prohibited from possessing the alcoholic liquor or
(ii) is in the possession of a person in or for the performance of a religious
service or ceremony authorized by the School Board.

business to consummate the sale of alcoholic liquor except at a counter with a
cash register designated to be used for sale of alcoholic liquor and which cash

§ 112.46 OUTDOOR OR ACCESSORY PREMISES.
   Any lawfully issued license that allows for the use of any accessory
premises for the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor outdoor or in a "beer
garden" or other portion of a property that is covered by the said license
shall require that such outdoor sales and/or consumption shall at all times
comply with the following:
   (A)   The licensee shall keep and maintain the accessory premises in a
clean, safe and sanitary condition and in compliance with all accessibility
standards. The licensee shall not keep or maintain the accessory premises in
such a manner so as to constitute a public or private nuisance.
   (B)   The licensee shall collect and properly dispose of litter and garbage
situated upon the accessory premises. The licensee shall also collect and
properly dispose of litter and garbage from adjacent public property and
adjacent private property, with the permission of the owner thereof, that the
licensee has reason to believe originated from the licensed or accessory
premises. The licensee shall have an affirmative obligation to periodically
supervise and patrol the accessory premises at reasonable intervals to
ascertain whether there exists litter and garbage requiring collection and
disposal. This duty shall include, but shall not be limited to, making lawful
observations of adjacent public and private property.
   (C)   The licensee shall, with due diligence, take reasonable measures to
prevent audio systems operated by persons located within the accessory premises
from being audible beyond the boundaries of the property containing the
accessory premises. The licensee shall have the affirmative obligation to
periodically supervise and patrol the accessory premises at reasonable
intervals to enforce this requirement. The licensee shall be deemed to have
failed to periodically supervise the accessory premises at reasonable intervals
if an audio system operated by a person located within the accessory premises
is audible beyond the boundaries thereof for a period in excess of 15
consecutive minutes. In the event the licensee discovers, or is notified by a
law enforcement officer or a third party, that an audio system is audible
beyond the boundaries of the property containing the accessory premises, the
licensee shall promptly and lawfully remove the offending vehicle and its
occupants from the accessory premises and shall, for at least that business
day, deny such persons entry to the licensed premises.
   (D)   The licensee shall take reasonable measures to prevent the consumption
of alcoholic liquor upon the accessory premises, unless such consumption is
otherwise specifically permitted by license or ordinance. This shall include,
but shall not be limited to, the prompt and lawful removal from the accessory
premises of persons observed by the licensee consuming alcoholic liquor, or
possessing open or unsealed containers thereof, whether or not such containers
are empty. The licensee shall also deny such persons entry to the licensed
premises for at least that business day. The licensee shall have the
affirmative obligation to periodically supervise and patrol the accessory
premises at reasonable intervals to enforce this requirement.
   (E)   A licensee may apply, in writing, to the office of the Village
Administrator for permission to hold one event per year not to exceed 72 hours
in duration when live music may be played outdoors on the licensed premises. No
such live music may be played between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 11:00 a.m.
and the Village Administrator may attach such other conditions to the permit as
may be advisable to protect the peace and quiet of the surrounding area.
Further, the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, the Village Administrator or
his designate of either, shall have the absolute right, for cause and without
the necessity of a hearing, to order the immediate cessation of such live
music. Uniformed police officers may be required for certain events.
   (F)   Nothing contained in this chapter, or under the terms of §
112.47(E) above, shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of the
Liquor Commissioner to grant special event licenses to the Will County Fair
Association which said licenses may be granted for more than one event per
year, and/or in excess of 72 hours.
(Ord. 07-39, passed 1-28-08)
§ 112.47 REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS.
   The licensee shall immediately report to the Village Police Department all
acts of disorderly conduct, battery, assault, fighting, indecent exposure,
criminal damage to property, unlawful loitering, public urination or other
violation of federal, state or local law, that the licensee observes or has
reason to believe is occurring or has occurred upon the licensed premises, the
accessory premises or public property adjacent to the licensed or accessory
premises. The licensee shall cooperate with any law enforcement agency in the
investigation and prosecution of such violations.

violation of any provision of the Village Code of Peotone’s Alcoholic Liquor
Ordinance (§§ 112.01 et seq.) A parent or guardian is deemed to have permitted
his or her residence to be used in violation of this section if he or she
knowingly authorizes, enables, or permits such use to occur by failing to limit
access to either the residence or the alcoholic liquor maintained in the

permits a gathering at a residence which he or she occupies of two or more of

the age of 21 is in possession of or is consuming any alcoholic beverage; and
      (2)   The possession or consumption of the alcohol by the person under 21
is not otherwise permitted by Illinois law or ordinance; and
      (3)   The person occupying the residence knows that the person under the
age of 21 leaves the residence in an intoxicated condition.
For purposes of this division (E), where the residence has an owner and a

§ 119.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.
   (A)   The President and Village Board of Trustees expressly find and declare
that cigarette smoking is dangerous to human health; and
   (B)   There exists substantial scientific evidence that the use of tobacco
products causes cancer, heart disease and various other medical disorders; and
   (C)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that nicotine
addiction from tobacco is similar to addiction to cocaine, and is the most
widespread example of drug dependence in this country; and
   (D)   The Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that
the majority of the 320,000 Americans who die each year from cigarette smoking
became addicted to nicotine as adolescents before the age of legal consent; and
   (E)   The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cigarette smoking
precedes and may be predictive of adolescent illicit drug use; and
   (F)   The present legislative scheme of prohibiting sales of tobacco
products to persons under the age of 18 has proven ineffective in preventing
such persons from using tobacco products; and
   (G)   The establishment of the regulations embodied in this Chapter 119
directly pertains to and is in furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of
the residents of the village, particularly those residents under 18 years of
age.

§ 150.068 SIDEWALK ESCROW.
   (A)   No building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel in the
village until such time as the applicant has deposited the sum of $15 per
frontage foot to insure that a sidewalk is constructed on the subject property
in full compliance with the regulations of the village. Such deposit shall be
by cashier's check or in cash. At the time of receipt, such sidewalk escrow
amount shall be deposited in a separate fund to be known as the sidewalk escrow
fund and in a separate interest-bearing bank account. After any required
sidewalk has been completed as required, and upon acceptance of the same by the
Administrator, the Village Clerk will then refund to the applicant, without
interest, the applicable amount in said sidewalk escrow fund. If such sidewalk
is not constructed in full compliance with the regulations of the village, and
the applicant has failed to bring it into full compliance within 30 days after
written notice from the village to do so, the village will then be entitled to
use said sidewalk escrow amount for constructing and/or completing the required
sidewalk in accordance with all village regulations. Once the sidewalk has been
completed, the amount, if any, not including interest, remaining in said
sidewalk escrow fund will be returned to the applicant. If the village is
required to construct or complete the sidewalk and the cost of such completion
or construction of the sidewalk exceeds the amount in the sidewalk escrow fund,
then the applicant shall be required to pay to the village the amount by which
the actual cost of construction exceeds the amount in the sidewalk escrow fund.
   (B)   It shall be responsibility of the applicant to request a refund of the
sidewalk escrow fund amount, and if no such request is received within three
years from the date the deposit was made, then the village shall be entitled to
use any amount remaining in said sidewalk escrow fund for general corporate
purposes.
(Ord. 05-05, passed 4-18-05)
§ 150.069 OCCUPANCY PERMIT ESCROW.
   (A)   No building permit shall be issued for any lot or parcel in the
village until such time as the applicant has deposited the sum required by this
section for an occupancy permit to insure that an occupancy permit is issued on
the subject property after full compliance with the regulations of the village.
The amount of the deposit shall be $1,000 for each nonresidential building, and
$500 per dwelling unit in residential buildings. Such deposit shall be by check
or in cash. At the time of receipt, the occupancy permit escrow amount shall be
deposited in a separate fund to be known as the occupancy permit escrow fund
and in a separate interest-bearing bank account.
   (B)   At such time when the final inspection has been made of the subject
property and if all requirements of the village have been met, the Building
Administrator shall issue an occupancy permit. The Village Collector, upon
notification by the Building Administrator, will then refund to the applicant,
without interest, the amount of the appropriate occupancy permit escrow fund.
Such amount shall not be returned to the applicant until such time as the
Building Administrator certifies in writing that all requirements have been
met. If any building or unit is not in full compliance with the regulations of
the village, and the applicant has failed to bring it into full compliance
within 30 days after written notice from the village to do so, the occupancy
permit escrow shall be forfeited to the village.
   (C)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to request a refund of
the occupancy permit escrow fund amount, and if no such request is received
within three years from the date the deposit was made, then the village shall
be entitled to use any amount remaining in said occupancy permit escrow fund
for general corporate purposes.
   (D)   Occupation of any building or unit prior to the issuance of an
occupancy certificate by the Building Administrator, shall result in the
following:
      (1)   Total deposit monies herein shall be forfeited to the village.
      (2)   Upon notice and appropriate hearing as otherwise provided in this
code, the village will immediately turn off the water service to the property
and service shall not be resumed until such time as the village issues an
occupancy permit.
   (3)   The penalties set forth in §
150.999 shall apply, including monetary penalties and barring, for a set period
of time, the issuance of building permits to contractors in violation.

§ 150.070 SPECIAL CONSULTANTS REVIEW ESCROW.
   (A)   Whenever the review of a particular building permit, because of
special circumstances, requires review by outside consultants to be hired by
the village, such reviews will not be contracted for by the village until such
time as the applicant has deposited a sum sufficient to pay the full cost of
the consultants' services. The village will seek estimates of the cost of the
reviews from each of the consultants and notify the applicant of such
estimates. The applicant shall then deposit an amount equal to 110% of such
estimates into escrow with the village. Such deposit shall be by check or in
cash. At the time of receipt, the escrow amount shall be deposited in a
separate fund to be known as the consultant review escrow fund and in a
separate interest-bearing bank account subject to itemized verification of
expenditures made. The village will then draw amounts from said escrow deposit
to pay for the services of the consultants at such time as their bills are
submitted and become due and payable. If at any time the deposit, after such
draws, becomes less than 25% of the original deposit, then the applicant shall
deposit additional funds in an amount to be determined by the village, which
additional deposit shall increase the amount in the escrow account to an amount
sufficient to pay all remaining fees anticipated to be owed to the consultants.
If the amount on deposit ever is determined by the village to be insufficient
to pay for all remaining services for the consultants, or if the applicant ever
fails or refuses to make any required additional deposits, then all reviews by
the consultants shall cease until any required additional deposit is made and
the applicant will not be entitled to any continued review of his or her
application until the additional deposit is made. Once the reviews by the
consultants have been completed and they have been fully paid for their
services, then any remaining amount on deposit, less any interest income, shall
be refunded to the applicant. The interest income shall be retained by the
village to help pay for the administrative costs of the village.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to request a refund of
the escrow fund amount and, if no such request is received within three years
from the date the deposit was made, then the village shall be entitled to use
any amount remaining in said escrow fund for general corporate purposes.
   (C)   Occupation of any building or unit prior to the issuance of an
occupancy certificate by the Building Administrator shall result in the
following:
      (1)   Total deposit monies herein shall be forfeited to the village.
      (2)   Upon notice and appropriate hearing as otherwise provided in this
code, the village will immediately turn off the water service to the property
and service shall not be resumed until such time as the village issues an
occupancy permit.
      (3)   The penalties set forth in §
150.999 shall apply, including monetary penalties and barring, for a set period
of time, the issuance of building permits to contractors in violation.

§ 151.004 REFERENCE TO WATERSHED PLANS.
   (A)   This chapter recognizes the integrated nature of the watershed system
and the need to study certain flood control alternatives and other stormwater
management functions on a watershed-wide basis. A generalized process for
development of watershed plans was recommended in the adopted “County
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.” This process includes a public
hearing review and approval by the Committee, and adoption by the county.
   (B)   (1)   Individual watershed plans or interim watershed plans which
recognize the unique attributes of each watershed may be prepared and
periodically updated for the major watersheds, to identify management projects
and establish criteria for development. These plans may also recommend changes
to this chapter effective within the study boundary.
      (2)   Watershed plans or interim watershed plans may be adopted which
recommend more or less stringent criteria than the criteria in this chapter.
When adopted by the County Board, these watershed-specific criteria established
in watershed plans or interim watershed plans shall be set forth as §§
151.035 through
151.047 of this chapter.

request that a fee-in-lieu of detention be approved provided that all of the
following are demonstrated to the sole satisfaction of the Administrator:
            1.   The drainage plan will not increase existing flood damages;
and
            2.   The drainage plan provides a net benefit in water quality
compared to the existing development.
      (2)   The Administrator shall determine the appropriate fee to be
collected as defined in §

(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.021 GENERAL STORMWATER REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Requirements applicable to all developments. No development shall:
      (1)   Result in any new or additional expense to any person other than
the developer for flood protection; or
      (2)   Increase flood elevations or decrease flood conveyance capacity
upstream or downstream of the area under the ownership or control of the
developer. This requirement shall not prohibit the removal or reduction of
built obstructions to flow, such as increasing culvert capacity or lowering
roadway elevations.
   (B)   Building permits. Stormwater facilities shall be functional before
building permits are issued for residential and nonresidential subdivision.
   (C)   Single parcel developments. Stormwater facilities shall be functional
where practicable for single parcel developments before building construction
begins.
   (D)   Overland flow paths. The development shall have an overland flow path
at the downstream limit of the property that will pass the base flood flow
without increasing damage to structures or property. If the upstream drainage
area is less than 20 acres, the storm sewer pipe and inlet sized for the base
flood can be constructed in lieu of providing an overland flow path. Overland
flow paths internal to the site shall be considered as part of the major
stormwater system and shall be designed for conveyance of the base flood
(critical duration) and shall be a minimum of one cfs per tributary acre
without damage to structures.
   (E)   Protection of buildings. All usable space in new buildings or added to
existing buildings hydraulically connected to a major stormwater system, site
runoff storage facility or overland flow path shall be elevated, floodproofed
or otherwise protected to at least one foot above the 100-year design elevation
or current FIS elevation, whichever is greater, The design elevation is the
elevation associated with the design release rate as determined in §
151.022(C).
   (F)   Depressional storage. The function of existing on-site depressional
storage shall be preserved for both on-site and off-site tributary flows in
addition to required detention. When depressional storage is removed it must be
compensated for in the site runoff storage facility at a one to one ratio
provided that offsite areas tributary to the existing depressional storage are
routed through the site runoff storage facility. This requirement is in
addition to the site runoff storage required in §
151.022. The Administrator may allow the function of depressional storage to be
preserved if the applicant performs detailed pre- and post-project hydrologic
and hydraulic modeling to identify the effect of the depressional storage on
discharges over a range of rainfall frequencies.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.022 SITE RUNOFF REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Stormwater facility discharges. Stormwater facilities shall be
required and designed so that runoff exits the site at a point where it existed
prior to the subject development and in a manner so that flows will not
increase flood damage to adjacent property except when otherwise approved by
the Administrator. Concentrated discharges from new developments must enter
conveyance systems capable of carrying the design flow rate without increasing
flood damages or maintenance costs downstream.
   (B)   Minor stormwater system criteria. Minor stormwater systems shall be
sized to convey runoff from the tributary watershed under fully developed
conditions consistent with the design requirements of the local jurisdiction.
   (C)   Major stormwater system criteria. Major stormwater systems shall be
sized to carry the base flood without causing additional flood damage.
   (D)   Existing subsurface and surface drainage systems.
      (1)   Stormwater systems shall properly incorporate and be compatible
with existing subsurface and surface drainage systems including agricultural
systems. Designs shall not cause damage to the existing drainage system(s) or
the existing adjacent or tributary land including those with agricultural uses.
      (2)   The following principles and requirements shall be observed in the
design.
         (a)   Off-site outfall. Agricultural subsurface and surface drainage
systems shall be evaluated regarding their capacity and capability to properly
convey low flow ground water and site runoff storage facility release without
damage to downstream structure and land use on the adjacent property. If the
outfall drain tile and surface drainage systems prove to be inadequate, it will
be necessary to modify the existing systems or construct new systems which will
not conflict with the existing systems and will not impact the existing
agricultural land use. Existing subsurface systems shall only be used with
extended detention design.
         (b)   On-site. Agricultural drainage systems shall be located and
evaluated on-site. All existing on-site agricultural drain tile not serving a
beneficial use shall be abandoned by trench removal prior to other development
and recorded on record plans. If any existing drain tiles continue to upland
watersheds, the developer must maintain drainage service during construction
until new sewers can be installed for a permanent connection.
         (c)   Off-site tributary. Existing drainage systems shall be evaluated
with regard to existing capabilities and reasonable future expansion
capacities. All existing tributary drain tiles shall be incorporated into the
new conduits including observation structures located at the property limits,
shall provide a free flow discharge and shall not allow surface runoff to enter
the system.
         (d)   New roadway construction. New roadway construction shall
preserve existing subsurface systems within the right-of-way. Inspection wells
shall be placed at the right-of-way (ROW) and tiles found to not be flowing
between inspection wells at the end of the construction shall be replaced.
   (E)   Design runoff rate. Design runoff rates for conveyance may be
calculated using the rational method.
   (F)   Design rainfall. Any design runoff rate calculation method for
conveyance shall use State Water Survey Bulletin 70 based intensity-duration-
frequency curves.
   (G)   Stormwater system easements. For projects involving subdivision major
and minor stormwater systems shall be located within easements or rights-of-way
explicitly providing for public access for maintenance of the facilities. For
all other projects requiring a permit, easements are required for public access
for maintenance of stormwater facilities only for new construction or
modifications involving components of a drainage system that conveys runoff
from off-site properties. For I-2, I-3 or equivalent zoning property, the
stormwater system does not have to be located within an easement or public
rights-of-way. Instead, the owner's representative shall provide a signed
agreement to the appropriate government entity authorizing it to enter the
facility to maintain the stormwater system if the owner fails to correct any
deficiencies brought to the owner's attention by the governmental entity.
   (H)   Flow depths. Maximum flow depths for new transverse stream crossings
shall not exceed one foot at the crown of the road during the base flood
condition. The maximum flow depth on a roadway shall not exceed six inches at
the crown for flow parallel to the roadway. For flow over a new roadway or
parallel to a new roadway, the product of the flow depth (in feet) and velocity
(in feet per second) shall not exceed four for the base flood condition.
   (I)   Diversion of flow to another watershed. Transfers of waters between
watersheds (diversions) shall be prohibited except when the transfers will not
violate the provisions of §
151.021 (A) and are otherwise lawful. Watersheds for purpose of regulation
under this section shall be the major watershed divides as defined in the
County Plan.
   (J)   Best management practices requirement. Developments shall incorporate
all best management practices as may be required pursuant to the United States
Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq,, as amended.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.023 SITE RUNOFF STORAGE REQUIREMENTS (DETENTION/EXTENDED DETENTION).
   (A)   Release rate.
      (1)   If no release rate is specified in an adopted watershed plan in
accordance with §
151.004, then sufficient flood storage shall be provided so that the site will
not discharge at a rate greater than 0.15 cfs/acre of development during and
after a rainfall event with a 100-year frequency except for sites exempted in
this section. Unless exempted in this section, sites shall not discharge at a
rate greater than 0.04 cfs/acre of development during and after a rainfall
event with a two-year frequency.
      (2)   This area of hydrologic disturbance on the site shall be used to
calculate the required site runoff storage volume. The on-site watershed area
tributary to the point of discharge shall be used to calculate the allowable
release rate for the site runoff storage facility, which shall be the maximum
release rate allowed considering only the on-site watershed area runoff.
   (B)   Design methods.
      (1)   Event hydrograph routing methods or the modified rational method
may be used to calculate design runoff volumes for site runoff facilities. The
methods must be HEC-1, (SCS methodology), HEC-HMS, TR-20 or TR-55 tabular
method. Event methods shall incorporate the following assumptions:
         (a)   Antecedent moisture condition equals two;
         (b)   Appropriate Huff rainfall distribution; and
         (c)   Twenty-four-hour duration storm with a 1% probability (100-year
frequency) of occurrence in any one year as specified by the State Water Survey
Bulletin 70 Northeast Sectional rainfall statistics.
      (2)   When the modified rational method is used, rainfall statistics
shall be from the State Water Survey Bulletin 70 and the volume determined
shall be multiplied by the following factor based on the date of final
engineering approval:
         (a)   In the first year after the effective date of the chapter: 110%;
         (b)   In the second year after the effective date of the chapter:
120%; and
         (c)   After the third year following the effective date of the
chapter: 130%.
   (C)   Existing release rate less than allowable. For sites where the
undeveloped release rate is less than the maximum release rate in division (A)
above, the developed release rate and corresponding site runoff storage volume
shall be based on the existing undeveloped release rate for the development.
   (D)   Downstream water surface elevations. All hydrologic and hydraulic
computations must utilize appropriate assumptions for downstream water surface
elevations, from low flow through the base flood elevation, considering the
likelihood of concurrent flood events.
   (E)   Extended detention requirement.
      (1)   The requirements of this section will apply only when an existing
agricultural land use is downstream of and adjacent to a site runoff storage
facility outlet, The runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall event over the
hydraulically connected impervious area of the new development shall be stored
below the elevation of the primary gravity outlet (extended detention) of the
site runoff storage facility. The facility may be designed to allow for
evapotranspiration or infiltration of this volume into a subsurface drainage
system and shall not be conveyed through a direct positive connection to
downstream areas.
      (2)   The hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation
of required extended detention volume may be reduced by the Administrator if
the soils are prepared to maximize infiltration and deep-rooted grasses or
other plants selected for their ability to promote infiltration or water
absorption are planted in areas appropriately dedicated. The reduction in
hydraulically connected impervious area used in the calculation shall be equal
to the area of the development meeting the above soils/native planting
requirement.
      (3)   Subsurface drainage systems may be designed as a component of the
extended detention portion of the detention basin to assist in infiltration in
accordance with the following criteria.
         (a)   The extended detention volume shall be discharged at a rate no
greater than that required to empty the calculated extended detention volume
within five days of the storm event.
         (b)   No subsurface drainage pipe shall be located within ten feet of
drainage pipes directly connected to the detention basin.
         (c)   For purposes of meeting the maximum subsurface drainage
discharge requirements, flow control orifices and weirs may be used.
         (d)   All design extended detention volume shall be provided above the
seasonal high ground water table or the invert elevation of the ground water
control system.
         (e)   Farm field tile shall not be considered a subsurface drainage
system.
   (F)   Site runoff storage facility design requirements. Storage facilities
shall be designed and
constructed with the following characteristics.
      (1)   The site runoff storage facility shall provide one foot of
freeboard above the design high water elevation.
      (2)   The storage facilities shall be accessible and easily maintained.
      (3)   Storage facilities shall facilitate sedimentation and catchment of
floating material. Unless specifically approved by the Administrator, concrete
lined low-flow ditches shall not be used in detention basins.
      (4)   Storage facilities shall minimize impacts of stormwater runoff on
water quality by incorporating best management practices.
      (5)   Storage facilities shall maximize the normal flow distance between
detention inlets and outlets, to the extent possible.

duration rainfall will not be exceeded assuming the primary restrictor is
blocked.
      (7)   Storage facilities with single pipe outlets shall have a minimum
inside diameter of 12 inches. If design release rates necessitate a smaller
outlet, structures such as perforated risers or flow control orifices shall be
used.
   (G)   Site runoff storage facility requirements. Within the regulatory
floodplain storage facilities located within the regulatory floodplain shall:
      (1)   Conform to all applicable requirements specified in §§
151.060 through
151.066 of this chapter;
      (2)   Store the required amount of site runoff to meet the release rate
requirement under all stream flow and backwater conditions in the receiving
stream up to the ten-year flood elevation;
      (3)   Detention volume provided by enlarging existing regulatory
floodplain storage without providing a structure controlling discharge (on-
stream detention) will be allowed only as a variance. The applicant must
demonstrate that flood damages are not increased and the development will not
increase flood flows for both the two-year and 100-year floods on the stream
with developed conditions on the site; and
      (4)   The Administrator may approve designs which can be shown by
detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analysis to provide a net watershed benefit
not otherwise realized by strict application of the requirements in (1) through
(3) above.
   (H)   Site runoff storage facility requirements within the regulatory
floodway. Storage facilities located within the regulatory floodway shall:
      (1)   Meet the requirements for locating storage facilities in the
regulatory floodplain;
      (2)   Be evaluated by performing hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
consistent with the standards and requirements for any adopted watershed plans;
and
      (3)   Provide a net watershed benefit.
   (I)   Off-site facilities. Site runoff storage facilities may be located

subchapter, §§
151.020 through
151.024.
      (2)   Adequate storage capacity in the off-site facility is dedicated to
the development.
      (3)   The development includes means to convey stormwater to the off-site
storage facility.
   (J)   Cross-stream structures for site runoff storage facilities. Structures
constructed across the channel to impound water to meet detention requirements
shall be prohibited on any perennial stream unless part of a public flood
control project with a net watershed benefit. Those streams appearing as blue
on a USGS quadrangle map shall be assumed perennial unless better data is
obtained. All cross-stream structures for the purpose of impounding water to
provide detention in all cases on perennial and intermittent streams must
demonstrate that they will not cause short-term or long-term stream channel
instability.

   (D)   Sediment control for open channels. 
      (1)   All open channel drainage systems shall maintain practices adjacent
to the open outlet channel that will reduce the transportation of sediment off-
site. Runoff from agricultural fields must pass through a sediment control
system prior to discharge into the open channel conveyance system.
      (2)   Approved sediment control systems may consist of the following:
         (a)   Vegetated buffer zones planted with permanent grasses
appropriate for soil stabilization and filtering;
         (b)   Grade control structures for over fall stabilization;
         (c)   Sediment traps adjacent to the stream channel; and
         (d)   Other standard practices for conservation planning in accordance
with the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (current edition) or as otherwise
approved by the County NRCS District Conservationist or the Administrator.
   (E)   Maintenance and construction of drainage systems. Agricultural
drainage systems shall be maintained so as to convey the expected flows for
good drainage practices. The existing agricultural surface drainage systems
shall not be enlarged unless the enlargement is consistent with all other
sections of this section. Maintenance and construction of subsurface drainage
systems will not be subject to the requirements of other sections of this
chapter except as they are regulated by other agencies. Maintenance projects by
legally functioning drainage districts on existing agricultural drainage
systems will not be subject to further permitting requirements under this
chapter except as they relate to the jurisdiction of other agencies.

SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL
§ 151.035 SITE PLANNING.
   (A)   Sediment and erosion control planning shall be part of the initial
site planning process. In planning the development of the site, the applicant
shall consider the susceptibility of existing soils to erosion and topographic
features such as steep slopes and stream corridors which must be protected to
reduce the amount of sediment and erosion which occurs. Where appropriate,
existing vegetation shall be protected from disturbance during construction by
fencing or other means.
   (B)   In the planning process, the applicant shall also address the
following.
      (1)   For projects that involve phased construction, existing land cover
for those areas not under current development shall be addressed. If existing
land cover does not consist of an appropriate ground cover then these phases
shall be planted temporarily to reduce erosion from idle land.
      (2)   In planning the sediment and erosion control strategy, preference
shall be given to reducing erosion rather than controlling sediment. In order
to accomplish this, the plan must carefully consider the construction sequence
of the phases so that the amount of land area exposed to erosive forces is the
minimum consistent with completing construction.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.036 STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   Specifications for erosion control measures shall be in accordance with the
Illinois Urban Manual (1995) or latest edition. Sediment and erosion control
planning shall be in accordance with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil
Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois (revised July 1988) by the Urban
Committee of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts
{'{'}The Green Book) Chapters 1 through 5. Where the Illinois Urban Manual
supercedes sections of The Green Book, the Illinois Urban Manual shall prevail.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.037 GENERAL REQUIREMENT.
   The runoff from disturbed areas shall not leave the development site without
first passing through sediment control facilities. This requirement shall apply
to all phases of construction and shall include an ongoing process of
implementation of measures and maintenance of those measures during both the
construction season and any construction shut down periods.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.038 EXTENDED CONSTRUCTION SHUTDOWN PERIOD.
   The condition of the construction site for the winter shut down period shall
address proper sediment and erosion control early in the fall growing season so
that slopes and other bare earth areas may be stabilized with temporary and/or
permanent vegetative cover. All open areas that are to remain idle throughout
the winter shall receive temporary erosion control measures including temporary
seeding, mulching and/or erosion control blanketing prior to the end of the
fall growing season. The areas to be worked beyond the end of the growing
season must incorporate soil stabilization measures that do not rely on
vegetative cover such as erosion control blankets and heavy mulching.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.039 HYDRAULIC AND HYDROLOGIC DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   In the hydraulic and hydrologic design of major erosion control
measures (those whose tributary drainage area is greater than three acres) such
as sediment basins and traps, diversions and the like, the design frequency
shall be commensurate with the risk of the design event being exceeded.
   (B)   The following design frequencies shall be regarded as minimum design
frequencies for the construction period.
      (1)   For those projects whose construction period is less than six
months, then the storm event having a 50% chance (two-year event) of being
exceeded in any year shall be used for design purposes.
      (2)   For those projects whose construction period is greater than six
months but less than one year, the design frequency for major sediment basins
shall be a rainfall event with a 20% (five-year event) chance of being exceeded
in any one year.
      (3)   For those construction projects expected to last more than one
year, major sediment basins shall be designed for a rainfall event with a 10%
(ten-year event) chance of being exceeded in any one year.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.040 "AS-NEEDED" PRACTICES ON THE PLANS.
   (A)   The sediment and erosion control plan shall designate a series of
practices which shall be implemented either at the direction of the permittee
or the permittee's representative on-site or at the direction of the
Administrator should an inspection of the site indicate a deficiency in soil
and sediment erosion control measures.
   (B)   As a minimum, these measures shall include the following;
      (1)   Sedimentation basins;
      (2)   Sediment traps;
      (3)   Diversion swales;
      (4)   Silt fences;
      (5)   Temporary seeding;
      (6)   Mulching; and
      (7)   Erosion control blankets.

§ 151.041 SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   Sediment and erosion control plans shall be in accordance with §§
151.080 through
151.085 but shall include the following:
   (A)   Detailed construction phasing plan identifying sediment and erosion
control measures to be in place for each phase shall be submitted prior to
stripping the site of existing vegetation or cover.
   (B)   Sediment and erosion control measures to be installed initially prior
to stripping existing vegetation or mass grading shall be indicated on the
plans.
   (C)   Permanent stabilization measures shall be indicated on a separate
plan.
   (D)   The expected two-year and ten-year runoff rates from all off-site
areas draining into the site shall be identified on the plan.
   (E)   Methods for conveying flows through the site during construction shall
be indicated. These methods must include the temporary and permanent
stabilization measures to be used to reduce velocity and erosion from flow
through the construction zone.
   (F)   A maintenance schedule of each measure used shall be indicated on the
plan. As a minimum, all sediment and erosion control measures on-site shall be
inspected weekly and also by the applicant's designee or after a one-half inch
(0.5”) or greater rainfall event and any required repairs shall be made to keep
these measures functional as designed. All repairs and modifications shall be
reviewed by the Administrator or his or her designee.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.042 CONVEYANCE OF OFF-SITE FLOW.
   (A)   To the extent practicable, proposed ditches and waterways which are to
convey off-site flows through the site shall be stabilized upon construction.
   (B)   Where new waterways are constructed, they shall be stabilized to the
extent practicable prior to their use to convey flood flows.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.043 STOCKPILES.
   (A)   Stockpiles of soil and other erodible or floatable building materials
(sand, limestone and the like) shall not be located in floodplains, overflow
routes or areas subject to frequent inundation.
   (B)   If a stockpile is to remain in place for more than three days, then
sediment and erosion control shall be provided for the stockpile.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.044 STORM SEWER INLETS.
   Storm sewer inlets shall be protected with sediment trapping and/or filter
control devices during construction.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.045 CONSTRUCTION DEWATERING.
   Water pumped or which is otherwise discharged from the site during
construction dewatering shall be filtered and a means provided to reduce
erosion.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.046 PROTECTION OF PUBLIC/PRIVATE ROADWAYS.
   Graveled roads, access drives, parking areas of sufficient width and length
and vehicle wash down facilities, if necessary, shall be provided to prevent
soils from being tracked onto public or private roadways. Any soil tracked onto
a public or private roadway shall be removed before the end of each workday or
sooner as directed by the authority maintaining the roadway.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.047 TEMPORARY STREAM CROSSINGS.
   Temporary stream crossings of intermittent and perennial streams used only
for and during construction shall be designed to convey a two-year flood
(minimum) or other flood event approved by the Administrator without
overtopping unless a more frequent design event is allowed by the
Administrator. The entire crossing shall be designed to withstand hydrodynamic
forces and erosive forces up to the base flood event without washing out.
Ephemeral streams may be crossed at temporary at-grade crossings provided that
the crossing point is stabilized with materials resistive to the erosive forces
produced by runoff from the upstream drainage area, and the design is approved
by the Administrator. Temporary stream crossings shall be removed upon
completion of construction activities. All temporary stream crossing shall be
completely removed, and the stream restored to its preconstruction condition
upon completion of construction. Restoration shall incorporate appropriate
vegetation consistent with the adjacent existing vegetation prior to
construction or in accordance with a restoration plan approved by the
Administrator.

PROTECTION OF SPECIAL MANAGEMENT AREAS
§ 151.060 GENERAL.
   (A)   This subchapter sets forth requirements for developments within
floodplains and floodways. In addition, developments in the SFHA draining more
than one square mile with no designated floodway must meet IDNR/OWR Ill. Adm.
Code Part 3700 Rules. References to IDNR/OWR permits or approvals in this
section shall be construed as "their designee" where a portion or all their
authority has been delegated.
   (B)   Development that qualifies for any of the self-issuing statewide or
regional permits administered by IDNR/OWR (Statewide Permit Nos. 1 through 14
and Regional Permit No. 3) are similarly permitted under this subchapter. The
developer need only submit to the Administrator information as shall show the
Administrator that the development qualifies for the particular statewide or
regional permit in question under the regulations established by IDNR/OWR for
the permit and no further submittal need be made under this subchapter. All
other provisions of this chapter applicable to the development, however,
continue to apply. However, a permit from the county or the certified community
must still be issued.
   (C)   All development shall meet the requirements set forth in Table 1. The
table is intended only as a guide to indicate the applicable ordinance sections

§ 151.061 FLOODPLAIN, REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN, BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) AND
REGULATORY FLOODWAY LOCATIONS.
   (A)   The BFE shall be delineated onto the site topography to establish the
regulatory floodplain area limits for regulation under this chapter. Regulatory
floodplains shall be delineated onto the site map from the current FEMA FIRM
(see Appendix A), FBFM or LOMR and include those areas of the SFHA which are
not regulatory floodplains. Each community, whether certified or not, remains
responsible for maintaining the effective FIS and a list of FIRM panels for
their respective communities.
   (B)   The BFE shall be:
      (1)   The elevation of the 100-year profile corresponding to the location
of the development as indicated in the flood profiles in the FEMA Flood
Insurance Studies listed in Appendix A, or as adopted by each community (which
may be updated from time to time);
      (2)   In the case of FEMA delineated “AH Zones” the elevation noted on
the map shall be the BFE. In the case of FEMA delineated “AO Zones” the BFE
shall be the depth number shown on the map added to the highest adjacent grade,
or at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is
provided;
      (3)   (a)   When no BFE information exists and the upstream tributary
drainage area is 640 acres or greater, the BFE shall be determined using a site
specific floodplain study by a professional engineer using appropriate
hydrologic and hydraulic models as follows:
            1.   Hydrologic models: TR-20, HEC-1, HEC-HMS;
            2.   Hydraulic models: HEC-2, HEC-RAS, WSP-2; or
            3.   A technique approved by the Administrator and the IDNR/OWR.
         (b)   Where a channel has a tributary drainage area of 640 acres or
more, the above analyses shall be submitted to the IDNR/OWR for concurrent
approval.
         (c)   For a non-riverine regulatory floodplain, the historic flood of
record plus three feet may be used for the BFE instead of performing a detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic study.
      (4)   For floodplains that are not regulatory, are not draining more than
640 acres, and with
no BFE determined, the Administrator may require a site-specific floodplain
study for the purpose of establishing an FPE for the development.
   (C)   (1)   The location of the regulatory floodway shall be as delineated
on the current effective regulatory maps maintain by each community. The
location of the regulatory floodway boundary shall be scaled onto the site plan
using references common to both the map and the plan (typically the center
lines of adjacent roadways). Where an interpretation is needed to determine the
exact location of the regulatory floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be
contacted.
      (2)   Note: If an area of the site is located in the regulatory floodway
that is higher than the BFE, that area is subject to the floodway standards of
§
151.064, including the appropriate use criteria, until a time as a LOMR is
received from FEMA with concurrence by IDNR/OWR.
      (3)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations in the regulatory
floodway are as follows.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and data in the current effective FIS
must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to
be in error or conditions have changed, FEMA and IDNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
The Director shall be copied on all related correspondence.
         (b)   If the BFE at the site of the proposed development is affected
by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area,
the proposed development shall be shown to meet the requirements of this
section with the receiving stream at both the normal water and BFEs.
         (c)   If the applicant is informed by IDNR/OWR, local governments, or
a private owner that a downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is
scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified or a regional flood control
project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the
next five years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and shown to meet
the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the
expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control
project is built, removed or modified as applicable.
         (d)   If the appropriate use will result in a change in the regulatory
floodway location or a change in the BFE, the applicant shall submit the
information required to be issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)
to IDNR/OWR and FEMA. A public notice inviting public comment on the proposed
change in the BFE or location of the regulatory floodway will be issued by
IDNR/OWR or its designee before a CLOMR is issued. Filling, grading, dredging
or excavating may take place upon issuance of a conditional approval from IDNR/
OWR and the Administrator. No further development activities shall take place
in the existing or proposed floodplain until a letter of map revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA unless the activities meet all the requirements of §
151.062 of this chapter. The Director shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
         (e)   For those circumstances listed below and located in a regulatory
floodway, at a minimum, the following information shall be submitted to IDNR/
OWR for their review and concurrence:
            1.   Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge,
culvert crossings and roadway approaches;
            2.   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge, culvert
crossing or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the analysis
indicating the proposed flood profile;
            3.   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
compensatory storage; and
            4.   Stormwater management permits to local units of government for
regulatory floodway and floodplain development.
         (f)   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for any IDNR/OWR projects, dams and
the like all other state, Federal or WCSMC or certified community projects.

§ 151.062 GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally. The following general performance standards are applicable
to all development in a regulatory floodplain. The standards of this section
apply except when superseded by more stringent requirements in the subsequent
sections.
      (1)   No development except as allowed in §
151.066 shall be allowed in the regulatory floodplain that singularly or
cumulatively creates an increase in flood stage or velocity off-site, or a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity on-site
or threat to public health, safety and welfare.
      (2)   For all projects involving a channel modification, fill, stream
maintenance or a levee, the flood conveyance and storage capacity of the
regulatory floodplain shall not be reduced.
      (3)   If the proposed development would result in a change in the
regulatory floodplain or BFE as indicated in Appendix A, or as adopted by each
community, the applicant shall obtain a LOMR from FEMA. No buildings may be
built in the existing or proposed regulatory floodplain until the LOMR receives
concurrence from IDNR/OWR and is issued by FEMA and the building meets all the
building protection standards (division (C) below). Proposed changes to the
regulatory floodway delineation and the BFE must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for
concurrence.
      (4)   If the development is located in a public body of water, as defined
by IDNR/OWR (
Chapter 164, Appendix C), a permit or a waiver of a permit must also be
received from IDNR/OWR.
      (5)   Prior to the commencement of any construction, modification or
removal of a dam the developer shall obtain an IDNR/OWR permit or letter
indicating a permit is not required.
      (6)   (a)   For public flood control projects, the Floodplain Management
standards will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR
and WCSMC that each of the following conditions are met:
            1.   Demonstrate by hydraulic and hydrologic modeling that the
proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood
heights outside the project site or demonstrate that any increases will be
contained in easements for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event;
            2.   Demonstrate that the project will be operated and maintained
by a public agency; and
            3.   Demonstrate that the project will reduce flood damage to an
existing building or structure.
         (b)   These standards do not preclude the design, engineering,
construction or financing, in whole or in part of a public flood control
project by persons who are not public agencies.
      (7)   Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, planned
unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home park and additions
to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation
data and floodway delineations.
   (B)   Public health protection standards.
      (1)   New and replacement water supply systems, wells and sanitary sewer
lines may be permitted if all manholes or other aboveground openings located
below the FPE are watertight.
      (2)   New on-site waste disposal systems, such as septic systems, are
allowed in the regulatory floodplain only if they meet all of the following
conditions.
         (a)   The invert of any wastewater distribution lines shall be a
minimum of two-feet above the water surface elevation of the base flow of any
perennial stream.
         (b)   The lateral distance from a ditch, creek or other riverine
source to the wastewater distribution lines shall be a minimum of 75.
         (c)   The elevation of any areas which are to receive wastewater
distribution shall be above the ordinary high water mark.
         (d)   The soil of the receiving field shall be of a type suitable for
septic fields.
         (e)   The tank shall be placed out of the floodplain with the invert
of the outlet above the BFE.
      (3)   New, substantially improved or replacement wastewater treatment
plants shall have watertight openings for those openings located below the FPE.
The facilities should be located to avoid impairment to the facility or
contamination of floodwaters during the base flood.
   (C)   Building protection standards. The building protection standards apply
to all buildings located in the regulatory floodplain; however, it should be
noted that most new and replacement buildings are not appropriate uses of the
regulatory floodway.
      (1)   The lowest floor including basements of all new residential
structures, substantially improved structures and additions shall be elevated
up to at least the FPE. An attached garage for a structure must be elevated up
to at least 0.1 feet above the BFE.
         (a)   If placed on fill, the top of the fill for the residential
structure shall be above the FPE. The top of fill for an attached garage shall
be at least 0.1 foot above the BFE. The fill shall be placed at that elevation
for a distance of ten feet out from the building unless the building design is
certified by a registered structural engineer to be protected from damages due
to hydrostatic pressures. Additionally, the fill shall not settle below the FPE
for the residential structure and not below 0.1 feet above the base flood for
an attached garage, and shall be adequately protected against erosion, scour
and differential settlement. The fill should not adversely affect surface
drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
         (b)   If elevated by means of walls, pilings or other foundation, the
building's supporting structure must be permanently open to flood waters and
not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood. The permanent
openings shall be no more than one foot above existing grade and consist of a
minimum of two openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding below the BFE. The lowest inside grade must match the lowest existing
outside grade adjacent to the structure. The foundation and supporting members
shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining
structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces such as
current, waves, ice and floating debris. All areas below the FPE shall be
constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including
basement) for the residential structure and all electrical, heating,
ventilating, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall
be located at or above the FPE. An attached garage must be elevated to at least
0.1 feet above the BFE. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines,
submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located
below the FPE. No area below the FPE shall be used for storage,
      (2)   The lowest floor including the basement of all new or substantially
improved nonresidential buildings shall be elevated at least to the FPE as
described above or be structurally dry floodproofed to at least the FPE. A
nonresidential building may be structurally dry floodproofed (in lieu of
elevation) provided that a professional engineer or registered structural
engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed
below the FPE and the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight
and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood. The building design
shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or
ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and
without an outside source of electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar
works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this division).
      (3)   Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed on a
site for more than 180 days shall be at or above the FPE and shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with the State
Manufactured Home Tie-Down Code (77 Ill. Admin. Code 870), as amended.
      (4)   (a)   Accessory structures, such as tool sheds and detached garages
which are not substantial improvements on an existing single-family lot, may be
constructed with the lowest floor below the FPE in accordance with the
following criteria.
            1.   The building shall not be used for human habitation.
            2.   All areas below the FPE shall be constructed with waterproof
material. Structures located in a regulatory floodway shall meet the floodway
standards in §
55.064.
            3.   The structure shall be anchored to prevent flotation and
movement.
            4.   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be elevated or floodproofed to the FPE.
            5.   The building shall be no greater than 600 square feet in floor
size and be valued at less than $7,500. The building shall meet the permanent
opening criteria of division (C)(1)(b) above.
            6.   The building shall be used only for the storage of vehicles or
tools and may not contain basements or other rooms, workshops, greenhouses or
similar uses.
         (b)   Accessory structures that do not meet all the above criteria may
be constructed if they are dry floodproofed or elevated at least one-half of
one foot above the BFE.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood,
fire, wind or other disaster may be restored unless the damage meets or exceeds
50% of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall conform
to the building protection standards of this chapter.

§ 151.063 COMPENSATORY STORAGE VOLUME STANDARDS.
   The following standards apply within the regulatory floodplain.
   (A)   Hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage volume will be required
for development in a riverine regulatory floodplain and shall be at least equal
to the regulatory floodplain flood storage volume displaced. The storage volume
displaced below the existing ten-year frequency flood elevation must be
replaced below the proposed ten-year frequency flood elevation. The storage
volume displaced above the ten-year existing frequency flood elevation must be
replaced above the proposed ten-year frequency flood elevation.
   (B)   Compensatory storage volume for development in a non-riverine
regulatory floodplain area that is also adjacent to a lake shall be equal to
the storage volume displaced.
   (C)   Compensatory storage volume requirements for development in a non-
riverine regulatory floodplain that is not adjacent to a lake shall be replaced
in accordance with the requirements for the loss of depressional storage in §
151.021(F).
   (D)   Compensatory storage areas shall be designed to drain freely and
openly to the channel and shall be located adjacent to the development. This
standard does not apply to non-riverine regulatory floodplain.
   (E)   A recorded covenant running with the land is required to maintain the
compensatory storage volume in areas modified to provide compensatory storage
volume.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.064 FLOODWAY STANDARDS.
   (A)   The only development in a regulatory floodway which will be allowed
are appropriate uses which will not cause an increase in flood heights or
velocities for all flood events up to and including the base flood. Only those
appropriate uses listed below will be allowed in the regulatory floodway.
   (B)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any
new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, fencing
(including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of
materials except as specifically defined below as an appropriate use. If the
development is proposed for the regulatory floodway portion of the regulatory
floodplain, the following standards apply in addition to the standards for the
regulatory floodplain.
      (1)   Only the construction, modification, repair or replacement of the
following appropriate uses will be allowed in the regulatory floodway;
         (a)   Public flood control structures and private improvements
relating to the control of drainage and flooding of existing buildings,
erosion, water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
         (b)   Structures or facilities relating to functionally water
dependent uses such as additions, modifications and improvements to existing
wastewater treatment plants (except for additions to habitable structures on
the site) and facilities and improvements relating to recreational boating
(this does not include new wastewater treatment plants);
         (c)   Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
         (d)   Underground and overhead utilities;
         (e)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields, open pavilions
and trail systems including any related fencing (at least 50% open when viewed
from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows;
         (f)   Detached garages, storage sheds, boat houses or other non-
habitable structures without sanitary facilities that are accessory to existing
buildings and will not block flood flows nor reduce regulatory floodway
storage;
         (g)   Bridges, culverts and associated roadways, sidewalks and
railways, required for crossing the regulatory floodway or for access to other
appropriate uses in the regulatory floodway and any modification thereto;
         (h)   Parking lots built at or below existing grade provided that
either:
            1.   The BFE is less than one foot above the proposed parking lot;
or
            2.   The parking lot is accessory to short-term outdoor
recreational facilities and the owner agrees to restrict access during periods
of inundation and agrees to accept liability for all damage caused by vehicular
access during flooding events.
         (i)   Regulatory floodway grading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope
toward a channel;
         (j)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of water-tight window wells, elevating
structures or the construction of flood walls or berms around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the
floodwall or berm shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of
the existing structure, and, which are not considered to be substantial
improvements to the structure;
         (k)   The repair, replacement or reconstruction of a damaged building,
provided that none of the outside dimensions of the building are increased and
provided that the cost of repair is less than 50% of the building's value
before it was damaged. When damage is 50% or more (a substantial improvement),
the activity shall conform to §
151.062(C) of this chapter; and
         (l)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase
the enclosed floor area of the building below the BFE and which will not block
flood flows. These modifications include fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios
and second story addition. No enclosed floor areas may be built on stilts. The
modifications may not singularly or cumulatively equal 50% or more of the
building's market value.
      (2)   Additions or changes to the above list of appropriate uses must be
approved by the Committee prior to the adoption by the County Board and IDNR/
OWR.
      (3)   All development in the regulatory floodway shall require a permit
from IDNR-OWR and must be in accordance with all provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible
provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and
mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans,
calculations and data prepared and signed by a professional engineer.
         (a)   All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the
development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on-
stream structures or dams, shall be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the base flood.
         (b)   The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used to
determine transition sections in calculations of effective regulatory floodway
conveyance.
            1.   Flowing water will expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
            2.   Flowing water will contract no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
            3.   Flowing water will not expand or contract faster than one foot
vertical for every ten feet of flooded stream length.
            4.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
            5.   Transition sections must be used to determine the effective
conveyance areas on adjacent properties.
         (c)   Development of an appropriate use will not result in an increase
in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage. However, in
the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose
of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may
be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (5)   In the case of on-stream structures built for the purpose of
backing up water during normal or flood flows, the increase in flood stage when
compared to existing conditions for all storm events up to and including the
base flood event shall be contained within recorded easements or the channel
banks. A dam safety permit or letter indicating a dam safety permit is not
required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for the structures.
      (6)   IDNR/OWR will issue permits for any IDNR/OWR projects, dams and the
like and for all other state, WCSMC or certified community projects.

regulatory floodway.
   (B)   The applicant shall obtain approval from IDNR/OWR for all development
any portion of which is located partially or completely within the regulatory
floodplain (without a delineated regulatory floodway) with a tributary drainage
area of 640 acres or more.
      (1)   The development shall not singularly or cumulatively result in an
obstruction of flood
flows or potential flood damages outside the site due to an increase in flood
heights, velocities or loss of floodplain area storage.
      (2)   A professional engineer shall submit a study that demonstrates one
of the following:
         (a)   Determine a floodway which meets the definition of a regulatory
floodway and demonstrate that the proposed development meets the floodway
standards in §
151.064; or
         (b)   Determine a BFE and demonstrate that the proposed development
will maintain the existing conditions conveyance, will not increase flood
velocities, will not increase flood profiles and will compensate for any lost
floodplain storage.

§ 151.066 BRIDGE AND CULVERT STANDARDS.
   These standards are for the reconstruction, modification or new construction
of bridges, culvert crossings and roadway approaches located in the regulatory
floodplain.
   (A)   A proposed new structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than one- tenth foot when compared to the existing
conditions for all flood events up to and including the base flood event unless
contained within the channel banks or recorded easements. The evaluation must
be submitted to the IDNR-OWR for review and a permit obtained.
   (B)   If the proposed new structure will increase upstream flood stages
greater than one-tenth foot, the applicant must contact IDNR/OWR for a dam
safety permit or waiver. The Director shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
   (C)   Lost regulatory floodplain storage must be replaced as required in §
151.063, compensatory storage volume standards, except that artificially
created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind an existing bridge
or culvert crossing shall not be required to be replaced, provided no flood
damage will be incurred downstream.
   (D)   Velocity increases must be mitigated by use of appropriate measures to
avoid scour, erosion and sedimentation at the structure.
   (E)   For modification or replacement of existing structures, the existing
structure must first be evaluated in accordance with IDNR/OWR Rules (17 Ill.
Adm. Code Part 3708) to determine if the existing structure is a source of
flood damage. If the structure is a source of flood damage, the applicant's
engineer shall submit justification to allow the damage to continue and
evaluate the feasibility of relieving the structure's impact. Modifications or
replacement structures shall not increase flood stages (0.0 feet) compared to
the existing condition for all flood events up to and including the base flood
event. The evaluation must be submitted to IDNR/OWR, for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued. The Director shall be copied on all related
correspondence.
   (F)   If any work is proposed in, near or over a public body of water, a
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from
IDNR/OWR.
   (G)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing
the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to
IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required.

existing bridges or culverts.
      (2)   Where an existing crossing is not available, a temporary crossing
that has been issued a permit or waiver by IDNR/OWR shall be constructed in
which:
         (a)   The approach roads will be 0.5 feet or less above existing
grade;
         (b)   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall;
         (c)   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two
feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be non-
erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel; and
         (d)   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the
Administrator.

§ 151.144 GRANTING OF VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Land Use or Oversite Committee shall not recommend, nor shall the
County Board or corporate authority grant a variance for a project from the
provisions of this chapter unless the variance is consistent with the purpose
of this chapter (§
151.003) and meets the following standards based upon substantial evidence
submitted at the hearing.
      (1)   The variance will not increase measurably the probability of flood
damage to insurable structures.
      (2)   The variance requested is the minimum required considering each of
the following statements of underlying intent of this chapter and there are no
means other than the requested variance by which the alleged hardships can be
avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit the reasonable
continuation of the development.
         (a)   Detention of stormwater shall also contribute to the improvement
of the quality of stormwater runoff.
         (b)   The volume of detention storage provided in open air vegetated
facilities is maximized consistent with other land use site constraints
including zoning requirements essential for the proposed development.
         (c)   Conveyance of stormwater from the project shall not increase
peak discharges from existing offsite conveyance facilities beyond design
capacity for any storm event from the two-year to the 100-year flood frequency.
         (d)   High quality natural areas shall be preserved on the site,
including without limiting the generality of the foregoing, stands of native
trees, existing wetlands, natural floodplain storage or other valuable
environmental and biological resources.
      (3)   The variance is not requested solely for the purpose of increasing
the density of the development nor impervious areas on the site.
      (4)   The variance is not requested solely as a result of economic
hardship.
      (5)   If applicable, the variance is required due to unique, natural
topographical features of the site.
      (6)   The applicant's circumstances are not self-imposed.
   (B)   No variance shall be granted for any development in the regulatory
floodway, the effect of which would be to create regulation less restrictive
than the federal or state minimum standards applicable to development in the
areas.
   (C)   When a variance would lessen the degree of flood surface runoff
protection to any structure, the Administrator shall notify the applicant that
the variance, if granted, may result in increased rates for flood insurance.

impose specific conditions and limitations concerning any matter relating to
the purposes and objectives of this chapter on the applicant as may be
necessary or appropriate.

PERFORMANCE SECURITY
§ 151.200 GENERAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   As security to the county or the certified community for the
performance by the developer of the developer's obligations to complete the
construction of any stormwater facilities required by the stormwater management
permit, to pay all costs, fees and charges due from the developer pursuant to
the permitting authorities of this chapter and to otherwise faithfully perform
the developer's undertakings pursuant to this chapter or the applicable
certified community ordinance, the developer shall, prior to issuance of a
stormwater management permit:
      (1)   Post a development security as provided in §
151.201 of this chapter; and
      (2)   Post a sediment and erosion control security as provided in §
151.202 of this chapter, if a sediment and erosion control plan is required
pursuant to §
151.082 of this chapter.
   (B)   The developer shall bear the full cost and responsibility of securing
and maintaining the securities required by this section.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.201 DEVELOPMENT SECURITY.
   (A)   A development security shall be posted and shall include:
      (1)   A schedule, agreed upon by the developer and the Director or the
Administrator, for the completion of the construction of any stormwater
facilities required by the permit;
      (2)   An irrevocable letter of credit, or other adequate security as the
Director or the Administrator may approve, in an amount equal to not less than
110% of the estimated probable cost to complete the construction of any
stormwater facilities required by the stormwater management permit, which
estimated probable cost shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer
and shall be approved by the Director or the Administrator. A corporation with
a bond rating of "A" or higher from a major investment firm (i.e., Standard and
Poor, Moody or equivalent) would be deemed to have adequate credit worthiness
and thus is not required to post a letter of credit for projects that are not
required to be located in public easements;
      (3)   A statement signed by the applicant granting the Director or the
Administrator the right to draw on the security and the right to enter the
development site to complete required work in the event that work is not
completed according to the work schedule; and
      (4)   A statement signed by the applicant that the applicant shall
indemnify the community and the Department for any additional costs incurred
attributable to the concurrent activities of or conflicts between the
applicant's contractor and the community or Department's remedial contractor at
the site.
   (B)   The security required by this section shall be maintained and renewed
by the applicant and shall be held in escrow by the Director or the
Administrator until the conditions set forth in this section or other
applicable provisions are satisfied.
   (C)   The Administrator may approve periodic reductions in the letter of
credit based on progress of construction. However, not more than 90% of the
security provided for in this section may be released prior to approval of
record drawings and final inspection. A minimum of 10% of the security shall be
retained for a period of time not to exceed one year after completion of
construction of all stormwater facilities required by the permit.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.202 SEDIMENT AND EROSION CONTROL SECURITY.
   (A)   If a sediment and erosion control plan is required pursuant to §
151.082 of this chapter, then a sediment and erosion control security shall be
required. The security shall include:
      (1)   An irrevocable letter of credit, or other adequate security as the
Director or the Administrator shall approve, in an amount equal to not less
than 110% of the estimated probable cost to install and maintain the sediment
and erosion control measures, which estimated probable cost shall be approved
by the Director or the Administrator; and
      (2)   A statement signed by the applicant granting the Director or the
Administrator, as applicable, the right to draw on the security and the right
to enter the development site to complete sediment and erosion control measures
in the event that the measures are not installed and/or maintained according to
the established schedule.
   (B)   The security required by this section shall be maintained and renewed
by the applicant and shall be held in escrow by the Director or the
Administrator, as applicable, until the conditions set forth in this section
are satisfied.
   (C)   After completion of construction, establishment of vegetation, removal
of all sediment from stormwater facilities, and final inspection and approval
by the Director or Administrator, as applicable, 100% of the sediment and
erosion control security shall be released.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
§ 151.203 LETTERS OF CREDIT.
   (A)   Letters of credit posted pursuant to §§
151.200 through
151.203 of this chapter shall be in a form satisfactory to the Director or the
Administrator, as applicable.
   (B)   Each letter of credit shall be from a lending institution:
      (1)   Acceptable to the Director or the Administrator, as applicable;
      (2)   Having capital resources of at least $10,000,000, or another amount
acceptable to the Director or the Administrator;
      (3)   With an office in the Chicago metropolitan area; and
      (4)   Insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
   (C)   Each letter of credit shall, at a minimum, provide that:
      (1)   It shall not be canceled without the prior written consent of the
Director or the Administrator; and shall not expire without written
notification of the Director or Administrator at least 45 days prior to
expiration;
      (2)   It shall not require the consent of the developer prior to any draw
on it by the Director or the Administrator; and
      (3)   If at any time it will expire within 45 or any lesser number of
days, and if it has not been renewed and the renewal submitted to the Director
or the Administrator, and if any applicable obligation of the developer for
which its security remains uncompleted or is unsatisfactory, then the Director
or the Administrator may, without notice and without being required to take any
further action of any nature whatsoever, call and draw down the letter of
credit and thereafter either hold all proceeds as security for the satisfactory
completion of all obligations or employ the proceeds to complete all
obligations and reimburse the county or the certified community for any and all
costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative costs, incurred by
the county or the certified community, as the Director or the Administrator
shall determine.
   (D)   If at any time the Director or the Administrator determines that the
funds remaining in the letter of credit are not, or may not be, sufficient to
pay in full the remaining unpaid cost of all stormwater facility construction
or sediment and erosion control measures, then, within ten days following a
demand by the Director or the Administrator, the developer shall increase the
amount of the letter of credit to an amount determined by the Director or the
Administrator to be sufficient to pay the unpaid costs. Failure to so increase
the amount of the security shall be grounds for the Director or the
Administrator to draw down the entire remaining balance of the letter of
credit,
   (E)   If at any time the Director or the Administrator determines that the
bank issuing the letter of credit is without capital resources of at least
$10,000,000, is unable to meet any federal or state requirement for reserves,
is insolvent, is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing or is otherwise in
danger of being unable to honor the letter of credit at any time during its
term, or if the Director or the Administrator otherwise reasonably deems the
bank to be insecure, then the Director or the Administrator shall have the
right to demand that the developer provide a replacement letter of credit from
a bank satisfactory to the Director or the Administrator. The replacement
letter of credit shall be deposited with the Director or the Administrator not
later than ten days following the demand. Upon the deposit, the Director or the
Administrator shall surrender the original letter of credit to the developer.
   (F)   (1)   If the developer fails or refuses to meet fully any of its
obligations under this chapter or the applicable certified community ordinance,
then the Director or the Administrator may, in his or her discretion, draw on
and retain all or any of the funds remaining in the letter of credit.
      (2)   The Director or the Administrator thereafter shall have the right
to take any action he or she deems reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the
effects of the failure or refusal, and to reimburse the county or the certified
community from the proceeds of the letter of credit for all of its costs and
expenses, including legal fees and administrative expenses, resulting from or
incurred as a result of the developer's failure or refusal to fully meet its
obligations under this chapter or the applicable certified community ordinance.
      (3)   If the funds remaining in the letter of credit are insufficient to
repay fully the county or the certified community for all costs and expenses,
and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required letter of credit during
the entire time the letter of credit should have been maintained by the
developer, then the developer shall, upon demand of the Director or the
Administrator therefore, immediately deposit with the Director of the
Administrator additional funds as the Director or the Administrator determines
are necessary to fully repay costs and expenses and to establish the cash
reserve.
(Ord. 18-08, passed 1-14-19)
FEE-IN-LIEU OF ON-SITE DETENTION
§ 151.215 FEE-IN-LIEU OF ON-SITE DETENTION.
   (A)   The Director or the Administrator may require the payment of a fee-in-
lieu of on-site detention to fulfill all or part of the on-site detention
requirement for a development. Fee-in-lieu of on-site detention shall be the
lesser of:
      (1)   The fee computed for each acre-foot or part thereof of detention
required and approved in accordance with the procedures and schedules as
approved and adopted by the county or the certified community; or
      (2)   The estimated construction cost, as approved by the county or the
certified community

submit, a written request for the payment of a fee-in-lieu of on-site detention
to fulfill all of part of the on-site detention requirement in accordance with
§
151.022(B) a request for fee-in-lieu of on-site detention shall be either
rejected or approved within 45 days of the written request unless additional
engineering studies are required.
      (2)   Approval of a request for fee-in-lieu of on-site detention on a
development site shall be determined by the Director or the Administrator.
      (3)   A fund will be maintained by the certified community or the county
for non-certified communities for each of the major watersheds for the purpose
of identifying and controlling all revenues and expenses related to stormwater
drainage services resulting from fee-in-lieu of on-site detention approvals.
All moneys collected for fee-in-lieu of on-site detention shall be deposited in
these funds and may only be used for purposes related to stormwater management
as noted in division (B)(4) below.
      (4)   Fee-in-lieu of on-site detention revenues from development site may
be used to plan, design or construct an upgrade to existing or future
stormwater management systems if the upgrade is consistent with a basin plan,
floodplain study or stormwater system improvement that has been approved by the
county for non-certified communities or the community elected board of
officials in a certified community.

§ 154.002 PURPOSE.
   (A)   To provide for the health, safety, comfort, general welfare, and

chapter is enacted as the subdivision regulations of the official plan of the
village to establish reasonable standards of design for subdivisions and the
re-subdivisions of unimproved land and of areas subject to redevelopment within
the village, and contiguous incorporated territory. Other purposes of these
regulations are:
      (1)   To insure sound, harmonious subdivision development and community
growth and to safeguard the interest of the village, home owner, the
subdivider, and the investor.
      (2)   To assure the development of land for optimum use with necessary
protection against deterioration and obsolescence.
      (3)   To limit and control the pollution of the environment that can be
caused by inadequate or incomplete urban development.
      (4)   To provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working
relationship between the village and the subdivider.
      (5)   To lessen congestion in the streets and highways.
      (6)   To provide for adequate light and air.
      (7)   To facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks, and other public necessities.
      (8)   To insure proper legal description and proper monumenting of
subdivided land.
   (B)   The regulations are established with reasonable consideration of the
character of the village with a view toward conserving the value of buildings
upon the land and providing the best possible environment for human habitation.
It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions and development standards contained in the
building code, official map regulations, zoning ordinance, and the official

RESTRICTIONS ON LAND BEFORE APPROVAL.
   (A)   Wherever any subdivision of land shall here after be laid out within
the incorporated limits of the village or within contiguous territory not more
than 1½ miles beyond the incorporated boundaries of the village, the subdivider
thereof or his agent shall submit both a preliminary and a final subdivision
plat to the village for its approval. The subdivision plats and procedures
relating thereto shall in all respected be in full compliance with these
regulations.

      (1)   No land shall be subdivided nor any street laid out, nor any
improvements made to the natural land.
      (2)   No lot, tract, or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be
offered for sale, nor shall any sale, contract for sale, or option be made or
given.
      (3)   No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water
drainage, sanitary sewer facilities, gas service, electrical service, lighting,
grading, paving, or surfacing of streets shall hereafter be made by any owner
or his agent, or by any public service corporation at the request of such owner
or his agent.
      (4)   Unsuitable land.
         (a)    No land shall be subdivided for any use which is determined by
the Plan Commission, after investigations by the Village Engineer, to be
unsuitable for such use by reason of flooding or bad drainage, adverse earth
and rock formation or topography, or any other feature likely to be harmful to
the health, safety, or welfare of the future residents in the proposed
subdivision or of the community. However, if the subdivider agrees to make
improvements which will, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, make the area
safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage and storm water
detention facilities, the subdivision may then be approved.
         (b)   For flood limits, surface water runoff, and hardship, refer to
the following:
            1.   Flood hazards. Any use of the flood plain shall not reduce the
area available for flooding purposes nor cause any hazard to surrounding
properties.
            2   .Surface water runoff.

subdivider or developer to accomplish the limit of surface water runoff as
herein forth set forth. Where waterways, channels, ditches, streams, or rivers
are traversed, the design of the facilities should not be less than a 100-year
frequency storm.
               c.   Due cognizance shall be taken to the effect of development
of any land tract to downstream owner and surrounding areas affected by
rainfall and surface water runoff.
            3.   Hardship. Where the land developer or subdivider can show that
the strict adherence to the design standards set forth causes an unnecessary
hardship, the Village Board of Trustees may approve a variance. Such variance
may be granted or denied after recommendation of the Plan Commission and where
topography and conditions peculiar to the site or surrounding area substantiate
a variance without destroying the intent of the provisions of this chapter.
Such recommendation of the Plan Commission may be base on an opinion of the
Village Engineer.
   (C)   All offerings or dedications of land to the village for use as
streets, highways, alleys, schools, parks, playgrounds, or other public uses
shall be referred to the Plan Commission for review and recommendation before
being accepted by the Village Board of Trustees or any other governing
authority of the village.
   (D)   Where a tract of land proposed for a subdivision is part of a larger,
logical subdivision unit in relation to the village as a whole, the Plan
Commission may, before approval, cause to be prepared a plan for the entire
area, or neighborhood, such plan to be used by the Plan Commission as an aid in
judging the proposed plat. The Village Engineer shall cooperate with the Plan
Commission by furnishing such surveys and data as may be necessary.

for front, rear, and side yards.
   (G)   A subdivision plat shall in no case be approved which shall be
dependent upon individual septic tanks.
   (H)   Every residential lot shall abut on a dedicated and improved street
for a minimum of 50 feet.
   (I)   In general, lots should be as nearly rectangular as practicable.
   (J)   Side lot lines of lots shall be at right angles or radial to the
street line, unless a variation to this rule will give better street or lot
plan.
   (K)   Depths and widths of lots or properties reserved or laid out for
commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-
street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and
development contemplated.
   (L)   In the subdividing of any land, due regard shall be given to the
preservation of natural features, such as trees, water courses, historical
landmarks, and similar community assets, which, if preserved, would add to the
attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood or the community as a
whole.
   (M)   Lots, blocks, Planned Unit Developments, commercial and industrial
developments shall be so graded as to eliminate depressions (except as designed
detention ponds) that would accumulate storm water. Grades at building sites
shall bear such relationships to roadway and curb grades as to prevent flooding
of basements or entranceways. Where deemed necessary, the Building Commissioner
shall require the subdivider to submit working drawings showing contours to
which the property is to be graded to provide for the requirements of this
division. In such cases, building permits shall not be issued unless the lot
plan indicates site and building grades are consistent with the grading
drawings.

   Larger than 6.0" line:                             $6,705 per connection
For the purpose of determining fees in this division (A)
(4), line shall mean the size of the water service line,
not including fire sprinkler service lines.
 
    (B)   All village development fees set forth above shall be paid to the
village at the time a building permit shall be issued unless fees are paid.
   (C)   The use of development fees are as follows:
      (1)   Each department of the village receiving funds shall be fully bound
by all terms, conditions and covenants contained herein.
      (2)   All funds paid hereunder shall be held in an encumbered account by
each village entity receiving the same for the purpose of making only capital
expenditures for the particular governmental agency. That is, the Police
Department shall only use the funds for capital expenditures for the Police
Department and not for operating expenses, and the Building Department only for
capital improvements of the municipal facilities, and the Public Works
Department only for capital expenses for expanding the sewage disposal plant
and water treatment plant.
      (3)   Capital expenditures shall be defined as the acquisition of
equipment with an estimated useful life in excess of three years by purchase,
lease or lease purchase, the purchase of land, the construction of permanent
structures on said premises, the extension of water mains, sewer lines, or
other permanent improvements.
      (4)   All of said development fees shall be paid to the Village Treasurer
who shall transfer to the respective village departments to their accounts and
other governmental bodies involved, their share of the funds within 60 days of
the receipt thereof. All funds to be received by village departments shall be
placed in encumbered funds within 60 days of receipt.
      (5)   The payments received for any specified fund shall not be used for
any other fund or for purposes other than those specified herein.
   (D)   Real property affected shall be as follows:
      (1)   Single-family detached dwellings, on a single lot. Any lot zoned
for any single-family residential lot, platted after the effective date of this
chapter shall be required to pay the development fees imposed by this section.
      (2)   Multi-family lots. Any lot zoned for multi-family attached or
semidetached dwellings, including, but not limited to, townhouses,
condominiums, cooperative housing, row houses, and duplexes platted after the
effective date of this chapter shall pay a fee based on the total number of
dwelling units. That is one fee amount per each dwelling unit and as set forth
in this section.
      (3)   Business office, industrial and manufacturing lots. Any lot zoned
for business, office, industrial, or manufacturing platted after the effective
date of this chapter shall be required to pay the development fees imposed in
this section; a fee shall be imposed for each individual business office,
commercial or manufacturing unit on a given lot. Landlords and tenants shall be
joint and severally liable for the payment of the development fees imposed by
this section. The foregoing is imposed provided that any business or
manufacturer located on a lot shall be entitled to a credit of $250 from the
required development fees for each job estimated to be created by the
establishment of a business or manufacturing plant erected on any lot during
the first year of operation of the business or manufacturing plant. The person
or entity requesting such credit shall certify in writing, under oath, to the
village, the estimated number jobs for employees working at least 20 hours per
week. If, on a date one year from the date of issuance of an occupancy permit
by the village, the actual number of employees working 20 hours per week is not
as great as the number originally estimated, the village shall be reimbursed by
the person, firm, or corporation to whom the building permit is issued in the
amount of $250 for each employee under the estimated number, and the person to
whom the building permit is issued shall be liable in a court of law for such
amount.
      (4)   No lot platted prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be
encumbered by the terms of this chapter. Platted lots are defined as "any
subdivision having village final approval" and do not include a subdivision
only having preliminary approval of the village. Therefore, a subdivision
having preliminary approval will be subject to payment of development fees if
the final approval is after the effective date of this chapter. Platted lots
also include an existing village lot or parcel of land which is divided into
two or more parts. Therefore, any division of an existing village lot after the
effective date of this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of this
section.
   (E)   Any person who files an application with the Illinois Environmental
Protection Agency (IEPA) for water operating permits shall pay an amount equal
to the water connection charges provided hereunder for the number of dwelling
units, commercial, office, industrial or manufacturing buildings contemplated
for the entire development, based on the rate in effect on the date of
application for the IEPA permits. Such payments for water connection permits
shall be made in the following ways:
      (1)   In cash upon application to the IEPA.
      (2)   In cash upon application for each building permit for each dwelling
unit and commercial, office, industrial or manufacturing building or business,
provided that the permit applicant provides a letter of credit in form and
substance acceptable to the village for 100% of all connection fees for the
particular development or property. Such letter of credit shall include a
provision indicating that it will not terminate without at least 60 days, but
not more than 75 days, advance written notice to the village prior to its
expiration date, and such expiration date shall be a date which is no earlier
than 24 months subsequent to the date of filing a permit application with the
IEPA. This will be based on the amount indicated in the permit application to
the IEPA. All connection charges shall in any event be due and payable to the
village within 24 months after the date of application to the IEPA for the
permits. All connection charges paid at the time of building permits issued
prior to the expiration of the 24 month period regardless of the number of
dwelling units, commercial, office, manufacturing buildings or businesses built
at that time shall be credited to the amount owed at the end of the 24 month
period. Within 30 days prior to the end of the 24 month period, or any time
thereafter, or the expiration date of the letter of credit, whichever is
earlier, the village shall be entitled to draw upon said letter of credit to
pay the full amount of water connection fees owed at that time. Said letter of
credit shall be in addition to, and separate from, any other letter of credit
required under this Code of Peotone.
   (F)   Any persons who files an application with the IEPA for sewer operating
permits shall pay an amount equal to the sewer connection charges provided
hereunder for the number of dwelling units, commercial, office, industrial or
manufacturing buildings contemplated for the entire development, based on the
rate in effect on the date of application for the IEPA permits. Such payments
for sewer connection permits shall be made in one of the following ways:
      (1)   In cash upon application to the IEPA;
      (2)   In cash upon application for each building permit for each dwelling
unit and commercial, office, industrial, or manufacturing building or business
provided that the permit applicant provides a letter of credit in form and
substance acceptable to the village for 100% of all connection fees for the
particular development or property. Such letter of credit shall include a
provision indicating that it will not terminate without at least 60 days, but
not more than 75 days, advance written notice to the village prior to its
expiration date, and such expiration date shall be a date which is no earlier
than 24 months subsequent to the date of filing a permit application with the
IEPA. This will be based upon the amount indicated in the permit application to
the IEPA. All connection charges shall in any event be due and payable to the
village within 24 months after the date of application to the IEPA for the
permits. All connection charges paid at the time of building permits issued
prior to the expiration of the 24 month period regardless of the number of
dwelling nits, commercial, office, manufacturing buildings, or businesses built
at that time period shall be credited to the amount owed at the end of the 24
month period. Within 30 days prior to the end of the 24 month period or any
time thereafter, or the expiration date of the letter of credit, whichever is
earlier, the village shall be entitled to draw upon said letter of credit to
pay the full amount of sewer connection fees owed at the time. Said letter of
credit shall be in addition to, and separate from, any other letter of credit
required under this Code of Peotone.

§ 154.089 FIRE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTIONS.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat
of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer shall be required
to make a contribution of land for fire station sites or cash in lieu thereof
to serve the immediate needs of the residents of the development. The
contribution shall be in accordance with this section.
   (A)   Use of cash in lieu of land. When the development is small and the
resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is
inappropriate for a fire station site, the village, with the concurrence of the
District, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution
in lieu of the land dedication in accordance with division (D) of this section.
The cash contribution in-lieu-of Fire Protection District land dedication shall
be paid directly to the District and used by the District solely for the
acquisition of land for fire station sites to serve the immediate or future
needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the
improvement of other existing local fire station sites that already serve such
needs or for any other purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the
time of platting.
   (B)   Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the "fair market value" of an acre of land in the area that otherwise
would have been dedicated for a fire station site. The fair market value, on a
per acre basis, shall assume, unless determined otherwise pursuant to division
(G) of this section, that the land is zoned single-family-detached residential,
subdivided with appropriate frontage on a dedicated road, and has all
appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in division (F) of
this section, and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential
development. It has been estimated that the present "fair market value" of such
improved land in and surrounding the village is, as of the effective date of
this section, $90,000 per developed acre. This figure shall be adjusted by
ordinance from time to time with appropriate study and documentation. The "fair
market value" as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of
land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in division (G)
of this section. Failure to timely object to the "fair market value" as defined
above in accordance with division (G) of this section shall thereafter waive
any right to raise an objection at a later time.
   (C)   Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations
in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These
occasions will arise when:
      (1)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a fire station, in which case that portion of the land within the
subdivision falling within the fire station location shall be dedicated as a
site as stated above, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required
for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; or
      (2)   A major part of the local fire station site has already been
acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to
complete the site, in which case the remaining portion shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution (as determined in division (D) below) shall
be required in lieu thereof for the rest of the required land.
   (D)   Fees for cash in lieu of land. In the event that land is unsuitable
for dedications, additional land is not needed, or the subdivider or developer
elects to pay cash in lieu of land, the fee schedule set forth below shall
prevail.
      (1)   The base residential cash donation shall be determined by the
formula set forth in full in
Appendix C to this chapter entitled "Formula for Determining Fire Protection
District Impact Fees”;
      (2)   For commercial or industrial buildings, the amounts set forth in
full in
Appendix C to this chapter;
      (3)   Consistent with division (H) hereof, the District shall retain the
right to negotiate agreements with the developers which do not exceed the
formula contained in
Appendix C to this chapter. Any negotiated fee must be presented to the
corporate authorities on or before the time when the final plat is submitted
for approval, and in no event shall the negotiation of an impact fee pursuant
to this section hold up or delay a plat that is otherwise set for final
approval.
      (4)   The fees are based upon the District's impact fee study and current
data and may be changed by the village from time to time.
   (E)   Topography and grading.  The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purpose. Only areas that are legally buildable according to village standards,
zoning codes, rules and regulations shall be accepted as fire station sites. A
fire station site shall not be less than two acres in area and a headquarters
fire station site shall not be less than two acres.
   (F)   Improved sites.  All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for
full service of electrical, gas, telephone and other utility lines, water,
sewer, and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter), as
applicable to the location of the site, or shall be subject to an agreement to
provide for such condition in the future, and shall otherwise comply with
Village Code requirements. For purposes of this section, READY FOR FULL SERVICE
shall mean that such services are available on-site or at appropriate locations
at the perimeter of the site. In addition, all sites shall be suitable for
constructing a fire station facility and shall be free of any environmental
contamination.
   (G)   Objections.  An objection must be made, if at all, prior to the
approval by the corporate authorities of the final plat. A failure to object by
such time shall constitute a waiver of the right to object to the provisions of
this section. The corporate authorities shall make a good faith attempt to
resolve any objections regarding the fair market value of the land used to
calculate the cash contribution, as set forth in division (B), or any other
application of this section to a particular subdivision or planned development.
The objecting party, village and District may submit any evidence concerning
the objection they feel is appropriate for consideration by the corporate
authorities. The corporate authorities may retain the services of professionals
(attorneys, appraisers, statisticians and the like) to assist them in their
review of issues raised by any objection.
   (H)   Condition to annexation. The dedications of land or cash contribution
in lieu thereof required by this section shall also be required as a condition
to the annexation of any land to the village, and provisions therefore shall,
at a minimum, be incorporated in any annexation or pre-annexation agreement
governing such land. However, the District reserves the right to negotiate
dedications of land or cash in lieu of land or a combination thereof not to
exceed the fee set forth herein as set forth in division (D).
   (I)   Indemnification.  As a precondition to the village imposing fire
station land dedications and/or fees in lieu thereof, the District shall
execute an intergovernmental indemnification agreement in a form acceptable to
the village.
   (J)   Time of dedication or payment. Unless otherwise specified, the land or
cash in lieu of land contribution imposed by this section shall be dedicated or
paid directly to the District or its authorized agent prior to the issuance of
a village building permit. The District will then provide a certificate or
other proof to the village that the required land or cash contribution has been
made. In the event that the District and a developer reach an agreement
pursuant to division (D)(3), the village recognizes that a private contract has
been formed and the District shall notify the village of the alternate
arrangement.

§ 154.090 SPECIAL CONSULTANTS REVIEW ESCROW.
   (A)   To defray the costs specified in §§
154.085 and
154.086, and any other specialized costs that may be applicable, such reviews
by outside consultants will not be contracted for by the village until such
time as the applicant has deposited a sum sufficient to pay the full cost of
the consultants' services. The village will seek estimates of the cost of the
reviews from each of the consultants and notify the applicant of such
estimates. The applicant shall then deposit an amount equal to 110% of such
estimates into escrow with the village. Such deposit shall be by check or in
cash. At the time of receipt, the escrow amount shall be deposited in a
separate fund to be known as the consultant review escrow fund and in a
separate interest-bearing bank account subject to itemized verification of
expenditures made. The village will then draw amounts from said escrow deposit
to pay for the services of the consultants at such time as their bills are
submitted and become due and payable. If at any time the deposit, after such
draws, becomes less than 25% of the original deposit, then the applicant shall
deposit additional funds in an amount to be determined by the village, which
additional deposit shall increase the amount in the escrow account to an amount
sufficient to pay all remaining fees anticipated to be owed to the consultants.
If the amount on deposit ever is determined by the village to be insufficient
to pay for all remaining services for the consultants, or if the applicant ever
fails or refuses to make any required additional deposits, then all reviews by
the consultants shall cease until any required additional deposit is made and
the applicant will not be entitled to any continued review of his or her
application until the additional deposit is made. Once the reviews by the
consultants have been completed and they have been fully paid for their
services, then any remaining amount on deposit, less any interest income, shall
be refunded to the applicant. The interest income shall be retained by the
village to help pay for the administrative costs of the village.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to request a refund of
the escrow fund amount and, if no such request is received within three years
from the date the deposit was made, then the village shall be entitled to use
any amount remaining in said escrow fund for general corporate purposes.

DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES
§ 154.095 DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES OR FOR PAYMENTS OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of a subdivision, or of a final
plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be
required to dedicate land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future
needs of the residents of the developments or a cash contribution in lieu of
actual land dedication, or a combination of both at the option of the village,
in accordance with the following criteria and formula in this subchapter.
(Ord. 73-01, passed 1-9-73)
§ 154.096 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING SCHOOL SITE DEDICATION.
   (A)   Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to
be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly
upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: estimated
children to be served in each such school classification over the maximum
recommended number of students to be served in each school classification as
stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the minimum recommended number
of acres for a school site of each such school sites to serve the estimated
increased children in each such school classification.
   (B)   School classification and size of school site.
      (1)   School classification and size of school sites within the village
shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
 
                          Minimum Number of Students Maximum Number of Acres of
School Classification (By for each such School       Land for each School Site
Grades)                   Classification (Students)  of Such Classification
                                                     (Acres)
Elementary schools,
grades kindergarten       500                        10
through sixth (K-6)
Junior high schools,
grades seventh through    800                        18
eighth (7-8)
High schools, grades
ninth through twelfth (9- 1600                       41
12)
 
      (2)   The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the
affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
(Ord. 73-01, passed 1-9-73)
§ 154.097 CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF A SCHOOL SITE.
   (A)   Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to
be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school site, the
village, with the recommendation of the Board of Education of the school
district affected, shall require the subdivider, developer, or builder, to pay
a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required. The word SMALL in this
section is defined as a total number of proposed dwelling units that will
produce less than the maximum of students for one school for each school
classification as set forth in §
154.096(B).
   (B)   School classification and size of school site. The determination that
available land is inappropriate for a school site shall be made by the village
after inspection of the land by the Superintendent of Public Works of the
village, and after hearing the recommendation of the local school board and any
builder, subdivider, or developer affected. Any builder, subdivider, or
developer affected may request a hearing before the Plan Commission of the
village on the question of whether the proposed land is inappropriate as a
school site. Any builder, subdivider, or developer affected as well as the
local school board may present evidence at the hearing and in addition, the
Plan Commission in its discretion, may hear evidence from other interested
persons.
      (1)   Fair market value. The school district, if they are to be a
recipient of funds under this subchapter, shall prior to July 1 of each year
establish an average valuation indicating current market value of improved
property within that local school district. This valuation shall be for a
parcel of land meeting such standards of topography, soil condition, access,
and improvements as are determined by the local school board, and shall be of
such minimum size as established by the recommendations of the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction.
      (2)   Criteria requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations
in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land
dedication and a contribution and a contribution in lieu of land are both
necessary. These occasions will arise when:
         (a)   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision
falling within the school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid,
and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional
land that would have been required to be dedicated.
         (b)   A major part of the school site has already been acquired and
only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the
site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.

§ 154.098 POPULATION, DENSITY; FORMULA.
   (A)   The following table of population density is generally indicative of
current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction
and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of
land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is
filed thereto by the subdivider or developer.

   (B)   In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to
the Table of Estimated Student Population listed in division (A) of this
section, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated
additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit
development and in that event final determination of the density formula to be
used in such calculations shall be made by the Village Board of Trustees based
upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and
from other sources which may be submitted to the Village Board of Trustees by
the school district or others. It is recognized that population density, age
distribution, and local conditions change over the years and the specific
formula for the dedication of land, of the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as
stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
      (1)   Time of conveyance or payment.
         (a)   Any future subdivision, planned unit development, or trailer
park after the date of this amendment; and any subdivision or planned unit
development whose subdivision plat or development plat has been approved by the
Village after January 9, 1973 and who has not dedicated land or paid a cash
contribution as provided in this subchapter; shall, in the case of future
subdivisions as set forth in this division, convey to the school district
within 30 days after any subdivision plat or final planned unit development
plat has been recorded or trailer park use granted, the land required under
this subchapter; or in the case of the subdivision or planned unit development
as set forth in this division, the subdivider or planned unit developer shall
convey to the school district within 30 days from the date of this amendment,
the land required under this subchapter.
         (b)   However, any future subdivider or planned unit developer or
trailer park as set forth in division (a) above may make cash contributions as
provided for in this subchapter. Contributions will be required upon issuance
of any building permit by the village.
         (c)   In the case of existing subdivisions or planned unit development
as set forth in division (a) above, cash contributions shall be required under
this subchapter prior to the issuance of any building permit by the village.
         (d)   The cash contributions shall be made, in all cases, directly to
the school district and evidence of such payment shall be made at the time of
application for any building permit. The building permit will not be issued by
the village without receipt for the cash contribution.
         (e)   The amount of each payment of cash shall be determined by the
village and the subdivider or developer at the time of the approval of any
final subdivision plat or final plat of a planned unit development or trailer
park use.
         In the case of subdivisions or planned unit developments that have
previously been approved by the village and who have not made the cash
contributions, the amount of each payment of cash shall be determined by the
village and the subdivider or planned unit developer, prior to issuance of any

§ 154.099 RESERVATION OF ADDITIONAL LAND.
   Where the Comprehensive Plan or the standards of the village call for a
larger amount for school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit
development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land beyond the

acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final
plat.
(Ord. 73-01, passed 1-9-73)
§ 154.100 COMBINING WITH ADJOINING DEVELOPMENTS.
   Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than 40 acres, a
school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with

without hardship on a particular developer.
(Ord. 73-01, passed 1-9-73)
§ 154.101 TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADING.

electrical, water, sewer, and streets (including enclosed drainage, curbs, and
gutters) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision
made therefor. The sidewalks and trees normally included within the definition
of improved sites may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of
any such school site and construction of school facilities thereon.
(Ord. 73-01, passed 1-9-73)
§ 154.103 REQUIREMENT AS CONDITION FOR ANNEXATION.
   The dedication of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof required by

CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC USAGE
§ 154.110 CONTRIBUTION REQUIRED.
   (A)   As a condition to the issuance of any approval of a final plat of

single family residence, which land or cash shall be for public services,
facilities and open space purposes to serve the needs of the residents of the
development.
   (B)   The contribution required by division (A) shall be paid to the village
upon final plat approval, and contributions shall be made for all phases of a
development upon the approval of a final plat for any one of those phases, and
shall be used according to the needs of the residents as determined herein by
the village.
   (C)   In conjunction with any plat review and prior to any plat approval of
any developer, builder, or subdivider who is subdividing any real estate beyond

time of plat approval the contribution fee as required in division (A),
including payment for all phases of the development.

as a condition to the annexation of any land to the village; and provisions
therefor shall be incorporated in any preannexation or annexation agreement
governing such land.
    (E)   Donation to the village of land required for water detention or
retention shall not relieve an owner, subdivider or developer from the
obligation to make the land or cash contribution for public usage required
herein.
(Ord. 96-05, passed 5-6-96)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 154.115 VARIATIONS; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Administrative variations. The Village Administrator or his or her
designee may grant variations from the requirements of §
154.070, other than division (D)(3), in specific cases where good cause for
such variations is demonstrated, and such variations conform to the spirit and
intent of this chapter. Such variations are subject to such conditions as will,
in the judgment of the Village Administrator or his or her designee, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this chapter.
Such administrative variations, where granted, shall be in writing, and shall
be reported to the Board of Trustees at its next regularly scheduled meeting,
with a copy kept on file in the office of the Village Clerk.
   (B)   Other variations. The Plan Commission may recommend variations from
the requirements of this chapter other than those subject to administrative
variation in division (A) above, in specific cases of hardship, which in its
opinion does not affect the general plan or the spirit of this chapter. Such
recommendations shall be communicated to the Board of Trustees, who may approve
variations from these requirements in specific cases, which in its opinion do
not affect the general plan or the spirit of this chapter.
      (1)   Hardship. Where the Plan Commission finds that extraordinary
hardship or particular difficulties regarding the physical development of land
may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may recommend
variances or exceptions to the regulations so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest secured, provided that such variance or exception
shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter,
and further provided the Plan Commission shall not recommend variances or
exceptions to the regulations of this chapter unless it shall make findings
based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
         (a)   Public welfare protected. The granting of the variance will not
be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
         (b)   Unique conditions. The conditions upon which the request for a
variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought
and are not applicable, generally, to other property.
         (c)   Particular physical conditions. Because of the particular
physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific
property involved, a particular hardship to the owners would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations
were carried out.
      (2)   Conditions. In recommending variances and exceptions, the Plan
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objectives of the standards or requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   Procedure. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted, in
writing, by the subdivider at the time the preliminary plan is filed for
consideration by the Plan Commission. The petition shall state fully the
grounds for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.
      (4)   Recommendation. Such variance and exceptions as may be recommended
by the Plan Commission shall be forwarded to the Village Board of Trustees, in
writing, substantiating the recommended variances or exceptions. The Village
Board of Trustees may approve such variances or exceptions from the
requirements of this chapter in specific cases as listed on the final plat,
which in its opinion do not adversely affect the adopted comprehensive plan or
intent and purpose of this chapter.

replatting until required utility facilities have been installed and made ready
to service the property, and until roadways providing access to the subject lot
or lots have been constructed, or that are in the course of construction and

APPENDIX B: INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION REGARDING THE
RECEIPT OF DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS
   This agreement is made and entered into this 8th day of December, 2005, by
and between the VILLAGE OF PEOTONE, Will County, an Illinois Municipal
Corporation, an Illinois unit of local government (hereinafter "Village") and
the PEOTONE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT, an Illinois unit of local government
(hereinafter "District").
   WHEREAS, the Village anticipates a population increase due to the
subdivision and development of land within the jurisdiction of the Village; and
   WHEREAS, the Village finds that the health, safety and general well-being of
the community depends in part on the availability of competent emergency and
fire services; and
   WHEREAS, based on the foregoing, the Village, through the enactment of an
ordinance, requires that developers make land or cash in lieu of land
contributions to the Village and/or District for the purpose of constructing
additional fire station sites; and
   WHEREAS, such contributions may be in land or in money and, when transferred
or paid to the District, will inure to the benefit of the District and not
entirely to the direct benefit of the Village; and
   WHEREAS, the Village recognizes that from time to time disputes may arise
regarding the validity and amount of such contributions; and
   WHEREAS, the Village is willing, in its discretion, to seek the contribution
of land or money but wishes to procure a commitment from the District that the
District will: (a) acknowledge that the requirement that such contributions be
made is totally within the discretion of the Village as to its existence,
manner and amount; (b) be required to defend any lawsuit that is filed
challenging the legality of the ordinance/contributions, the appropriate amount
of the contributions, the time at which said contributions are to be made or
any other aspect of the contributions; and (c) comply with the terms of a final
and nonappealable judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
rendered in connection with any such lawsuit; and
   WHEREAS, the Village is willing, in its discretion, to require developer
contributions to the District only if it executes this Agreement; and
   WHEREAS, both the Village and the District, in the spirit of
intergovernmental cooperation, and pursuant to Article VII, Section 10 of the
Illinois Constitution and the Illinois Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (ILCS
Ch. 5, Act 220 §§ 1 et seq.), desire to work in accord to help collect land
and/or cash in lieu of land to defray the District's cost of meeting the new
demands placed upon it by development.
   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto do hereby
agree as follows:
   1.   The District acknowledges that, except as otherwise provided in the
Village's ordinances, the Village is not obligated to cause the payment of
money or the transfer of land to the District. The District recognizes that the
Village may, in its sole discretion, amend its ordinances to discontinue the
requirement of payment of development contributions to the District.
   2.   The District hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Village
from and against any and all loss, cost, expense, claim and cause of action of
every kind, including attorney's fees, incurred by the Village (except for acts
of intentional wrongdoing committed by the Village or its employees), as a
result of, either directly or indirectly, the adoption of an Ordinance entitled
"AN ORDINANCE ADDING A NEW SECTION
154.089 OF THE CODE OF THE VILLAGE OF PEOTONE RELATIVE TO DEDICATION OF LAND
FOR FIRE STATION SITES, OR FOR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF, FOR THE PEOTONE
FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT" (the "Ordinance"), or the conveyance of land or
contribution of cash pursuant to the terms thereof, or the administration or
enforcement thereof, or any other actions related thereto, or as a result of a
lawsuit brought or threatened by the District or anyone else, but only insofar
as such loss, cost, expense claim or cause of action is a result of the
administration of, enforcement of, or attempted enforcement of, said Ordinance,
or conveyance of land or contribution of cash pursuant thereto as it relates to
land located within the boundaries of the District. The District retains the
right to choose counsel to defend any action to which the foregoing
indemnification applies. The Village shall retain the sole right to approve or
disapprove any proposed settlement of a dispute arising directly or indirectly
under or against the Ordinance and/or the administration and enforcement
thereof.
   3.   In the event that a final and nonappealable judicial determination is
made by a court of competent jurisdiction that contributions of land or money
received by the District are, in whole or in part, excessive, the District
shall promptly repay said amount to the person who procures such a judgment,
together with all other amounts judged by the court to be owing from the
District.
   4.   The District hereby agrees that any cash contributions received
pursuant to the terms of the Ordinance shall be spent solely for land or other
improvements thereto. The District hereby agrees that in the event cash
contributions are transferred to the District pursuant to the provisions of the
Ordinance and such funds are used for purposes not authorized under said
Ordinance and this Agreement, the District shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Village from and against any and all loss, cost, expense, claim and cause
of action of every kind, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Village as
a result of such cash contribution transfer. Moreover, if the Village brings
suit against the District for any such violation, the District shall be
required to reimburse the Village for all of its expenses in relation thereto,
including its attorneys' fees.
   5.   Upon request from the Village, the District shall submit a report to
the Village describing the manner in which payments made pursuant to the
Ordinance have been used. When money turned over to District pursuant to the
Ordinance is to have been used for a specific purpose or within a specific time
period, the report shall address those issues. If the District should fail to
file such a report with the Village within 30 days of any such request, the
Village may delay the payment of any additional funds due the District until
such time as a full report containing adequate information is transmitted to
the Village.
   6.   The Village shall have the right to bring suit for the enforcement of
the terms and provisions of the Ordinance and/or to defend any action brought
in relation to the Ordinance, and shall be entitled to the recovery of
reasonable attorneys' fees in connection therewith.
   7.   The Village hereby agrees to enforce the provisions and terms of said
Ordinance for the use and benefit of the District and to make any conveyances
of land required thereunder to the District.
   8.   The District shall contract for and purchase, and continuously maintain
for the term of this Agreement, insurance, which includes Comprehensive General
Liability Insurance and Umbrella Liability Insurance on a contractual liability
basis, to fund the indemnity provided for in this Agreement. Such insurance
shall be in such amounts as mutually agreed to by the parties hereto, but in no
event shall be less than $1,000,000. The District shall furnish the Village
with a certificate of insurance by the carrier of said insurance showing the
insurance required hereunder is at all times kept in force. Each certificate
shall expressly provide that the insurance evidenced thereby shall not be
cancelable without at least ten days written notice to the parties of this
Agreement. Such certificates shall be maintained and kept current throughout
the term of this Agreement.
   9.   This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until either party
hereto shall give 90 days notice, in writing and delivered certified mail, to
the other of its desire to terminate this Agreement; provided, however, this
Agreement may not be terminated while the Ordinance, and any amendments
thereto, remains in full force and effect. The termination of this Agreement
shall not affect the continuing obligations of the District or the Village with
regard to claims or damages allegedly arising out of the Village's efforts
prior to termination to distribute or the actual distribution of subdivision
contributions.
   10.   Notice or other writings which any party is required to, or may wish
to, serve upon any other party in connection with this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:
      (1)   If to the Village:

         7550 W. Joliet Road
         Peotone, Illinois 60468
or to such other address as any party may from time to time designate in a
written notice to the other parties.
   11.   This Agreement shall not be altered or codified except by a written
agreement signed by the parties hereto.
   12.   The terms of this Agreement shall bind, and inure to the benefit of,
the parties hereto and their agents, successors and assigns.
   13.   If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid for any
reason, such invalidation shall affect no provision of this Agreement which can
be given effect without the invalid provision, and to this end the provisions
of this Agreement are to be severable.
   14.   It is expressly understood and agreed that the indemnification
covenants contained herein shall not apply to claims, demands or suits which
may arise resulting from any type of willful or criminal misconduct by the
Village, its officers or employees.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Village of Peotone and Peotone Fire Protection

OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 157.150 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this section is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of the
public streets, and so promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put.
(Ord. 77-08, passed 6-28-77)
§ 157.151 GENERAL PROVISIONS - PARKING AND LOADING.
   (A)   Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this chapter shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter, and
provided that construction is begun within one year of such effective date, and
diligently prosecuted to completion, parking and loading facilities as required
hereinafter need not be provided.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other unit of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use. However, no
building or structure lawfully erected or use lawfully established prior to the
effective date of this chapter shall be required to provide such additional
parking or loading facilities unless and until the aggregate increase in units
of measurement existing upon the effective date of this chapter, in which event
parking or loading facilities as required herein shall be provided for the
total increase.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use. However, if the said building or
structure was erected prior to the effective date of this chapter, additional
parking or loading facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the
requirements for the new use would exceed those for the existing use if the
latter were subject to the parking and loading provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking
and loading facilities which are located on the same lot as the building or use
served which were in existence on the effective date of this chapter or were
provided voluntarily after such effective date shall not hereafter be reduced
below or if already less than, shall not further be reduced below the
requirements of this chapter for a similar new building or use.
   (C)   Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in this chapter
shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or
loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings provided that
all regulations herein governing the location, design, improvement and
operation of such facilities are adhered to.
   (D)   Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming
building or use which is in existence on the effective date of this chapter,
which subsequent thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion
or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished or repaired, off-
street parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time
of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation.
However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or
loading facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent
new uses or construction.
   (E)   Control of off-site parking facilities. When required parking
facilities are provided on land other than the zoning lot on which the building
or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the
same possession or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use
to which the parking facilities are accessory. No such off-site parking
facilities shall be authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued where
the plans call for parking facilities other than on the same zoning lot until
and unless the Zoning Board of Appeals has reviewed the plans and heard the
applicant and made findings that the common ownership or possession of the
zoning lot and the site of the parking facilities are reasonably certain to
continue and that the off-site parking facilities will be maintained at all
times during the life of the proposed use or building.
   (F)   Submission of plot plan. Any application for a building permit, or for
a certificate of occupancy where no building permit is required shall include
therewith a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any
parking or loading facilities to be provided in compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 77-08, passed 6-28-77)
§ 157.152 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS - PARKING.
   (A)   Use of parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities accessory to
residential use and developed in any residential district in accordance with
the requirements of this section shall be used for the parking of passenger
automobiles owned by occupants of the dwelling structures to which such
facilities are accessory or by guests of said occupants. Under no circumstances
shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used
for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants,
visitors or customers or business or manufacturing establishments.
   (B)   Joint parking facilities. Off-street parking facilities for different
buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be provided collectively
in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each
constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements
for each use.
   (C)   Computation. When determination of the number of off-street parking
spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of one-half or less may be disregarded while a fraction in excess
of one-half shall be counted as one parking space.
   (D)   Size. A required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet
in width and at least 19 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles,
ramps, columns or office or work areas. Such space shall have a vertical
clearance of at least seven feet.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and
efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. All off-street
parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access
to a street or alley in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movements. No driveway across public property nor curb cut shall exceed a width
of 30 feet.
   (F)   In yards. Off-street parking spaces may be located in any yard except
required front yards, but shall not be closer than five feet to the lot line.

The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed was
taken.
      (2)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action

facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent
peril to life or property. In this event the proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board of

§ 157.186 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Authority. The Village Board of Trustees shall decide variations of
the provisions of this chapter in harmony with its general purpose and intent,
and shall vary them only in the specific instances hereinafter set forth where
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have made a finding of fact based upon the
standards hereinafter prescribed that there are practical difficulties or
particular hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the
regulations of this chapter.
   (B)   Initiation. An application for a variation may be made by any person,
firm or corporation, or by any office, department, board, bureau or commission
requesting or intending to request application for a building permit, zoning
certificate or occupancy certificate.
   (C)   Processing. An application for a variation shall be filed with the
Village Clerk. The Village Clerk shall forward such application to the Zoning
Board of Appeals for processing in accordance with applicable statutes of the
State of Illinois and the provisions of this chapter. No variation shall be
recommended by the Zoning Board of Appeals except after a public hearing before
the Zoning Board of Appeals, of which there shall be a notice of time and place
of the hearing published at least once, not more than 30 nor less than 15 days
before the hearing, in one or more newspapers with a general circulation within
the village, and a written notice is served at least 15 days before the hearing
on the owners of the properties located adjacent to the location for which the
variation is requested.
   (D)   Decisions. All recommendations and findings of the Zoning Board of
Appeals on variations arrived at after the hearing shall be accompanied by
findings of fact specifying the reason or reasons for recommending the approval
or disapproval of the variation, and the decision of the Village Board shall be
final and subject to judicial review only in accordance with applicable
statutes of the State of Illinois.
   (E)   Standards.
      (1)   The Board of Trustees shall not vary the provisions of this chapter
as authorized in this section unless it shall have made findings based upon the
evidence presented to it and the Board of Appeals in the following cases:
         (a)   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return
if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located;
         (b)   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances; or
         (c)   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
      (2)   A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the
judgment of the Village Board, sustains each of the three conditions enumerated
above.
      (3)   For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the Board of
Trustees, in making this determination whenever there are practical
difficulties or particular hardships, shall also take into consideration the
extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been
established by the evidence:
         (a)   That the particular physical surrounding, shape, or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved will bring
particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience
if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out;
         (b)   That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is
based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoned
classification;
         (c)   That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon
a desire to make more money out of the property;
         (d)   That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by
any person presently having an interest in the property;
         (e)   That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to
the public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the property is located; or
         (f)   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply
of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the danger of
fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (4)   The Village Board may require such conditions and restrictions upon
the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the effect of such
variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to implement the general
purpose and intent of this chapter.
   (F)   Authorized variation. Variations from the regulations of this chapter
shall be granted by the village only in accordance with the standards set out
in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances and in no
others:
      (1)   To permit up to 20% reduction in the front, side or rear yard
required by this chapter;
      (2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited
solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no event
shall the respective area and width of the lot be less than 75% of the required
area and width. The percentage set forth in this division (2) is not to be
reduced by any other percentage for minimum lot width and area set forth in
this chapter.
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities for two or more uses, provided the substantial use of such
facility by each use does not take place at approximately the same hours of the
same days of the week;
      (4)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or 20% of the
applicable regulations, whichever number is greater;
      (5)   To increase by not more than 20% the gross area of any sign;
      (6)   To increase by not more than 10% the maximum gross floor area of
any use so limited by the applicable regulations;

(Ord. 77-08, passed 6-28-77)
§ 157.189 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Purpose. The development and execution of this chapter is based upon
the division of the village into districts, within any one of which the use of
land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings or structures, as
related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique character cannot be
properly classified in any particular district or districts without
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands
and upon the public need for the particular use of the particular location.
Such special uses fall into two categories:
      (1)   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly-regulated utilities,
or uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property or public facilities.
   (B)   Authority. Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the Village
Board in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to
amendments of this chapter and the regulations and conditions set forth in this
chapter for special uses. No application for a special use shall be acted upon
by the Village Board until after:
      (1)   A written report is prepared and forwarded to the Village Board by
the Plan Commission in a manner prescribed herein for amendments to this
chapter; and
      (2)   A public hearing has been held by the Plan Commission after due
notice by publication as prescribed herein, for amendments, and the findings
and recommendations of the Plan Commission have been reported to the Village
Board.
   (C)   Initiation. An application for a special use may be made by any
person, firm or corporation, or by an office, department, board, bureau or
commission requesting or intending to request a building permit or occupancy
certificate.
   (D)   Processing. An application for a special use, in such form and
accompanied by such information as shall be established from time to time by
the Plan Commission shall be filed with the Village Clerk and thereafter
processed in the manner prescribed heretofore for applications and amendments.
      (1)   The Plan Commission shall hold the public hearing and forward its
recommendations in the form of a written report to the Village Board within 30
days following the date of public hearing on each application unless it is
withdrawn by the petitioner.
         (a)   That the proposed use at that particular location requested is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility which is in the
interest of public convenience and will contribute to the general welfare of
the neighborhood or community; and
         (b)   Such uses will not under the circumstances of the particular
case be detrimental to the health, safety, morals or general welfare of persons
residing or working in the vicinity or injurious to property values or
improvement in the vicinity; and
         (c)   The proposed use will comply with the regulations and conditions
specified in this chapter for such use, and with the stipulation and conditions
made a part of the authorization granted by the Village Board of Trustees.
      (2)   In the case of written protest against any proposed amendment of
the regulations or districts, signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% of
the frontage proposed to be altered, or by the owners of 20% of the frontage
immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners of 20% of
the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, is filed
with the Clerk of the municipality, the amendment shall not be passed except by
a favorable vote of two-thirds of all of the Trustees of the village. Any
proposed amendment which fails to receive the approval of a majority of the
Plan Commission members and is so reported, shall not be passed by the Village
Board except by a favorable vote of two-thirds of all the Trustees of the
village.
   (E)   Decisions. The Village Board, upon report of the Plan Commission and
without further public hearing, may grant or deny any proposed amendment in
accordance with applicable statutes of the State of Illinois or may refer it
back to the Plan Commission for further consideration.

(Ord. 77-08, passed 6-28-77; Am. Ord. 05-33, passed 3-27-06)
§ 157.194 SPECIAL CONSULTANTS REVIEW ESCROW.
   (A)   Whenever any review of any matter that is governed by the provisions
of this chapter requires review by outside consultants to be hired by the
village, such review will not be contracted for by the village until such time
as the applicant has deposited a sum sufficient to pay the full cost of the
consultants' services. The village will seek estimates of the cost of the
review from each of the consultants and notify the applicant of such estimates.
The applicant shall then deposit an amount equal to 110% of such estimates into
escrow with the village. Such deposit shall be by check or in cash. At the time
of receipt, the escrow amount shall be deposited in a separate fund to be known
as the consultant review escrow fund and in a separate interest-bearing bank
account. The village will then draw amounts from said escrow deposit to pay for
the services of the consultants at such time as their bills are submitted and
become due and payable. If at any time the deposit, after such draws, becomes
less than 25% of the original deposit, then the applicant shall deposit
additional funds in an amount to be determined by the village, which additional
deposit shall increase the amount in the escrow account to an amount sufficient
to pay all remaining fees anticipated to be owed to the consultants. If the
amount on deposit ever is determined by the village to be insufficient to pay
for all remaining services for the consultants, or if the applicant ever fails
or refuses to make any required additional deposits, then all reviews by the
consultants shall cease until any required additional deposit is made and the
applicant will not be entitled to any continued review of his or her
application until the additional deposit is made. Once the reviews by the
consultants have been completed and they have been fully paid for their
services, then any remaining amount on deposit, less any interest income, shall
be refunded to the applicant. The interest income shall be retained by the
village to help pay for the administrative costs of the village.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to request a refund of
the escrow fund amount and, if no such request is received within three years
from the date the deposit was made, then the village shall be entitled to use
any amount remaining in said escrow fund for general corporate purposes.
(Ord. 05-33, passed 3-27-06)
ADULT USES
§ 157.220 ADULT USES.
   The President and Board of Trustees have made the following findings:
   (A)   It is uncontested that the village may regulate, through its zoning
power, the location of sexually explicit businesses.
   (B)   Zoning, when used to preserve the character of the residential and
commercial areas of the village, is perhaps the most essential function
performed by the village;
   (C)   The village is predominately a single-family residential community
with most of the total land area of the village zoned and used for residential,
school, park, library and governmental purposes;
   (D)   The regulation of adult uses serves a substantial governmental
interest, while allowing for reasonable alternative avenues of communication;
   (E)   The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois has judicially confirmed
that the regulation of adult uses serves a valid governmental interest;
   (F)   The proposed regulations are not aimed at the content of adult
entertainment, but at the secondary effects associated with it including, but
not limited to:
      (1)   A negative impact on the real estate market where adult
entertainment is offered;
      (2)   Urban blight as a result of the decrease in property values; and
      (3)   An increase in the need for police patrols and services.
   (G)   Sexually oriented businesses in the incorporated area of the Village
of Peotone require special supervision from public safety and health agencies
in order to protect and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the patrons
of such businesses as well as citizens of the village.
   (H)   The corporate authorities and staff have reviewed studies concerning
the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other cities
including, but not limited to, "A Report on the Secondary Impacts of Adult Use
Businesses in the City of Denver", Denver, Colorado (1998); "The Adult Business
Study" conducted by the Town and Village of Ellicottville, Cattaraugus County,
New York (1998); "A Digest of Research: The Evidence of Relationships Between
Adult-Oriented Businesses and Community Crime and Disorder," compiled by the
City of St. Marys, Georgia (1996); and the "Report of the Attorney General's
Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses," Attorney
General of Minnesota (1989). Each of the reviewed studies in turn summarizes
studies from a number of other municipalities.
   (I)   From review of other cities studies and their own surveys and
testimony from its citizens there is convincing documented evidence that
sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have a deleterious
effect on both existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential
areas adjacent to them, causing among other adverse secondary effects,
increased crime and downgrading of property values.
   (J)   It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, due to their
nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are operating in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing
to crime, lower property values, urban blight and downgrading of the quality of
life in the adjacent area.
   (K)   The corporate authorities find that sexually oriented businesses are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and
sexual liaison of casual nature.
   (L)   Increased crime and unhealthful conduct tend to accompany, concentrate
around and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses, including but not
limited to prostitution, pandering, exposing minors to harmful materials,
possession and distribution of obscene materials and child pornography,
possession and sale of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons
and property.
   (M)   Concern over sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS, is a
legitimate health concern of the village which demands reasonable regulations
of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well being
of the citizens.
   (N)   The corporate authorities have considered, in part, each of the
following matters:
      (1)   Areas within close walking distance of single and multiple family
dwellings should be free of sexually oriented business uses;
      (2)   Areas where children could be expected to walk, patronize, or
frequent should be free of sexually oriented business uses;
      (3)   Sexually oriented business uses should be located in areas of the
village which are not in close proximity to residential uses, churches, parks,
schools, or other public facilities;
      (4)   The image of the Village of Peotone as a pleasant and attractive
place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented
business uses in close proximity to residential land uses, churches, parks,
schools, and other public facilities;
      (5)   Sexually oriented business land use should be regulated by zoning
to separate it from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be
separated from dissimilar uses within Peotone;
      (6)   Residents and non-residents who use the Village of Peotone for
shopping and other commercial needs, and utilize the public facilities,
churches, parks, and schools of the village will move, shop elsewhere, or use
public facilities, churches, parks, and schools elsewhere if sexually oriented
business land uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential
uses, churches, parks, schools, and other public facilities;
      (7)   Merchants in the commercial area of the village are concerned about
the adverse impact and the character and quality of the village in the event
that sexually oriented business land uses are located within close proximity to
residential uses, churches, parks, schools, and other public facilities and
that such locations will reduce retail trade to commercial uses in the
vicinity, thus reducing property values and tax revenues to the village; and
that such adverse affect on property values and business would cause the loss
to some commercial districts within the village leading to deterioration of the
commercial quality of the village; and
      (8)   No evidence has been presented to show that location of sexually
oriented businesses within the village will improve the commercial viability or
qualify of life of the community.
   (O)   Zoning, licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate
reasonable means of accountability to insure the operators of sexually oriented
businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that
minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation.
   (P)   The village recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and
minors exposed to the effects of such businesses and the deterioration of
respect for family values and the avoidance of such businesses which
necessitate children walking through or visiting in the immediate neighborhood
of such businesses.
   (Q)   There would be deterioration in the quality of businesses which chose
to operate in and around such sexually oriented businesses.
   (R)   The desire to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and
thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens, protect the
citizens from increased crime, preserve the qualify of life, preserve the
property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses,
deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from
the spread of communicable and social diseases.
   (S)   The corporate authorities have considered judicial decisions regarding
local regulation of sexually oriented businesses, including the courts'
discussions of the secondary effects of such businesses; including but not
limited to City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002);
City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatres, Inc.,
501 U.S. 560 (1991); Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976);
Joelner v. Village of Washington Park, 2004 WL 1738721 (7th Cir. Aug. 4, 2004);
R.V.S. L.L.C. v. City of Rockford,361 F.3d 402 (7th Cir. 2004); and Ben's Bar,
Inc. v. Village of Somerset, 316 F.3d 702 (7th Cir. 2003).
   (T)   Locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health,
safety, and general welfare of the people of Peotone and thus certain
requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of sexually oriented
businesses are in the public interest.
   (U)   Consistent with limitations on the sale and consumption of alcohol and
outside advertising limitations, restricted hours of operation will further
prevent the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.
   (V)   It is not the intent of this subchapter to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact content neutral
legislation which addresses the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses.
   (W)   It is not the intent of the corporate authorities to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the corporate authorities
recognize that state law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and
expects and encourages state enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity
statutes against such illegal activities in Peotone.
(Ord. 04-20, passed 9-7-04)
§ 157.221 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of this subchapter To regulate sexually
oriented businesses to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the village and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent any deleterious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within the village, thereby reducing or eliminating the
adverse secondary effects from such sexually oriented businesses. The
provisions of this subchapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials,
including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor
effect of this subchapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this subchapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

§ 158.017 GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
   It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and
sedimentation caused by development activities, including clearing, grading,
stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the village. Measures taken to
control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure
that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year
frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all development
activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions
required under §
154.006.
   (A)   Development shall be related to and consistent with the topography and
soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of
steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided
wherever possible, and natural contours are to be followed as closely as
possible.
   (B)   Natural vegetation is to be retained and protected wherever possible.
Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Temporary crossings of
watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization measures.
   (C)   Special precautions shall be taken to prevent damages resultant from
any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake,
pond, or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these
areas to erosion and sedimentation.
   (D)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed for the shortest
practical time during development.
   (E)   Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other
appropriate sediment or runoff control measures shall be installed prior to
site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters
from land undergoing development.
   (F)   The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures is to be
based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events
likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and
benefits involved.
   (G)   In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics
and the requirements of continuing maintenance are to be considered.
   (H)   Provision shall be made to accommodate the increased run-off caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways
are to be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities
and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion onsite or downstream.
   (I)   Permanent vegetation and structures shall be installed and functional
as soon as practical during development.
   (J)   Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land
uses shall be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to
development.
   (K)   All waste generated as a result of site development activity shall be
properly disposed of and shall be prevented from being carried off the site by
either wind or water.
   (L)   At all construction sites measures shall be provided to prevent
sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
   (M)   Provide a traffic control plan and construction traffic maintenance
plan through the affected development in accordance with the Millennium Edition
of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the latest
standards adopted by the Illinois Department of Transportation. Developer shall
be responsible for the cost of all permanent traffic control signage upon
village approval of the traffic control plan.
   (N)   Although excavation below final grade for the basement and footings of
a single-family residence and appurtenant structures on a site for which a
building permit has been issued by hte village is exempt from a site
development permit, erosion and sediment control measures and information shall
be shown on the building permit plat along with details and notes in accordance
with the Illinois Urban Manual (latest edition)and IEPA NPDES ILR10. Erosion
control barrier (slit fence) shall be installed at the lot perimeter. Inlet
protection (filters) shall be installed at all open lid drainage structures on
the lot or affected by construction. Any other erosion or sediment control
measures warranted by site conditions should be added as needed to comply with
the NPDES requirements. Applicable erosion and sediment control details and
notes shall be included on the permit plat for NPDES compliance.

days after receiving an application, the Building Department shall in writing:
            1.   Approve the permit application if it is found to be in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter, and issue the permit;
            2.   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this
chapter, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or
            3.   Disapprove the permit application, indicating the deficiencies
and the procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.
         (b)   No site development permit shall be issued for an intended
development site unless:
            1.   The development, including but not limited to subdivisions and
planned unit developments, has been approved by the village where applicable;
or
            2.   Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid
building permit issued by the village; or
            3.   The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any overall
development program previously approved by the village for the area in which
the site is situated; and
            4.   All relevant federal and state permits (i.e., for floodplains
and wetlands) have been received for the portion of the site subject to soil

Department may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the
specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written
application is made before the expiration date of the permit. The Building
Department may require modification of the erosion control plan to prevent any
increase in erosion or offsite sediment runoff resulting from any extension.
      (8)   Appeals. The applicant, or any person or agency which received
notice of the filing of the application, may appeal the decision of the
Building Department as provided in this §
158.018 to the Village Board. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Village Board
shall schedule and hold a hearing, after giving 15 days notice thereof to the
applicant. The Village Board shall render a decision within 30 days after the
hearing. Factors to be considered on review shall include, but need not be
limited to, the effects of the proposed development activities on the surface
water flow to tributary and downstream lands, any comprehensive watershed
management plans, or the use of any retention facilities; possible saturation
of fill and unsupported cuts by water, both natural and domestic; runoff
surface waters that produce erosion and silting of drainage ways; nature and
type of soil or rock which when disturbed by the proposed development
activities may create earth movement and produce slopes that cannot be
landscaped; and excessive and unnecessary scarring of the natural landscape
through grading or removal of vegetation.
      (9)   Retention of plans. Plans, specifications, and reports for all site
developments shall be retained in original form or on microfilm by the Building
Department.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 158.030 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PROVISIONS.
   Sections
158.030 through
158.072 govern storm water management requirements in the village.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.006, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.031 INTRODUCTION.
   All developments, regardless of size within the corporate limits or under
the control of the village, shall include provisions for the construction of
storm water drainage facilities designed in accordance with this chapter and
the Will County Stormwater Management Ordinance adopted 10/17/02 (effective
date 06/01/03). A copy of such County Ordinance is on file and is available for
public use, inspection, and examination during normal business hours in the
office of the Village Clerk. The design of all storm water drainage facilities
proposed for construction as independent projects under the control of the
village shall also meet the technical requirements of this chapter. The
requirements of the Village Subdivision Ordinance are also applicable to storm
water facility construction. In case of conflict with any part or parts of said
documents, the more restrictive ordinance, as interpreted by the Village
Engineer, shall take precedence and shall govern.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.007, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.032 GENERAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Surface flow. Surface swales/ditches described in §
158.072, shall be encouraged for use as designed in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter. Natural swales and depressional storage areas
shall be incorporated into storm water facilities design wherever practicable.
Swales and ditches, together with any underground storm sewer system, shall
provide an adequate outfall for runoff from the 100-year frequency 24-hour
duration rainstorm. In areas where swales/ditches can not be provided, the
underground storm sewer system shall be designed for the 100-year storm
condition. Where allowed by the Village Engineer, storm sewers may be
constructed to drain the development and any contiguous drainage areas. The
subdivider shall submit to the Village Engineer two copies of the storm
drainage computations.
   (B)   Storm water detention. Storm detention is required and subject to the
review of the Village Engineer. A detention pond shall have high-water level
based on a 100-year design storm and shall have an outlet which allows runoff
no greater than that for the land in its natural state prior to development.
Previously developed sites not providing storm water detention must, when
undergoing redevelopment and/or additions, provide detention meeting the
requirements of this chapter. Detention to be provided shall be for the entire
site evaluated in its natural state and shall be constructed prior to all other
improvements. This shall include mass grading and all necessary erosion control
measures.
   (C)   Drainage basin divides. The design of storm water drainage systems
shall not result in the interbasin transfer of drainage, unless no reasonable
alternative exists and there is no legal restraint preventing such transfer.
   (D)   Sump pump connections. All new subdivisions will supply a four-inch
service connection for each unit or lot in said subdivision. Upon construction
the builder will connect the house sump to the storm water connection.
   (E)   Lot grading. The location and top of foundation elevation for all
proposed structures shall be shown on the engineering drawings. Generally, the
top of foundation of any structure must be constructed at least 18 inches above
the centerline (or back of curbs) of the abutting street. Where foundations are
lower than the street centerline, or in the case of depressed driveways,
alternate means of surface drainage diversion must be shown to avoid structure
flooding. Sufficient finished grade elevations must be shown on the drawings to
ensure positive drainage away from each structure.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.008, passed 4-5-04)
DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
§ 158.045 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to public health,
safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new
development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the
inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of
downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake resources.
   (B)   The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and
impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such
this chapter regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts.
   (C)   This chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
      (1)   To assure that new development does not increase the drainage or
flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
      (2)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff;
      (3)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased
flooding on a watershed basis;
      (4)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel
erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased
stormwater runoff quantities from new development;
      (5)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources;
      (6)   To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats;
      (7)   To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in
order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce
soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational
opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.010, passed 4-5-04)

(Ord. 04-02, § 158.013.02, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.051 WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES.
   (A)   The drainage system shall be designed to minimize adverse water
quality impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall
incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. In
particular, designers shall give preference to wet bottom and wetland designs
in locations adjacent or near existing wetlands or in other areas where they
are suitable and acceptable to the village and all flows from the development
shall be routed through the basin (i.e., low flows shall not be bypassed). Dry
basins with low flow bypasses may be preferred in certain developments to
enhance multiple uses where suitable and acceptable to the village. Retention
and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff and to reduce the
quantity of runoff pollutants.
   (B)   The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where
practicable. Uses considered compatible with stormwater management include open
space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating, trails, playing
fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid
using portions of the property exclusively for stormwater management.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.014, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.052 DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS, METHODS AND BMP.
   (A)   Release rates.
      (1)   The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the
peak rate of discharge from the property for the two-year, 24-hour and 100-
year, critical duration events to levels which will not cause an increase in
flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with
other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak
discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall not be
greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge
shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained.
       (2)   Detention basin outlet design. Backwater on the outlet structure
from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the
outlet.
   (B)   Detention storage requirements.
      (1)   The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin
shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year, critical duration event. The
design of detention basins for development sizes larger than five acres shall
be by runoff hydrograph methods described below. The design of detention basins
for development sizes smaller than five acres shall be by the method described
in Section 6 of the "Investigation of Hydrologic Design Methods for Urban
Development in Northeastern Illinois," dated December 1991 prepared by the
Northeastern Illinois Plan Commission, (See Appendix C following this chapter).
      (2)   Extended detention requirement: When an existing agricultural land
use is downstream of and adjacent to a site with a proposed storm water outlet
facility, and the agricultural land is not proposed or planned for development,
the runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall event, over the hydraulically connected
impervious area of the new development, shall be managed on site in conformance
with the Will County Storm Water Ordinance.
   (C)   Drainage system design and evaluation. The following criteria are to
be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying
objective is to provide capacity to pass the 10-year peak flow in the minor
drainage system and an overland flow path for the 100-year peak flows
      (1)   Design methodologies. Major and minor conveyance systems for areas
up to five acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational
formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites.
Runoff hydrograph methods as described in §
158.015.04 must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with
greater than five acres of drainage area. All drainage system design shall be
in accordance with Part 708 Rules.
      (2)   Positive drainage. Whenever practicable, all areas of the property
must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a
stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of
the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the
minor drainage system capacity shall be provided in drainage easements, which
cannot be obstructed. Street ponding of one inch is allowed only in the
overflow path.
   (D)   Methods for generating runoff hydrographs. Runoff hydrographs shall be
developed using the soil conservation service computer model TR 20 or Pond Pack
as developed by Haestad Methods, Inc. If an existing regulatory model uses the
Corps. of Engineers computer model HEC-RAS, then that model can be used. A
continuous simulation model is acceptable only for very complex projects. No
other models are acceptable unless approved by the Village Engineer.
      (1)   Rainfall. Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage
system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the
Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 71. A critical duration analysis for the
two and 100-year storms of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hours duration shall
be prepared in accordance with generally accepted engineering principles. The
first quartile Huff rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and
analysis of detention and major conveyance systems with critical durations less
than or equal to six hours. Their second quartile Huff rainfall distribution
shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and major
conveyance systems with a critical duration greater than six and less than or
equal to 12 hours. The third quartile Huff rainfall distribution shall be used
for the design and analysis of detention basins and major conveyance system
with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The
fourth quartile Huff distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of
detention basins and major conveyance systems with durations greater than 24
hours. The first, second, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by
Huff are presented in Table 1. The rainfall data to be used for the critical
duration analysis and all other appropriate hydrologic calculations are present
as Table 2.
      (2)   Antecedent moisture. Computations of runoff hydrographs which do
not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall
assume an antecedent moisture condition of two as a minimum.
   (E)   The village endorses the utilization of the Best Management Practices
(BMP) regarding the design of a Storm Water Management System. The primary
objectives of a BMP are minimize adverse water quality impacts; preserve
beneficial natural features on-site; avoid downstream erosion and habitat loss;
maintain natural base flows and groundwater recharge; prevent increases to
downstream flooding; provide multiple uses of drainage and storm water storage
facilities; and provide for the economical, safe and aesthetically pleasing
drainage system for development. BMP methods have been published by the
Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC) under the following titles:
"Designing Stormwater BMP in Northeastern Illinois," "Urban Stormwater BMP for
Northeastern Illinois," "Restoring and Managing Stream Greenways: A Landowners
Handbook;" and Chicago Wilderness "Biodiversity Recovery Plan;" These, as well
as other sources, are recognized BMP which are to be considered in the design
of a stormwater management system.
   (F)   Wet detention basin design. Wet detention basins shall be designed to
remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as
much as feasible to be available for recreational use. A professional shall
prepare a detailed landscaping plan.
      (1)   Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least three feet deep,
excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided
they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25% of the bottom area to prevent
winter freeze-out.
      (2)   Wet basins minimum area. All ponds shall have a minimum area of one
acre at the normal water level.
      (3)   Wet basin aeration. Wet basins shall require mechanical aeration
unless waived at the discretion of the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Wetland detention basin design shall be prepared by a wetland
designer/ ecologist approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
      (5)   The planting materials for the pond side slope above the normal
water level shall be selected with consideration of survival during periods of
inundation. Planting materials will be reviewed and deemed suitable by the
village.
      (6)   Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins above the
normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than 5 to 1 (horizontal to
vertical). The side slopes below the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper
than 2 to 1 (horizontal to vertical).
      (7)   Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the
two-year event.
      (8)   Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance
between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they are
to be at opposite ends of the basin.
      (9)   Stilling/sedimentation basins. A stilling/sedimentation basin shall
be constructed at each major inlet to a wetland. The volume of the basins are
to be at least 500 cubic feet per acre of impervious surface in the drainage
area. Side slopes of the basins shall be no steeper than three horizontal to
one vertical and basin depths shall be at least three feet to minimize
resuspension of accumulated sediment.
   (G)   Dry detention basin design. In addition to the other requirements of
this chapter, dry basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available
for multiple uses.
      (1)   Dry basin design details. In order to prevent soil erosion and weed
problems, dry detention basins must be landscaped including the establishment
of a ground cover over all unpaved areas through sodding or other means which
result in a quality of ground cover comparable to that obtained through
sodding. Dry detention facilities shall be usable as active recreational areas
during dry weather conditions. Dry detention facilities must be designed so
that the cross slope is at least 2%. The bottom of the facility shall be
provided with an underdrain or low flow channel that is subject to review and
approval by the Village Engineer. The underdrain shall be a minimum six inch
diameter perforated drain tile covered on all sides with a minimum of six
inches of crushed stone conforming to ASTM C33, Size No. 67. The underdrain
shall be installed to drain the basin below grade during periods of low flow
and shall connect to a storm sewer outfall pipe. The low flow channel shall be
concrete and have a width of four feet.
      (2)   Dry detention facilities shall be designed with side slopes not
steeper than 4 to 1 (horizontal to vertical).
      (3)   Wetland and dry basin drainage. The bottom slope of all dry bottom
ponds shall be a minimum of 2%. Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used
to supplement this requirement. Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the
wet/wetland portion of the basin bottom from the dry portion.
      (4)   Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be
incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets
and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
      (5)   Wetland basin inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible,
the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If
possible, they are to be at opposite ends of the basin. There shall be no low
flow bypass between the inlet and outlet and paved low flow channels shall not
be used.
   (H)   Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or orifice
plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of 2
½inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those
specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate
self cleaning flow restrictor.
   (I)   Detention in floodplains. The placement of detention basins within the
floodplain is strongly discouraged because of questions about their reliable
operation during flood events. However, the stormwater detention requirements
of this chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood
fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met.
      (1)   Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin
in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.5 times the
volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including
any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be
controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant
shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater
conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be
opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All floodplain storage
lost below the ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the ten-year
flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood
elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All
compensatory storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and
openly to the watercourse.
      (2)   Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the
floodway only in accordance with this §
158.052.
      (3)   On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but
allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other
provisions of this chapter with respect to water quality and control of the
two-year and 100-year events from the property. If on-stream detention is used
for watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the
applicant use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase
flood elevations for any properties upstream or downstream of the property.
Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention:
         (a)   Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species,
which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for
spawning,
         (b)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water
quality or stream aquatic habitat,
         (c)   Shall include a design calling for gradual bank slopes,
appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin,
         (d)   Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of
wetlands,
         (e)   Shall require the implementation of an effective non-point
source management program throughout the upstream watershed,
         (f)   Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge, and
         (g)   Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Parts 702 and
708 and the floodplain ordinance of Village of Peotone.
         (h)   The applicant must show by a detailed engineering analysis that
onstream detention provides for all storms of critical duration water surface
elevations and discharges less than or equal to an off-stream detention basin
constructed in accordance with this chapter.
         (i)   An IDNR Dam Safety Permit shall be obtained stating the berm or
control structure meets the Class III criteria of the IDNR/DWR. If such a
permit is not required, a signoff letter from IDNR shall be provided.
      (4)   Protection of wetlands and depressional storage areas. Wetlands and
other depressional storage areas shall be protected from damaging modifications
and adverse changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land
developments. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, the
following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows
into wetlands and depressional storage areas (as appropriate).
      (5)   Detention in wetlands and depressional storage areas. Existing
wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater detention unless
it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed
modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform
beneficial functions. Existing depressional storage and release rate
characteristics of wetlands and other depressional storage areas shall be
maintained and the volume of detention storage provided to meet the
requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage.
      (6)   Sediment control. The existing wetland shall be protected during
construction by appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures and
shall not be filled.
      (7)   Alteration of drainage patterns.
         (a)   Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially
decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland.
         (b)   Detention/sedimentation. All runoff from the development shall
be routed through a preliminary detention/sedimentation basin designed to
capture the two-year, 24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before
being discharged to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed before
property grading begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy must be followed
to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland.
      (8)   Vegetated buffer strip. A buffer strip, preferably vegetated with
native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of
the wetland. The width of the buffer strip shall be 25 feet for a tributary
length of 250 feet or less. The width of the buffer strip shall be 50 feet for
a tributary length greater than 250 feet and less than or equal to 500 feet.
The width of the buffer strip shall be 75 feet for a tributary length over 500
feet. The tributary length is the maximum length of the project limits to the
wetland area or the length from a drainage divide to the wetland area.
   (J)   Streets, parking lot, and culvert drainage.
      (1)   Streets. If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major
drainage system, ponding depths shall not exceed curb heights except in areas
of 100-year overland routes and shall not remain flooded for more than eight
hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year critical duration event.
      (2)   Parking lots. No ponding is allowed on any paved surfaces. All
paved parking lot areas shall have at a minimum a slope of 1%.
      (3)   Culvert road and driveway crossings. Sizing of culvert crossings
shall consider entrance and exit losses as well as tail water conditions on the
culvert. Minimum size shall be 12-inch diameter.
   (K)   Drainage of open areas. All grassed areas shall have a minimum slope
of 1% and a maximum slope of 5:1.
   (L)   Infiltration practices.
      (1)   To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices
including basins, trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in
hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as designated by the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to recharge groundwater
shall not be located within 75 feet of a water supply well or a building
foundation. A sediment-settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse
sediment from stormwater flows before they reach infiltration basins or
trenches. Stormwater shall not be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over 80%
of a dry basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be ex-filtrated.
The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above
seasonally high groundwater and bedrock.
      (2)   Vegetated filter strips and swales. To effectively filter
stormwater pollutants and promote infiltration of runoff, sites are to be
designed to maximize the use of vegetated filter strips and swales. Wherever
practicable, runoff from impervious surfaces shall be directed onto filter
strips and swales before being routed to a storm sewer or detention basin.
   (M)   Safety considerations. The drainage system components, especially all
detention basins, shall be designed to protect the safety of any children or
adults coming in contact with the system during runoff events.
      (1)   Side slopes. The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as level as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side slopes of detention
basins and open channels shall not be steeper than six to one (horizontal to
vertical), except as allowed in §
158.052.
      (2)   Safety ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety
ledge at least 12 feet in width three feet below the normal water depth.
      (3)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall
be controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depths of
flow.
      (4)   Overflow structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be
provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing excess flows at a
stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of
the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate based on a fully developed condition of
all upstream areas.
   (N)   Maintenance considerations. The stormwater drainage system shall be
designed to minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes shall be
designed to allow lawn-mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins
shall be provided with alternate outflows, which can be used to completely
drain the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by
gravity is not feasible.) Presedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy
equipment shall be provided.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.015, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.053 ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS.
   Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered
in the design of the property's drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows
from upstream areas that are not to be detained are to be routed around the
basin being provided for the site being developed.
   (A)   Upstream areas not meeting ordinance requirements.
      (1)   When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates of
this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on
the applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant. The following
steps shall be followed.
         (a)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his or
her property using the release rates, the applicant's property area, and the
procedures described in §
158.052.
         (b)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, shall be identified.
         (c)   Using the areas determined in division (a) above plus the
applicant's property area, total storage needed for the combined properties
shall be computed.
      (2)   Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined
property areas. Storage shall be computed as described in §
158.052. If tributary areas are not developed, a reasonable fully developed
land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purposes of
computing storage.
      (3)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed the village may
choose to require oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows or minimize downstream impacts. Additional costs would be
subject to recapture by the applicant as determined by the Village Engineer. If
the applicant is the owner of portions of upstream areas recapture will not be
allowed for his share of the upstream area. The applicant's responsibility will
be limited to the storage for his property as computed in division (1)(a) above
plus any upstream property owned by the applicant. If regional storage is
selected by the village, then the design produced in division (1)(c) above
shall be implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the village, the
applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin
whenever practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his or
her basin the applicant must meet the provisions of division (1)(c) above for
on-stream basins.
   (B)   Upstream areas meeting ordinance requirements. When there are areas
which meet the storage and release rate requirements of this chapter, tributary
to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall be bypassed around the
applicant's detention basin, or be routed through the applicant's detention
basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the
applicant's property shall still be computed as described in division (A)(1)
above. However, if the village decides to route tributary area flows through an
applicant's basin, the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the
combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be
shown that at no time will the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed
the allowable release rates for his or her property alone.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.016, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.054 EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
   Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as
part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be constructed as the
first element of the initial earthwork program. Any eroded sediment captured in
these facilities shall be removed by the applicant before project completion in
order to maintain the design volume of the facilities. Gravity is not feasible.
Pre-sedimentation basins shall be included, where feasible, for localizing
sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be provided.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.017, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.055 FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION.
   The village shall have the option of requiring a fee as determined by the
Village Engineer for each cubic-foot of detention needed in lieu of the
applicant building a basin on-site provided the property will discharge
stormwater to a village approved stormwater management system with adequate
stormwater conveyance and storage capacity dedicated to site runoff from the
area containing the development.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.018, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.056 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   Maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities located on private
property shall be the responsibility of the owner of that property. Before a
permit is obtained from the Village of Peotone the applicant shall execute a
maintenance agreement with the Village of Peotone guaranteeing that the
applicant and all future owners of the property will maintain its stormwater
drainage system. The maintenance agreement shall also specifically authorize

(Ord. 04-02, § 158.020, passed 4-5-04)
DESIGN CRITERIA FOR STORM SEWERS AND SURFACE SWALES
§ 158.070 STORM SEWER.
   (A)   When storm sewer construction is permitted, storm sewers shall be
designed to flow full, using Manning's Formula with 0.013 as the roughness
coefficient unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer. If a storm sewer
is designed with a constantly submerged outfall, the sewer shall be designed
using the "hydraulic gradient" with a maximum allowable water level elevation
at the top of the street curb.
   (B)   The rational method shall be employed when computing storm runoff. The
storm system shall be designed with "positive street and swale drainage" such
that in the event of a complete storm system failure, storm water runoff will
be directed overland to the storm water detention area in a manner to minimize
property damage due to flooding. The runoff coefficient used in the rational
method shall be the weighted average for the proposed tributary watershed based
on a c-value of 0.95 for all impervious areas (paved or hard surfaced areas of
all types and buildings) and a c-value of 0.45 for all pervious areas.
   (C)   Storm sewers shall be designed to flow full and have a minimum
velocity of three feet per second and shall not exceed ten feet per second. A
ten-year storm shall be used for design purposes.
   (D)   In areas where curb and gutter and storm sewers are approved, inlets
shall be installed so that the distance between each inlet shall not exceed 400
feet and each inlet shall drain a maximum street gutter length of 400 feet.
Where the inlet is located at a low point, additional inlets may be required by
the Village Engineer. No more than two inlets shall be interconnected. Inlets
shall be so located that storm water runoff will not "pond" greater than the
top of the street curbs. Depressed street crowns to facilitate drainage will
not be permitted. A four-inch perforated underdrain tile shall be installed at
all street sag and undercut locations.
   (E)   Yard inlets shall be placed where required by the Village Engineer.
   (F)   The minimum size storm sewer shall be 12 inches in diameter, and the
minimum size inlet connection shall be ten inches in diameter.
   (G)   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Engineer, storm sewers shall
be reinforced concrete pipe conforming to ASTM C76 minimum Class III with O-
ring joints conforming to ASTM C443. All inlet connections shall be concrete
sewer pipe, ASTM C14 for extra strength pipe. Refer to Appendix D following
this chapter.
   (H)   Minimum cover shall be generally three feet zero inches for all storm
sewers unless special precautions are taken to protect the pipe, as approved by
the Village Engineer.
   (I)   All manholes, inlet manholes, inlets and catch basins, and headwalls
shall be designed in accordance with the standard details of the village. A
two-inch wide non-hardening butyl rubber mastic of minimum thickness one-
quarter of an inch shall be installed between all manhole sections and
adjusting rings for all storm sewer structures lying in pavement. All castings
shall be made in the U.S.A. with U.S.A. materials.
   (J)   Connections to sanitary sewers or existing agricultural drainage
systems (tiles) will not be permitted for any new developments. All
developments will utilize separate drainage systems to avoid disruption or
overloading of the existing agricultural tile drainage system. Any field tile
systems cut during the process of land development must be reconnected or
rerouted as approved by the Village. Connection of existing agricultural drain
tiles to new storm water management systems may be approved if proper allowance
for flows from said tiles is incorporated in the new system design.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.022, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.071 CULVERTS.
   Culverts shall meet the following minimum standards.
   (A)   Minimum pipe diameter of 12 inches.
   (B)   Corrugated metal pipe (CMP) shall be hot-dipped galvanized steel or
aluminum steel conforming to AASTO M36. Provide 16 gauge CMP for pipe diameter
21 inches and smaller. Provide 12 gauge CMP for pipe diameters 24 inches and
larger.
   (C)   Reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) shall conform to ASTM C76, minimum
Class III.
   (D)   Culvert slope and invert elevations shall match the ditch slope and
invert elevations.
   (E)   Minimum cover at driveways shall be six inches.
(Ord. 04-02, § 158.023, passed 4-5-04)
§ 158.072 SWALES/DITCHES.
   Manmade swales and ditches shall meet the following minimum standards.
Ditches and culverts may be used in lieu of storm sewers if curbs and gutters
are not required. Ditches shall meet the following minimum standards:
   (A)   Minimum grade of 2.0%.
   (B)   Maximum grade of 10%.
   (C)   Minimum depth of 24 inches below the shoulder of the street.
   (D)   Maximum bank slope of 3:1 under normal conditions.
   (E)   The bottom and banks of ditches with grades between 4% and 8% shall be
sodded and equipped with permanent ditch checks.
   (F)   The bottom and banks of ditches with grades between 8% and 10% shall
be paved or otherwise stabilized as approved by the Village Engineer.
   (G)   Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an
overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one
foot below foundation grades in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow
paths designed for flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall
be provided in drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not
exceed curb heights.
