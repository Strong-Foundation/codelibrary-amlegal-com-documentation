during the Public Participation portions of the meeting appearing upon the
Agenda for the meeting. Public Participation shall appear upon the Agenda for
each meeting and shall be conducted immediately after “Approval of the Journal
for the Preceding Meeting” and also immediately prior to the “Mayor”, unless
the City Council, by majority vote of the members in attendance, direct that
Public Participation shall be conducted at another time during the same
meeting. The Public Participation portions of a meeting shall appear upon a
meeting’s Agenda as “Visitors/Citizens Requests/Addresses from the Audience.”
Persons who do not address the Council during the Public Participation Items
upon the Agenda shall address the Council only as an Invited Speaker.
      (2)   Each person wishing to speak during the Public Participation
portion of a meeting immediately after the “Approval of the Journal for the

another speaker to increase that person’s allotted time. No speaker shall be
entitled to speak but one time on the same topic during any meeting, although a
majority of the City Council members may permit a speaker to speak more than
once if deemed necessary to permit a reasonable full and fair opportunity for
public participation
      (6)   In order to expedite Council business and to avoid repetitious
presentations, whenever any group of persons wishes to address the Council on
the same subject matter, it shall be in order for the Mayor to encourage that a
spokesperson be chosen from the group to address the Council. If additional
matters are to be presented by any other members of the group, the Mayor may
limit the number of such persons and limit the presentation to information not
already presented by the group spokesperson.
      (7)   Speakers shall address their comments only to the entire City
Council and not to an individual Council Member or the Mayor, nor to the City
Manager or a staff member, nor to the audience. Speakers are requested to be
well-mannered in their language and presentation. No speaker shall use obscene
language, fighting words, or defamatory statements. Any person who engages in

deemed out-of-order by the Mayor and their time to address the City Council at
said meeting shall be terminated.

shall respond as each deems appropriate to any comment or question of any
speaker. The Mayor, Council Member, City Manager, or other City Official may

made by a speaker; in the event of such questions or statements, the Mayor may
extend a speaker’s allotted time to compensate for the time which elapsed
during statements or questions by City Officials.
      (9)   After a verbal warning, a person who refuses to comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance regarding public participation may be directed to
cease speaking and to leave the podium, and may also be asked to leave the
meeting room; a person may be physically removed if the person fails to comply
with a request if such failure interrupts, disturbs, or disrupts the orderly
conduct of business during the meeting. In addition, any person who fails to
comply with the provisions of this Ordinance shall be subject to issuance of a
citation and fine for violation of this Ordinance.
   (D)   Closed Sessions. Public participation shall not be permitted during
any meeting or portions of a meeting which is deemed to be a closed session
under the Illinois Open Meetings Act, being 5 ILCS 120.
   (E)   Audience. Members of the audience shall refrain from applauding,
cheering, or booing during or at the conclusion of remarks made by any speaker,
staff member, presiding officer, or Council Member.
   (F)   Public Hearing. The rules applicable to the Public Forum shall
generally apply to public hearings, except that public comments shall be
limited to the matter subject of the Agenda for the public hearing and public
participation shall be for such periods of time as determined necessary by the
City Council to permit a reasonable full and fair opportunity for public
participation; during the public hearing, the time limitation of each
individual speaker shall be as provided within this Ordinance or shall be as
announced at the public hearing, but in no event shall the limitation be less
than five (5) minutes per speaker. Invited Speakers may also speak at a public
hearing.
   (G)   Subordinate Public Bodies. The rules applicable to a Public Forum and
to Invited Speakers shall generally apply to public meetings and hearings of
City Commissions, Boards, Committees, and similar subordinate bodies created by
the City Council, except that public comments shall be limited to the specific
matters subject of items appearing upon the Agenda for the meeting or hearing.
   (H)   Invited Speakers. Any citizen may address the City Council by
invitation of the Mayor or a Council Member, unless a majority of the City
Council present at the meeting denies the invitation; provided however that the
Petitioner or Requesting Party for an item upon the Agenda shall be entitled to
speak as an Invited Speaker. Participation as an Invited Speaker by non-
Petitioners or non-Requesting Parties shall be within the sole discretion of
the City Council. Persons speaking as Invited Speakers shall be subject to such
limitations as the Mayor or a majority of the City Council shall prescribe
during the meeting. In the absence of other restrictions, speakers shall be
governed by the same rules which govern speaking during a Public Forum. Nothing
herein shall prohibit someone who participated during the Public Participation
Item on the Agenda from being an Invited Speaker at the same meeting.
   (I)   Alternative Channels of Communication. In addition to speaking at City
Council meetings and other meetings subject of this Ordinance, members of the
public may communicate any concern or make comment regarding the City of Mt.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 32.001 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS.
   There is hereby created a Department of Public Works for the City of Mt.
Vernon, which shall be directed by the Superintendent of Public Works under the
supervision of the City Manager. The Department shall have jurisdiction and
control of the operation, construction, maintenance and improvement of all City
streets, sidewalks, and other public places, not including parks, sanitary
sewage systems, or water system. The Superintendent shall personally
superintend all improvements upon streets, alleys, and sidewalks of the City of
Mt. Vernon and cause all unsecure and unsafe places thereon to be repaired, and
shall cause all ordinances relating to streets, alleys, and sidewalks to be
enforced. He shall keep a record of all tools and property in his possession
belonging to the City and shall make monthly reports as to all services
performed by the department during the preceding month. He shall annually,
under the direction of the City Manager and City Engineer, prepare a program of
maintenance for all streets, alleys, and sidewalks and construction of new
public facilities for the next ensuing year.
(Prior Code, Art. 2, § 2.4)
§ 32.002 HEALTH.
   (A)   (1)   There is hereby created a Division of Sanitation within the City
of Mt. Vernon under the supervision of the City Manager and consisting of such
employees as may be necessary for the operation of the Division, provided that
the maximum number shall be authorized by the Annual Budget Ordinance.
      (2)   The City will regularly collect and dispose of garbage and refuse
of residential dwelling units within the City; provided that the City shall not
collect garbage at any place which is not within the City limits; shall not
collect garbage at any dwelling unit which is located above business
establishments which are located in the downtown area; shall not collect
garbage from any school, commercial, or industrial establishment; and shall not
collect garbage from any dwelling having five or more apartments or units.
      (3)   A monthly service charge shall be collected from each residential
dwelling unit receiving City garbage and refuse collection; for purposes of
assessing this fee, each single family residence, each apartment, each mobile
home, or each other living unit shall constitute a “dwelling unit”. The service
charge shall be in addition to any tax or other fee imposed or received by the
City for garbage and refuse collection and may be reviewed annually at the
beginning of each fiscal year. Effective May 1, 2023, the service charge shall
be $23.00 per dwelling unit per month. The charge for garbage and refuse
collection service shall be made monthly and shall be made payable 16 days
after rendition. The applicant for service, the occupants of the dwelling unit
served, and the user of the garbage and refuse collection service shall be
jointly and severally liable to pay the service charge set forth for service to
a dwelling unit. The City shall be under no obligation to furnish garbage and
refuse collection to any person who is in default as to any garbage and refuse
collection charges or to any dwelling unit occupied by a person who is in
default as to any garbage and refuse collection charges; and the City at any
time after a charge becomes delinquent shall have the full power and authority
to terminate garbage and refuse collection service; upon any charge for garbage
collection service becoming delinquent or upon a service being terminated, all
delinquent charges for garbage collection services, water services, and sewer
services must be paid in full before garbage collection service is continued or
resumed. No garbage and refuse collection service shall be provided to any
dwelling unit upon application of any person who is in default as to any
garbage and refuse collection charges due the City, no matter at which dwelling
unit said default occurred until such person has paid all delinquent charges in
full. No garbage and collection service shall be provided to any dwelling unit
occupied by any person who is in default as to any garbage and refuse
collection charges, no matter at which dwelling unit said default occurred and
no matter whether the said person is the applicant until such person has paid
all delinquent charges in full. The garbage and refuse collection service fee
shall be billable with water and sewer charges; and in the event any person
shall be otherwise entitled to a refund of a water or sewer deposit or shall
have a delinquent or billed garbage collection service charge, said charge
shall be deducted from the refund before payment of any refund or credit to
said person.
      (4)   The garbage and refuse collection service fee shall be billable
with water and sewer charges; and in the event any person shall be otherwise
entitled to a refund of a water or sewer deposit or shall have a delinquent or
billed garbage collection service charge, said charge shall be deducted from
the refund before payment of any refund or credit to said person.
      (5)   The owner or operator of each trailer park receiving garbage
service for multiple dwelling units but receiving a single billing shall on
December 1, March 1, June 1 and September 1 submit a report to the City Manager
as to the total number of occupied units and total number of vacant units
within the trailer park as of the reporting date so that the City can determine
the appropriate number of dwelling units to bill effective January 1, April 1,
July 1, and October 1, respectively. In addition, upon request by the City
Manager or his designee or agent, each owner for operator shall submit within
10 days thereafter business records and other information as may be required to
document any report of dwelling units submitted. In the event any owner or
operator refuses or fails to file the required report on the above due date or
fails or refuses to submit documentation requested within 10 days, then a
monthly service charge shall be imposed based upon the total number of dwelling
units (occupied and vacant) described within the most recent report on file or
upon such number of units as determined by the City if greater than the number
described within the most recent report.
      (6)   (a)   In the event charges, including penalty charges, for garbage
service are not paid on or before the due date of the bill for such services,
such charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent.
Thereafter, such delinquent charges shall constitute a lien upon the real
estate for which such garbage services are supplied, regardless of whether such
service has been supplied upon the application of an owner, an occupant or
other user; provided, however, that the owner of the real estate shall have no
personal liability for the delinquent charges unless said owner was also the
applicant for or user of the services giving rise to the charges. The City
Manager or the Finance Director or a designee of either is hereby authorized
and directed to file a sworn statement showing such delinquencies and claiming
such in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Jefferson County, Illinois,
after first giving seven (7) day notice by regular mail of such delinquency to
the owner of said real estate. This statement shall contain a description of
the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the City
claims a lien for the unpaid amount as well as for all charges for garbage
service subsequent to the period covered by the bill. The lien for garbage
services may be enforced and foreclosed against the premises by suit in the
Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Illinois according to the rules and
practices of said Court.
         (b)   The City shall recover all costs, including reasonable attorney
fees, incurred by the City in preparing, filing, and foreclosing the lien. The
lien may also be enforced and foreclosed by intervention in any suit already
commenced in said Court or any other Court whenever said intervention is proper
under the law. In addition, whenever the City is made a defendant in any suit
on account of any lien, it shall have for the furnishing of garbage service
full power to enforce its said lien in said proceedings. The method herein
provided for enforcing and foreclosing a lien shall not be considered as
excluding any other remedy or any other method of collecting unpaid garbage
service charges but shall be concurrent with all other remedies and methods.
The City shall recover all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred
by the City in effecting collection for garbage services or incurred by the
City in effecting or defending any remedy.
   (B)   Garbage, when used herein, shall be held to include any refuse,
accumulation of animal, fruit or vegetable matter that attends the preparation,
use, cooking, or dealing in of meat, fish, fowl, fruit, vegetables, or other
things used for food preparation.
   (C)   Garbage and refuse collection shall be subject to the provisions of §
130.21 of the Revised Code of Ordinances.
   (D)   It shall be unlawful to place ashes, chemicals, drugs, poisons, or
hazardous materials in receptacles provided for garbage or other refuse.
   (E)   All vehicles used in the collection or hauling of garbage or other
waste or refuse shall be so constructed as to prevent leakage or spillage and
fit with a cover to reduce odor and to prevent garbage, waste, and other refuse
from being deposited on public or private places within the corporate limits or
upon roadways.
   (F)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to permit
the accumulation of garbage, waste or other refuse upon premises owned or
occupied by him or to allow garbage, waste, or refuse to be carried or
deposited upon any private property or upon any street, sidewalk, alley, or
other public places within the City.

received (whether oral or written) shall be made a part of the file. Selections

are met: (1) there are complete, adequate, and realistic specifications or
purchase descriptions; (2) there are two or more responsible bidders who are
willing and able to compete effectively; (3) the procurement can be made on a
firm fixed-price contract and selection of the successful bidder can

specified in the advertisement for bids.

rejected when there are sound documented business reasons in the best interest
of the Community Development Assistance Program.
         (c)   RESPONSIBLE BIDDER refers to the character or quality of the
bidder -- whether it is an entity with which the City of Mt. Vernon is safe
doing business.

offered the City of Mt. Vernon in its bid what was asked for in the
specifications.

statements.
      (1)   The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with
more than one source submitting an offer. All competitive proposals shall be
conducted using a foinial RFP/RFQ containing at least the minimum items in the
attached RFP/RFQ Outline (See Attachment A). Architectural and engineering
services must be procured via requests for qualification statements;
administrative consulting and other professional services must be procured via
requests for proposals. Other professional services may also be procured by
requests for proposals. The following procedures will be used for competitive

accomplished.

qualification statements. Requests for proposals shall always include cost and
at least one non-cost qualitative evaluation factor.

shall review all proposals and statements received and make a technical
evaluation of each. This shall also include a written statement that identifies
the basis upon which the selection was made; including the importance of cost
(for RFPs).
         (e)   Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose
submission is deemed most appropriate to the City of Mt. Vernon with
consideration for price, qualifications, and other factors set by the City of
Mt. Vernon. Unsuccessful offerors shall be notified in writing within [ten]
working days of contract award. The notification will include a copy of the

notification shall be maintained in the contract selection file for the
individual project.

(AlE) professional services whereby competitors’ qualifications are evaluated
and the most qualified competitor is selected, at least three films will be
solicited. Following the review of the qualification statements received, the
most qualified competitor will be selected to enter into contract negotiation.

At the conclusion of successful negotiation, the competitor shall be invited to

that the costs incurred or the cost estimates included in negotiated prices are
consistent with federal cost principals[ 48 CFR Part 31].

will not assume the risk of incurring the cost to complete the task. Cost
reimbursement, unit or lump sum price, or a combination thereof may be utilized
as appropriate.
   (B)   A cost reimbursement type contract is most appropriate when the scope
and extent of the work to be performed are not clearly defined, such as a
professional services contract. A cost reimbursement contract MUST clearly
establish a cost ceiling which may not be exceeded without a contract
modification, increasing specific dollar amounts for the tasks set forth in the
existing scope of the work and in accordance with the original solicitation.
   (C)   A fixed price contract is appropriate when the scope of work is very
well defined and product oriented. A fixed price contract can only be awarded

competition and the solicitation is based principally on price. A fixed price
contract MUST establish a guaranteed price that may not be increased.

(Ord. 2025-23, passed 9-3-2025)
ATTACHMENT A
Rejection of Bids and Offers
(a)   Any bid or offer that fails to confoilu to the essential requirements of
the invitation for bids (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP) shall be rejected.
(b)   Any bid or offer that does not confoiiu to the applicable specifications
or requirements shall be rejected unless the IFB or RFP authorized the
submission of alternate bids and the supplies offered as alternates meet the
requirements specified in the IFB or RFP.
(c)   Any bid or offer that fails to confoini to the delivery schedule or
permissible alternates stated in the IFB or RFP shall be rejected.
(d)   A bid or offer shall be rejected when the bidder/offeror imposes
conditions that would modify requirements of the invitation or limit the
bidder’s liability to the City of Mt. Vernon, since to allow the IFB or RFP to
impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders/offerors. For
example, bids shall be rejected in which the bidder/offeror—
(1)   Protects against future changes in conditions, such as increased costs,
if total possible costs to the City of Mt. Vernon cannot be determined;
(2)   Fails to state a price and indicates that price shall be price in effect
at time of delivery;
(3)   States a price but qualifies it as being subject to price in effect at
time of delivery;
(4)   When not authorized by the IFB or RFP, conditions or qualifies a bid or
offer by stipulating that it is to be considered only if, before date of award,
the bidder/offeror receives (or does not receive) award under a separate
solicitation;
(5)   Requires that the City of Mt. Vernon is to determine that the bidder’s/
offeror’s product meets applicable specifications; or
(6)   Limits rights of the City of Mt. Vernon under any contract clause.
(f)   Any bid/offer may be rejected if the procurement officer deteilnines in
writing that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes
not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items
as well.
Bids or offers received from any person or concern that is suspended, debarred,
proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible as of the bid opening date shall
be rejected.
Further considerations for sealed bids:
A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from a bid
provided the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished from the
form, of the bid, or work an injustice on other bidders. A condition goes to
the substance of a bid where it affects price, quantity, quality, or delivery
of the items offered.
When a bid guarantee is required and a bidder fails to furnish the guarantee in
accordance with the requirements of the invitation for bids.
Low bids received from concerns determined to be not responsible shall be
rejected.
After submitting a bid, if all of a bidder’s assets or that part related to the
bid are transferred during the period between the bid opening and the award,
the transferee may not be able to take over the bid/offer. Accordingly, the
procurement officer shall reject the bid unless the transfer is affected by
merger, operation of law.
Notification: Any bid or offers that are rejected or otherwise excluded from
the competitive range shall be notified promptly in writing by the procurement
officer. The notice shall state the basis for the determination and that a
proposal revision will not be considered.
Record Keeping: The originals of all rejected bids/offers, and any written
findings with respect to such rejections, shall be preserved with the papers
relating to the acquisition.

(Prior Code, Art. 16, § 16.3(b))
§ 50.017 RULES GOVERNING THE USE OF CITY WATER.
   The following rules governing the use of City water are hereby adopted:
   (A)   The material used for service pipe must conform to the standards
required by the §
154.01 of the Mt. Vernon Plumbing Code.
   (B)   (1)   No person shall connect water pipe or conduct water into any two
distinct premises or tenements unless separate and distinct meter setter, angle
meter valves, and meters shall be placed for each such premises or units
served; nor shall such pipe be allowed to cross lots into adjoining premises.
All meters and angle meters valves must be located outside of any structure.
Every service pipe must be provided with an angle meter valve, so situated
outside the structure, so that the water may be shut off to prevent its
freezing.
      (2)   In the event a structure is required to have a fire suppression
system, the domestic service connection shall be within two feet of the
system’s back flow device. Said service connection shall have the meter, the
angle meter valve, and the meter pit placed in a green space located outside
the structure adjacent to said connection.
   (C)   (1)   Persons taking water must keep their service pipes connected
with mains or supply pipes, and all fixtures connected therewith, in good
repair and protected from freezing at their own expense and must prevent all
unnecessary waste of water. If it shall be found that there is an unreasonable
or unnecessary waste of water in any building, structure, or premises to which
water is supplied from the City’s waterworks system, through or by means of a
leak in any water pipe located in any such building, structure, or in or on any
premises, the Superintendent of Public Utilities may cause the water supply to
be cut off from such building, structure, or premises unless such waste shall
be stopped or shall cease within twenty-four hours after he shall have given
notice to the owner, occupant, or person in possession, charge or control of
such building, structure, or premises, to stop such waste.
      (2)   In cases where the water supply is cut off from any building,
structure, or premises on account of a neglect, failure, or refusal of any
person so notified to stop such leak, the water supply shall not again be
turned on until the cost and expense to the City of cutting off and again
turning on such water supply shall have been paid by such owner, occupant, or
person in possession, charge or control.
      (3)   Persons who shall reasonably attempt to keep their service pipes
connected with mains (i.e. from the meter to exterior of structure) in good
repair and protected from freezing and in such condition as to prevent
unnecessary waste of water and who shall suffer a water leak arising from a
concealed leak from said pipes which leak was not immediately discovered or
preventable upon exercise of reasonable alertness or diligence and which leak
was not the fault of the occupant or owner of the premises shall be entitled to
an adjustment to the water and sewer charges imposed herein for a period (a)
not greater than the billing month during which the discovery of the leak is
made and the period between the meter reading date for said month and the date
of discovery, if the leak is discovered by comparison of water usage for said
month with water usage for previous months, or (b) not greater than that part
of the billing month immediately preceding discovery of the leak, if the leak
is otherwise discovered. Provided, however, that such adjustment shall be made
only if discovery of the leak is reported and a request for adjustment is made
on or before the due date of the charges for the month during which an
adjustment is sought. The charge for water and sewer services during the month
that the adjustment is made shall be determined by adding the total water and
sewer charges for the six months prior to adjustment and dividing that sum by
six and by adding to that sum the actual costs incurred by the City for the
purchase of water from Rend Lake Conservancy District for the water usage
during the month of adjustment over and above the six-month average water
usage; if water and sewer charges for six months prior to adjustment are not
available, then the charge for water and sewer services during the month that
the adjustment is made shall be determined by estimating the charges for the
month of adjustment to be equal to the charges for the first month’s water and
sewer usage following repair of the leak and by adding to that amount the
actual costs incurred by the City for the purchase of water from the Rend Lake
Conservancy District for the water usage during the month of adjustment over
and above the estimated monthly water usage. Adjustments for part of a month
shall be made on a pro rata basis and made in accordance with the foregoing
provisions. No adjustments shall be made hereunder unless and until
satisfactory proof of repair of the water leak is presented to the Director of
Finance or his designee. In addition, no adjustment shall be made hereunder
unless and until satisfactory proof that the repair has been effected by a
licensed plumber, an owner-occupant of a single-family residence, or a lessee-
occupant of a single-family residence is also presented to the Finance Director
or his designee. Satisfactory proof shall consist of the completed work order
of a licensed plumber if applicable and a statement under oath signed by the
occupant of the real estate which contains a description of the leak, the date
of discovery of the leak, the name and address of the individual making the
repair, the date of repair, a description of the repair, the address of the
property where the repair is effected, the name of the property owner, the
names of the occupants of the property, and a statement that the repair has
been effected in compliance with all state and local regulations and
requirements. The Finance Director or his duly designated agent shall make the
determination as to whether the person requesting an adjustment is entitled to
any adjustment and, if so, the amount of the adjustment. Each person who shall
request an adjustment shall be considered to have authorized the Finance
Director or his duly authorized agent to inspect the premises, if necessary, to
assist in the determination. If any person does not agree with the decision of
the Finance Director or his duly designated agent, said person may appeal the
decision to the City Manager within five (5) days of being notified of the
decision regarding the adjustment; the City Manager shall then make the final
decision.
   (D)   No addition to or alteration whatever of any tap, pipe, watercock, or
other fixture shall be made or caused to be made by any person except through a
duly licensed plumber, and a permit first shall be obtained from the
Superintendent.
   (E)   Hydrants, taps, hose, water closets, urinals, baths, or other fixtures
shall not be kept running when not in use.
   (F)   The Mayor may at any time during an emergency, when in his judgment
the public interest requires it, prohibit the use of City water for street or
lawn sprinkling purposes, for washing cars or for fountains, for such time as
he may deem proper. No person shall so use City water during the time for which
such use shall have been so prohibited.
   (G)   In any case where the water has been turned on without the proper
application or authorization, or in any case where the water has been turned
off for any reason provided in this Article and the water is found on again, or
in any case where in the opinion of the City the turning off of the water on
the curb stop-cock or angle stop-cock is not a sufficient protection against
the further use of water, the City may take such steps as are necessary to
prevent further use of the water including but not limited to the locking of
the meter, the removal of the meter, the crimping of a supply pipe or
disconnection at the corporation cock. Upon application or re-application for
water service when the water has been so turned off by the City, an additional
charge of not less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) covering all expenses of so
turning off the water shall be imposed and said charge shall be recoverable
from the owner of the property, the applicant for the service at the time the
unauthorized water service was used, any occupant of the property or any user
of the service; until payment of the charge, no water service shall be provided
to the property, except upon the determination by the City that none of the
persons listed above nor any person associated with the unauthorized water
service is receiving any service or benefits from re-connection of the water
service.
   (H)   Where the water supply to any building, structure, or premises shall
have been cut off or stopped on account of the nonpayment of water rates or on
account of the violation of any of the provisions of this Article, or for any
reason or cause whatsoever, where such cutting off or stopping shall have been
done by the Superintendent of Public Utilities, the water shall not again be
supplied to such building, structure, or premises or permitted to be turned on
therein without a permit first issued as above provided.
   (I)   (1)   No person shall in any manner obstruct, or cause to be
obstructed, the free access of any officer or employee of the Water Department
to any hydrant of said system or to any stopcock, water meter, shutoff box or
connection with any water main or service pipe by means of any coal, lumber,
brick, building material, or by any other means, shift or device whatsoever, or
refuse or prevent free access thereto by such officer or employee whenever such
officer or employee shall desire access thereto.
      (2)   The officers, agents, and employees of the Department of Public
Utilities shall have free access to all and every part of any building,
structure, or premises to which water is supplied from the City’s waterworks
system, for the purpose of examining the water pipes, taps, and fixtures
therein or thereon, whenever such examination is deemed necessary to determine
whether there is occurring any waste of water or whether the provisions of this
Article are being complied with.
      (3)   Any person in possession, charge, or control of any such building,
structure, or premises, into which any such officer or person shall desire to
make entry or to have access for the purpose herein specified who shall refuse
to permit such entry or access or who shall do or cause to be done any act or
thing for the purpose of preventing such entry or access, shall be punished as
provided herein.
   (J)   No service shall be rendered to any premises where storm water and
sanitary drainage are not separated as required by the ordinance governing
sewers and sewage disposal.
   (K)   No water shall be turned on for service in premises in which the
plumbing does not comply with the Plumbing Code of the City; provided that
water may be turned on for construction work in unfinished buildings, subject
to the provisions of this Article.
   (L)   It shall be unlawful for any person or persons in any manner to
interfere with any main or service water pipe of the water system without first
being authorized by the proper authorities of the City, and at the same time
procuring a permit from the proper department of the City government, as
required in the ordinances of the City or any that may hereafter be passed by
the City concerning such matters.
   (M)   No person shall use or distribute, or permit to be used or
distributed, any water supplied directly or indirectly by the City, to any
person not now being supplied directly or indirectly with water produced by the
City.
   (N)   In case of making repairs or constructing new work, the City reserves
the right to shut off water without notice and keep it shut off as long as may
be necessary to accomplish such purpose or by giving such reasonable notice
thereof to its customers as shall be practicable.
   (O)   All plans pertaining to utilities shall be submitted to the Technical
Review Board for their review and recommendation at least 15 days before
presentation to the respective commission.
   (P)   All water mains shall be a minimum of 6” in size. Mains serving
residential districts shall consist of mains at least 6” in size, arranged so
they form a good gridiron. Where long lengths of pipe are necessary, 8” or
larger mains should be used. Mains should be looped if feasible.
   (Q)   In new construction, 8” or larger pipe should be used where dead ends
and a poor gridiron are likely to exist for a considerable time or where the
layout of streets are not well adapted to a good gridiron.
   (R)   In commercial districts, the minimum size main should be 8” in size,
arranged so they form a good gridiron. Twelve inch (12”) or larger mains should
be used on principal streets and for all long lines that are not connected to
other mains at intervals close enough for mutual support.
   (S)   The use of dead-end 6” mains to provide fire protection shall not be
allowed.
   (T)   Fire hydrants shall be spaced a maximum of 600’ apart in single family
residential areas.
   (U)   (1)   Fire hydrant spacing and requirements in multifamily, commercial
or industrial areas shall be determined by an evaluation of the required fire
flow for fire protection for those areas. Construction plans and data shall be
submitted to the Mt. Vernon Fire Department and for review and evaluation. The
evaluation shall be performed by the Fire Chief or his duly designated
representative. Requirements for fire hydrant spacing shall be indicated on the
subject plans during the review and evaluation process.
      (2)   The review shall include consideration of such items as type of
construction, area, occupancy, number of stories, density, special hazards,
accessibility, water supply, availability, and other factors. There shall be
sufficient hydrants installed to provide the required fire flow around any
building with no hose line exceeding 500 feet in length. The Insurance Service
Office’s “Guide for Determination of Required Fire Flow”, December, 1974
Edition, shall be used as the primary guideline for determination of required
fire flow and for fire hydrant spacing and requirements; three copies of said
Guide shall be placed on file in the office of the City Clerk of the City of
Mt. Vernon.
      (3)   Any water main or fire loop on private property used for the
purpose of fire protection shall be the responsibility of the property owner to
maintain; all maintenance, repair, and upkeep shall be the responsibility of
the property owner. However, the City shall have the authority to maintain safe
drinking water according to Illinois Environmental Protection Agency guidelines
to ensure water quality; the City to safeguard the public water supply shall
have the authority to terminate or to repair a water service having any
damaged, broken, or other water line, hydrant, or valve that poses a threat to
public health or safety; in addition, in the event that the City elects to make
a repair to any fire protection line or facility to ensure the safety of the
public, the property owner shall be liable for all costs and the City shall
bill the property owner for all cost associated with said repair; which costs
shall be due and payable 30 days from invoicing.
   (V)   Fire Hydrants shall be of Brand, Size and Specifications as required
by the Fire Chief.
   (W)   Valves shall be installed at least every 1300’ on arterial mains;
every 500’ in commercial districts and every 800’ in residential districts.
Valves may be required at closer intervals in specific situations.
   (X)   Specific locations of fire hydrants shall be determined by the Fire
Chief or his duly designated representative. The cost of fire hydrants and
installation shall be borne by the developer.
   (Y)   Water main extensions and fire hydrant installations shall be
inspected by the City during construction. Immediately upon completion, the
system shall be tested, EPA approval obtained and the system placed in service
at the direction of the City.
   (Z)   Water main extensions and fire hydrants may be installed on private
property only with the written approval of the City; for the purpose fire

City, which installation shall be subject to inspection by an authorized
representative of the City prior to the City’s furnishing water. There shall be
a $25.00 inspection fee for single-residential connections and a $50.00

payable. No existing service tap located on a vacant lot or located on any
property not having water service on or after May 1, 2018 shall be used; the
owner of said property shall be required to install a new service tap, although
the tap fee shall be waived and the new tap shall be treated as a tap
relocation.
   (B)   Each applicant for a new water service which taps or connects to a
water main extension constructed hereunder shall also pay an extension
connection charge for tapping or connecting to the water main. The extension
connection charge shall be computed by multiplying the charge per lineal foot
times the lineal front feet of the applicant’s real estate upon the extension.
The charge per lineal foot shall be determined by dividing the total cost of
construction for the extension by the total lineal footage of the extension (or
by twice the lineal footage, if the extension may serve property on either
side).
   (C)   The City may extend water mains adjacent to previously unserved
property and may collect the above extension connection charge from the owner
of the previously unserved property upon said owner’s requesting water service
for the property. The City of Mt. Vernon may also enter into a written
agreement with landowners (for the extension by the landowners) of water mains
adjacent to previously unserved land owned by a third party in order to serve
the landowner’s property; said agreements may provide that the City will
collect the extension connection charge upon the third party’s requesting water
service for his property fronting on the extension constructed by the landowner
and provided that the City will pay the charge collected to the landowner,
provided, however, that no agreement shall be executed unless the landowner
provides a verified and itemized statement of the construction costs, a plat or
description of the extension constructed by the landowner, and an accurate
record of the ownership of each property adjacent to the extension.
   (D)   Before any new connection is made, the customer shall deposit with the
City a sum equal to the connection charge, inspection fees, the extension
connection charge described above if any, and any meter deposit which may now
or hereafter be required by appropriate Ordinance of the City. After depositing
such sum, service may then be installed.
   (E)   The connection charges and extension connection charges above set
forth are only for the privilege of making connections to new water mains or to
tapping onto existing mains and do not include any costs of excavation and
installation of buildings, main services, or other costs of bringing water from
the connection or tap to the structure served.
   (F)   (1)   Immediately upon connection or tapping, the liability of the
applicant for water charges shall commence, whether the applicant shall then be
receiving water or not.
      (2)   An applicant shall not be excused from payment of monthly water
charges but shall be charged at least the minimum amount even though he shall
choose not to receive water immediately.
   (G)   In the event that the City installs a water main in a previously
unserved area within the corporate limits of the City of Mt. Vernon, each
property adjacent to the main shall, within 90 days, connect to the City water
system; said connection shall be at the owner’s expense and shall be subject to
all new connection permits, rules and fees.

   (A)   In the event charges, including penalty charges, for water service or
sewer service are not paid on or before the due date of the bill for such

sewer main extension constructed hereunder shall also pay an extension
connection charge computed by multiplying the charge per lineal foot times the
lineal front feet of the applicant’s real estate upon the extension; the charge
per lineal foot shall be determined by dividing the total cost of construction
for the extension by the total lineal footage of the extension (or by twice the
lineal footage if the extension may serve property on either side). Relocation
of an existing service shall not constitute a new sewer service, and no
connection charge shall be payable; although the inspection fee shall be
payable.
   (C)   The City may extend sewer mains adjacent to previously unserved
property and may collect the above extension connection charge from the owner
of the previously unserved property upon said owner’s requesting sewer service
for the property. The City of Mt. Vernon may also enter into written agreements
with landowners for the extension by the landowner of sewer mains adjacent to
previously unserved land owned by a third party in order to serve the
landowner’s property; said agreements may provide that the City will collect
the above described lineal foot extension connection charge upon the third
party’s requesting water service for his property fronting on the privately
developed main extension and provided that the City will pay the lineal foot
extension connection charge collected to the landowner, provided however that
no agreement shall be executed unless the landowner provides a verified and
itemized statement of the construction costs, a plat or description of the
extension constructed, and an accurate record of the ownership of each property
adjacent to the extension.
   (D)   The term, DWELLING UNIT shall be defined to mean each premises served

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 51.001 SCOPE AND PURPOSE.
   The scope and purpose of this Ordinance is to aid in the prevention of
sanitary sewer blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulations
of fats, oils, greases and other substances into the sanitary sewer system from
industrial or commercial establishments or other users, particularly food
preparation and serving facilities, as the discharge of fats, oils, greases and
other substances into the sanitary sewer system interfere with the operations
of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines, interfere with normal
operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute waste of a strength or
form that is beyond the treatment capability of the sewer treatment plant.
(Prior Code, Art. 16A)
§ 51.002 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE.
   Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no user shall discharge any
water or wastewater containing non-emulsified fats, wax, grease or oils, in
excess of one-hundred parts per million by weight (100 mg/L) or containing any
substance which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32° and
150° Fahrenheit.
(Prior Code, Art. 16A, § IA)
§ 51.003 SOLVENTS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   The use of degreasing or line cleaning products containing petroleum
based solvents, or containing any solvent, caustic, or acid which dissolves
grease or containing any enzyme or any chemical or other agent which dissolve
grease is prohibited, regardless of whether same is added directly into the
grease trap or grease interceptor or same is added to floor drains or other
kitchen fixtures. All such solvents are also prohibited for use with any oil
and water separator or other separator.
   (B)   Bacteria or other microbial agents which contain no other prohibited
agent may be used only if such agent does not interfere with the performance of
the grease trap or grease interceptor. The use of such agents is prohibited if
there is any sign that the use of the agent is interfering with the grease
trap’s or grease interceptor’s performance. Prima facie signs of such
interference include:
      (1)   The use of any such agent is accompanied by an emulsification of
oil and/or grease in the grease trap that causes a shift in the consistency of
the grease contents from a stratified layer with a dense greasy crust on top to
an almost uniform pancake batter-like consistency.
      (2)   The use of any such agent is accompanied by an accumulation of
grease or the appearance of free-floating oil or grease downstream of the
grease trap.
      (3)   The use of any such agent is accompanied by any end-of-pipe grab
sample result for fats, oils and greases above the instantaneous maximum
concentration limit of 100 mg/L.
    (C)   Any user utilizing bacteria or microbial agent shall remain
responsible for not exceeding the established oil and grease numerical limit
and responsible for maintaining an effective volume of the interceptor or
separator. Any user utilizing biological additives must notify the City not
less than 30-days prior to such use and must provide the manufacturer’s
Material Safety Data Sheets, and submit a report with product name, quantity
purchased, date purchased, and dosage to be used for such additives. In
addition, during all periods of use, a maintenance record of the use of such
agent must be maintained showing the date and dosage each time an additive is
used. The exclusive use of biological additives is not an acceptable grease
management or maintenance practice. Bacteria or microbial agents shall not be
employed as the sole method of treating or maintaining a grease trap’s or
interceptor’s effluent. The use of any bacteria or microbial agent shall not
excuse compliance with each and every other provision of this Ordinance,
including the installation and maintenance of the required grease interceptor
or trap and all provisions relating thereto.
(Prior Code, Art. 16A, § IB)

   (A)   Grease interceptors required under this Ordinance shall be installed
unless the City Building Inspector authorizes the installation of a grease trap
or other alternative pre-treatment technology after determination that the
installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible. The user bears the burden
of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor in not feasible.
The City Building Inspector may authorize the installation of a grease trap
where the installation of a grease interceptor is not possible due to physical
barriers, physical constraints, space constraints or other considerations not
within control of user and not subject to feasible correction or remedy.If an
establishment believes the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible
because of documented space constraints, a written request for a grease trap or
alternate grease removal device shall contain the following information:
      (1)   Location of sewer main and easement in relation to available
exterior space outside building; and
      (2)   Existing plumbing at or in a site that uses common plumbing for all
services at that site.
   (B)   Alternate pre-treatment technology includes but is not limited to
devices that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and
prevent it from being discharged into the sanitary sewer collection system.
   (C)   (1)   A user of an existing structure subject to the provisions of
this Ordinance which is not a cooking establishment and which demonstrates that
the discharge from its food service and/or preparation activities contain less
than 100 mg/L of grease may receive a variance from minimum sizing requirements
or installation and maintenance requirements.
      (2)   The sampling and testing to demonstrate the concentration of grease
in the discharge must be conducted annually at times selected by City, all at
the user’s expense, by an independent testing organization and measured in
accordance with the analytical test procedures established in 40 C.F.R. 136 as
amended from time to time.
   (D)   No variance shall be granted to any new construction. Each user
granted a variance shall implement and comply with Best Management Practices to
the extent that same are applicable to user’s activities. Variances are not to
be liberally granted and shall be denied absent strict compliance with variance
requirements.
   (E)   (1)   The user seeking the variance shall submit a written request to
the City Building Inspector, which written request shall include sufficient
technical data provided by the manufacturer of the grease trap or alternate
pre-treatment technology, including but not limited to capacity, operation and
maintenance so as to permit a thorough review of the request for variance.
      (2)   Granted variances shall be valid only for the use proposed by the
user and the variance shall be non-transferable. The variance shall be rendered
null and void in the event of the transfer of ownership of the user’s
establishment or any change in the methods of operation by user.
      (3)   Failure to strictly implement and comply with Best Management
Practices shall also render a variance null and void.
(Prior Code, Art. 16A, § IIC)

§ 51.019 GREASE INTERCEPTOR AND TRAP CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   A grease interceptor or trap shall be considered to be at its maximum
level and shall not be considered operative if the grease layer and solids
(sludge pocket) combined measures 50% of the depth of the interceptor or trap;
a grease interceptor or trap shall be considered in operating condition only if
the combined measurement of the grease layer and solids is less than 50% of the
total interior depth measurement of the interceptor or trap. In no event shall
the grease layer extend below the bottom of the effluent tee regardless of the
depth of the grease layer.
   (B)   All grease interceptors and grease traps shall be routinely and
regularly cleaned and inspected to insure proper operation. If the grease level
is at its maximum, the grease interceptor or trap shall be immediately cleaned
or discharge into same shall be prohibited. If any grease interceptor or trap
is determined to be at its maximum upon inspection then cleaning frequencies
shall be increased. A grease trap or interceptor is recommended to be cleaned
when the grease layer and solids combined measure 30% of the depth of the
grease interceptor or trap.
   (C)   The on-duty manager of user must witness all cleaning of grease traps
and interceptors to insure that the cleaning is performed completely and
properly. To properly clean a grease interceptor the entire contents must be
removed, including grease layer cap (floating grease) and sludge pocket
(settled solids); failure to remove the sludge pocket (settled solids) from the
bottom will result in lower capacity and reduced detention. The manager must
also be sure removable baffles are replaced after cleaning.
   (D)   Grease interceptors shall be cleaned by removing the grease layer,
solids layer, and water; the sides and bottom of the grease interceptor shall
be cleaned with a scraper and all tees, baffles, and the bottom shall be
inspected for problems. All water shall be removed from the grease interceptor
and shall be replaced with clean water and no water which has been skimmed or
pumped from the grease interceptor or from any other grease interceptor shall
be reintroduced back into the grease interceptor. Separator trucks which pump
the contents of the grease trap into the truck, separate the water layer from
the fats, oil and grease and then returns water into the grease trap are
prohibited.
   (E)   The grease interceptors during maintenance must be inspected and great
care must be taken to insure that the baffles are in place and properly
positioned.
   (F)    The cover of the grease interceptor must fit properly so it does not
leak. All in-ground interceptors should be examined for cracks which could
allow wastewater to leak out or groundwater to leak in.
   (G)   Maintenance and cleaning records shall be kept in strict accordance
with §
51.020 below.
   (H)   Upon any grease interceptor or grease trap being inspected by the City
and upon it being determined that the grease interceptor or trap shall be at
its maximum level the user shall be immediately subject to all remedies
provided within §§
51.095 through
51.099 of this Ordinance.

      (3)   To protect both Publicly Owned Treatment Works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
and
      (6)   To enable Mt. Vernon to comply with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal
requirements, and any other Federal or State laws to which the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works is subject.
   (B)   This ordinance shall apply to all users of the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works. The ordinance authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge
permits; provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and

paragraph.
   NONCONTACT COOLING WATER. Water used for cooling which does not come into
direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste product, or
finished product.
   PASS THROUGH. A discharge of pollutant which cannot be treated adequately by
the POTW and therefore exits the POTW into waters of the United States in

   (A)   At least once every two (2) years, the City Manager shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug
control plan. The City Manager may require any user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the City Manager may
develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan
shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the City Manager of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
52.095 of this ordinance; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (B)   Each industrial user having the ability to cause pass through or
interference with the POTW Treatment Facility or to violate the regulatory
provisions of this ordinance shall provide protection from accidental discharge
to the POTW of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
ordinance. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials
shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user’s own cost and expense.
   (C)   All industrial users whose wastewater includes or could include
compatible or incompatible pollutants in amounts great enough to cause pass
through or interference with the POTW must have detailed plans on file at the
POTW showing facilities and operating procedures to provide protection from
accidental discharge. All industrial users shall complete construction of said
facilities by 180 days from the effective date of this ordinance. No industrial
user who begins contributing to or could contribute such pollutants to the POTW
after the effective date of this ordinance shall be permitted to introduce such
pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge facilities and procedures,
as appropriate, have been approved by the POTW and installed by the industrial
user. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this ordinance.

   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the City Manager a report containing the information described in §
52.090(B) of this ordinance. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits; established in accordance with the procedures in 40
C.F.R. 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s
long term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the user’s actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §
52.054 of this ordinance.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.3)

All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
§
52.054 of this ordinance.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (C)   If a user, subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the City Manager, using
the procedures prescribed in §
52.100 of this ordinance, the results of this monitoring shall be included in
the report.
   (D)   Monitoring shall be as follows:
      (1)   Significant Industrial Users shall provide and operate at the
Significant Industrial User’s own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal
drainage systems. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the
user’s premises but the POTW may, when such a location would be impractical and
cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area land located so that it will not be obstructed
by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user.
      (2)   Where required by the POTW, additional control manholes or sampling
chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an
industrial user’s facility suitable for the determination of compliance with
Pretreatment Standards.
      (3)   Whenever required by a wastewater discharge permit, any Significant
Industrial User shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each
separate discharge in the building sewer in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by the POTW, installed and maintained at all times at
the user’s expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to
permit the POTW to take accurate composite samples for analysis. The chamber
shall be safely, easily and independently accessible to authorized
representatives of the POTW at any time.
         (a)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a Palmer Bowlus flume unless
a weir or similar device is approved by the POTW with a recording and
totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity; or at the
discretion of the POTW the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be
used as the liquid quantity where it is substantiated to the POTW that the
metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where
a measurable adjustment agreed to by the POTW is made in the metered water
supply to determine the liquid waste quantity.
         (b)   When required, samples shall be taken every hour or half hour,
as determined by the POTW and properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance
with 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and shall be composited in proportion to the flow for a
representative 24 hour sample. Such sampling shall be done as prescribed by the
user’s wastewater discharge permit.
         (c)   The sampling chamber, metering device, and documentation of the
frequency of sampling, sampling methods and analyses of samples shall be
subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection and verification by the POTW.
      (4)   Whenever required by a wastewater discharge permit, the permittee
shall pay the costs of sampling of its discharge and the costs of analyses of
its samples, whether or not the sampling and analyses are done by the permittee
or by the POTW.
      (5)   All measurements, tests, and analyses to which reference is made in
this ordinance shall be determined and performed in accordance with the
procedures established by the Administrator of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (hereafter “Administrator”) pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act,
being 33 U.S.C. § 1314(g), and contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments
thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator.
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
Administrator. Where 40 C.R.F. Part 136 does not include sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the Administrator
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and
analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other
parties, approved by the Administrator.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.4)
§ 52.094 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   Each user must notify the City Manager of any planned significant changes to
the user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least thirty (30) days before the change.
   (A)   The City Manager may require the user to submit such information as
may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §
52.053 of this ordinance.
   (B)   The City Manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §
52.055 of this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under §
52.075 of this ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated
changed conditions.

   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the
incident. This notification shall include the name of caller, the location and
time of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the City Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance. Failure to
report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other
remedies available to the POTW, result in the revocation of the discharger’s
wastewater discharge permit.
   (C)   A notice in English or the language of common use shall be permanently
posted on the user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (A), above.
Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to
occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
includes the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than
one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must
be submitted under §
52.094 of this ordinance. The notification requirement in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self monitoring requirements of §§
52.090, 52.092, and 52.093 of this ordinance.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (A), above,
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15)
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA, being 42
U.S.C. § 6921, identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or
listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
City Manager, the EPA Region 5 Land, Chemicals and Redevelopment Division
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.9)
§ 52.099 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40
C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by EPA.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.10)
§ 52.100 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in Section (B), below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques. In the event 24-hour flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
City Manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum
of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (C)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of the
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.11)
§ 52.101 TIMING.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.12)
§ 52.102 RECORD KEEPING.
   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance and
any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records
shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name
of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the
results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of
at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the
duration of any litigation concerning the user or Mt. Vernon, or where the user
has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the City
Manager.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 6.13)
§ 52.103 CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS.

safety and welfare of the community, then the City Manager may seek issuance of
a search warrant from the Circuit Court of Jefferson County.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 7.2)
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
§ 52.130 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (A)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the City Manager’s inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the City Manager, that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at
the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and
demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be
held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater

discharge permit or seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from
discharging to the POTW.
      (2)   The City Manager may also, upon discovering an ongoing or potential
discharge to the POTW which presents or may present a danger to the health or
welfare of persons, to the environment or causes interference with the
operation of the POTW, issue a Show Cause Order to the user to appear at a
Hearing before the City Council to show cause why the POTW should not
disconnect service, revoke or suspend the user’s wastewater discharge permit or
seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from discharging to the POTW.
   (B)   The Show Cause Order shall specify the time and place for the Show
Cause Hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action,
and the purpose of the Hearing (i.e. to allow the user to show cause why such
action should not be taken). The Show Cause Order shall be served personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five (5)
days prior to the scheduled date of the Show Cause Hearing. The Show Cause
Order may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A Show Cause
Hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
   (C)   Procedures to be followed by the City Council in said show cause
hearing shall be in accordance with §
52.167(B) of this ordinance. After said hearing, the POTW may disconnect

the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified
time.
      (2)   If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
   (B)   (1)   Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address
the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer.
      (2)   A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance
established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance
order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 10.4)
§ 52.164 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   (A)   When the City Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to

   (A)   Conditions for Immediate Disconnection of Service. Any industrial user
is subject to immediate disconnection of service under either of the following
conditions:
      (1)   Whenever immediate disconnection is required to halt or prevent any
discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to the City
Manager to present or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to
the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or causes interference
with the operation of the POTW; or
      (2)   Whenever the industrial user’s wastewater discharge permit is
revoked.
   (B)   Procedures for Immediate Disconnection.
      (1)   Notwithstanding §§
52.160 through
52.167 of this ordinance, the City Manager shall have the authority, after
informal notice to the industrial user, to immediately and effectively halt or
prevent any discharge of pollutants to the POTW that reasonably appears to the
City Manager to present or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or causes interference
with the operation of the POTW. When the City Manager determines that such an
emergency situation exists, he shall issue a verbal order (followed immediately
by a written order) to the industrial user stating the problem and requiring
immediate cessation of the discharge. The City Manager’s action may include
disconnection of wastewater collection service. The City Manager shall obtain
the concurrence of the POTW attorney before initiating action. Methods of
informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following:
personal conversation between the industrial user and POTW employees, telephone
calls, letters, hand delivered messages or notices posted at the industrial
user’s premises or point of discharge.
   (C)   Procedures for Elimination of Discharge and Reinstatement.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City
Manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate blockage
or severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The City
Manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Manager that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
52.166 of this ordinance are initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, or causes interference with the operation of the
POTW shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence,
to the City Manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing
under §§
52.162 or
52.166 of this ordinance.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

§ 52.183 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this ordinance shall not be exclusive. The City
Manager may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with Mt. Vernon’s Enforcement Response Plan. However, the City
Manager may seek whatever remedies are authorized by statute, at law or in
equity against any person or industrial user violating the provisions of this
ordinance. Further, the City Manager is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
   (A)   In addition to remedies available to the POTW set forth elsewhere in
this ordinance, if the POTW is fined by the State of Illinois or USEPA for
violation of the POTW NPDES permit or violation of water quality standards as
the result of discharge of pollutants, then the fine, including all the POTW
legal, sampling analytical testing costs and any other related costs shall be
charged to the responsible industrial user. Such charge shall be in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the POTW may have under this
ordinance, statutes, regulations, at law or in equity.
   (B)   (1)   If the discharge from any industrial user causes a deposit,
obstruction or damage to any of the POTW wastewater facilities, the POTW shall
cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to
be promptly repaired.
      (2)   The cost for such work, including material, labor and supervision,
shall be borne by the person or industrial user causing such deposit,
obstruction, or damage.
   (C)   In addition to any penalty levied under §§
52.180 through
52.183, the POTW may, where the circumstances of the particular case so
dictate, seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from discharging into the
sanitary sewer system, or to provide such other affirmative relief as may be
appropriate.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 11.4)
SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION

submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore
or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 12.2)
§ 52.197 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
   Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be
severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has
satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 12.3)
§ 52.198 PUBLIC NUISANCES.
   A violation of any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or
abated as directed by the City Manager. Any person creating a public nuisance
shall reimburse the City of Mt. Vernon for any costs incurred in removing,
abating, or remedying such nuisance, and shall be subject to the general
provisions of §
90.11 of the Revised Code of Ordinances of the City of Mt. Vernon, including
the provision for a lien upon real estate as described therein.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 12.4)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 52.210 UPSET.
   (A)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of paragraph (B) below, are met.
   (B)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the City
Manager within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset and if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Prior Code, Art. 16B, § 13.1)
§ 52.211 BYPASS.
   (A)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of paragraphs (B) and (C) of this section.
   (B)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the City Manager, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the City Manager of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City Manager may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within
twenty-four (24) hours.
   (C)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the City Manager may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of
this section. (2) The City Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the City Manager determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section.

§ 53.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce the hazard to public health
and safety caused by excessive storm water runoff, to enhance economic
objectives, and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of
land and water resources within the regulatory area. This ordinance regulates:
      (1)   Storm water drainage improvements related to development of lands
located within the corporate limits of the City and all areas within one and
one half (1/2) miles of the corporate limits as existing now or in the future.
      (2)   Drainage control systems installed during new construction and
grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (3)   Erosion and sediment control systems installed during new
construction of grading of lots and other parcels of land.
      (4)   The design, construction and maintenance of storm water drainage
facilities and systems.
      (5)   Existing storm water drainage systems where the inclusion of
improvements is feasible.
   (B)   (1)   It is recognized that drainage systems serving the City of Mt.
Vernon and adjacent areas may not have sufficient capacity to receive and
convey storm water runoff resulting when land changes from open or agricultural
use to a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that deposit of sediment
from developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm
sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving lakes and
streams.
      (2)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the City Council that the
storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of all
new development, any redevelopment and other new construction in the regulated
areas as stipulated elsewhere in this Ordinance. The release rate of storm
water from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the land area
in its undeveloped state.
   (C)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for
storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for storm drainage
tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is recommended that each
proposed project be discussed with the City Engineer’s office at the earliest
practical time in the planning stage.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-1)
§ 53.02 CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.
   The provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed as additional requirements
to minimum standards required by other ordinances of the City. In the case of
conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-2)
§ 53.03 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.
   In addition to the requirements of this ordinance, compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mt. Vernon and
other applicable ordinances with respect to submission and approval of
preliminary and final subdivision plats, improvement plans, building and zoning
permits, construction inspections, appeals, and similar matters, and compliance
with applicable State of Illinois statutes and regulations shall be required.

permanent pool of water after having provided its planned detention of runoff
during a storm event.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-4)
§ 53.05 STORM WATER CONTROL POLICY.
   (A)   It is recognized that the smaller streams and drainage channels
serving the City of Mt. Vernon may not have sufficient capacity to receive and
convey storm water runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly,
the storage and controlled release rate of excess storm water runoff shall be
required for any development, redevelopment and new construction located within
the regulated area not exempt under this ordinance. No improvement location
permit shall be issued for the construction or extension of any proposed or
existing building in the regulated area until the required drainage plans have
been approved in writing by the Council, except for the following exemptions:
      (1)   Construction or extension of a single family dwelling house or an
extension of a single family dwelling house or an accessory use building
thereto;
      (2)   Construction or extension of a duplex dwelling house or an
accessory use building thereto;
      (3)   Construction or extension in that area of the City designated
Primary Business District (B-1 Zoning Classification); or
      (4)   Construction, extension or replacement of a building or buildings
on a site of 20,000 square feet or less.
      (5)   Extension or replacement of any existing building that does not
increase the existing rate of runoff.
   (B)   The exceptions (A)(1) through (A)(5) above, however, shall not be
applicable to a project if located in a previously designated Impact Area as
established per §
53.18 of this ordinance.
   (C)   The release rate of storm water from development, redevelopment, and
new construction, as stipulated above, may not exceed the peak rate of runoff
from the land area in its undeveloped state. The developer must submit to the
Council, detailed computations of runoff before and after development,
redevelopment or new construction. These computations must show that the peak
runoff rate after development, redevelopment, or new construction, for the 10
year and 100 year return period of critical duration must not exceed the
undeveloped peak runoff rate for either return periods. The computation method
used in determining storm water runoff for land areas up to and including 5
acres may be the “Rational Method.” Other proven hydrograph techniques and/or
computer drainage modeling methods may be used for determining storm water
runoff for both areas smaller and larger than 100 acres.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-5)
§ 53.06 PERMITS FOR CONSTRUCTION IN THE FLOODWAY.
   (A)   (1)   The State of Illinois requires U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,

professional engineer or land surveyor engaged in storm drainage design shall
be submitted to the Council at the time of application for 1) each proposed
major subdivision or planned development lying within the Regulated Area prior
to Final Plat approval by the Planning Commission, or 2) a building permit for
any development, redevelopment, or new construction on real estate which lies
within the Regulated Area which has not previously received drainage approval
or is not exempt from the requirements of this Ordinance.
   (A)   Topographic and Soils Maps. A topographic map of the land to be
developed and such adjoining land whose topography may affect the layout or
drainage of the development. The contour intervals shall be one foot when
slopes are less than four percent and shall be two feet when the slope exceeds

(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-7)
§ 53.08 DETERMINATION OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.
   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development. The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a given
rainfall intensity may be calculated as follows:
   (A)   Areas up to and Including 100 Acres.
      (1)   For areas up to and including one hundred (100) acres and for sites
with no depressional storage, the Rational Method may be used. In the Rational
Method, the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic feet per second is computed as:
Q = CIA, where
C = runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the drainage area
and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall.
I = average intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to
the time of concentration (tc) for a selected rainfall frequency.
A = tributary drainage area in acres.
      (2)   Guidance to the selection of the runoff coefficient “C” is provided
by Table 1 and Table 1A which show values for different types of surface and
local soil characteristics. The composite “C” value used for a given drainage
area with various surface types shall be the weighted average value for the
total area calculated from a breakdown of individual area having different
surface types.
      (3)   Table 2 provides runoff coefficients and inlet times for different
land use classifications. In the instance of undeveloped land situated in an
upstream area, a coefficient or coefficients shall be used for this area in its
present or existing state of development.
      (4)   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the rainfall frequency
curves shown in Figure 1 or from data shown in Table 5A. The time of
concentration (tc) to be used shall be the sum of the inlet time and flow time
in the drainage facility from the most remote part of the drainage area to the
point under consideration. The flow time in the storm sewers may be estimated
by the distance in feet divided by velocity of flow in feet per second. The
velocity shall be determined by the Manning formula.
      (5)   Inlet time is the combined time required for the runoff to reach
the inlet of the storm sewer. It includes overland flow time and flow time
through established surface drainage channels such as swales, ditches and sheet
flow across such areas as lawns, fields, and other graded surfaces. It may be
computed by using Figure 2.
   (B)   Areas in Excess of 100 acres. The runoff rate for area in excess of
100 acres shall be determined by methods described in §
53.15(G).
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-8)
§ 53.09 AMOUNT OF RUNOFF TO BE ACCOMMODATED BY VARIOUS PARTS OF DRAINAGE
FACILITY.
   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows:
   (A)   Minor Drainage System.
      (1)   The minor drainage system such as inlets, catch basins, street
gutters, swales, sewers and small channels which collect storm water (runoff)
must accommodate peak runoff from a 10 year return frequency storm. Duration,
for sizing these conveyances, using the rational method shall be equal to the
time of concentration. The Rational Method is acceptable for storm sewer
design, as long as the TR-55 time of concentration methodology is used.
Determination of hydraulic capacity for storm sewers sized by Rational Method
analysis should be done using Manning’s Equation.
      (2)   When using the HEC-1, TR-20 or comparable computer program, the
design should use the Huff First Quartile (50%) rainfall distribution with no
greater than a one hour storm duration; however, these minimum requirements
must be satisfied:
         (a)   The allowable spread of water on Collector Streets is limited to
maintaining two clear 10 foot moving lanes of traffic. One lane is to be
maintained on Local Roads, while Places can have a water spread equal to one
half of their width.
         (b)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic feet per
second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50 year return
period storm within the drainage easement.
         (c)   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff from a 50
year return frequency storm when crossing under roads which are part of the
functional classification and are classified as primary or secondary arterial
streets.
   (B)   Major Drainage Systems. Major drainage systems are defined in §
53.04, and shall be designed in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Illinois Department of Natural Resources Office of Water Resources, and
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Standards as described in §
53.06.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-9)
§ 53.10 LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR URBAN AREAS.
   First floor elevations of all buildings shall be such that all floors
including basements shall have two feet of free board above the 100 year flood
elevation or at the flood protection grade.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-10)
§ 53.11 STORM SEWER DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All storm sewers, whether private of public, and whether constructed on
private or public property shall conform to the design standards and other
requirements contained herein.
   (A)   Manning Equation.
      (1)   The hydraulic capacity of storm sewers shall be determined using
Manning’s Equation:
V = (1.486/n )(R 2/3)(s 1/2), where
V = mean velocity of flow in feet per second
R = the hydraulic radius in feet, A/P, cross sectional area / wetted perimeter
s = the slope of the energy grade line in feet per foot
n = roughness coefficient
      (2)   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross sectional area of
flow divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted perimeter. Typical “n” values
and maximum permissible velocities for storm sewer materials are listed in
Table 3. Roughness coefficients (n) values for other sewer materials can be
found in standard hydraulics texts and references.
   (B)   Minimum size. The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be 12 inches.
Rate of release for detention storage shall be controlled by an orifice plate
or other devices, subject to approval of the Council, where the 12 inch pipe
will not limit rate of release as required.
   (C)   Grade. Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum of two
feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less than the
minimum may be used only upon approval of the Council. Uniform slopes shall be
maintained between inlets, manholes and inlets to manholes. A minimum drop of
0.1 foot through manholes and inlets should be provided. Final grade shall be
set with full consideration of the capacity required, sedimentation problems
and other design parameters. Minimum and maximum allowable slopes shall be
those capable of producing velocities of two and one half and 15 feet per
second, respectively, when the sewer is flowing full.
   (D)   Alignment. Storm sewers shall be straight between manholes insofar as
possible. Where long radius curves are necessary to conform to street layout,
the minimum radius of curvature shall be no less than 100 feet for sewers 42
inches and larger in diameter. Deflection of pipe sections shall not exceed the
maximum deflection recommended by the pipe manufacturer. The deflection shall
be uniform and finished installation shall follow a smooth curve.
   (E)   Manholes.
      (1)   Manholes shall be installed to provide access to continuous
underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and maintenance.
Manholes may be used as inlet or drainage structures and shall be provided at
the following locations:
         (a)   Where one or more storm sewers converge.
         (b)   At the point of beginning or at the end of a curve, and at the
point of reverse curvature (PC, PT, PRC).
         (c)   Where the pipe size changes.
         (d)   Where an abrupt change in alignment occurs.
         (e)   Where a change in grade occurs.
         (f)   At suitable intervals in straight sections of sewer.
      (2)   The maximum distance between storm sewer manholes, unless otherwise
approved by the Council, shall be as follows:
 
Size of Pipe (inches) Maximum Distance (feet)
12 through 42         400
48 and larger         600
 
   (F)   Inlets.
      (1)   (a)   Inlets or drainage structures shall be utilized to collect
surface water through grated openings and convey it to storm sewers, channels
or culverts. Inlet design and spacing shall be in accordance with Section 8-300
of the Illinois Department of Transportation Drainage Manual or other approved
design procedure.
         (b)   The inlet grate opening provided must be adequate to pass the
design 10 year flow with 50% of the sag inlet areas clogged. An overflow
channel from sag inlets to the overflow channel or basin shall be provided at
sag inlets, so that the maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the
street sag shall not exceed 7 inches. Inlets may be used as manholes at
locations where the pipe sizes do not exceed eighteen (18) inches in diameter.
      (2)   Inlet design and spacing may be done using the Rational Method. Use
of the HEC 12 computer program is also an acceptable method. Gutter spread on
continuous grades may be determined using the modified Manning’s equation, or
by using the attached Figure 3, Flow in Triangular Gutter Sections.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-11)
§ 53.12 WORKMANSHIP AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Workmanship. The specifications for the construction of storm sewers
shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the latest edition of the
Illinois Department of Transportation’s “Standard Specifications for Road and
Bridge Construction”.
   (B)   Materials. Storm sewer manholes, inlets, pipe and fittings used in
storm sewer construction shall conform to the materials shown in the latest
edition of the Illinois Department of Transportation’s “Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction”.
   (C)   Special Hydraulic Structures.
      (1)   Special hydraulic structures required to control the flow of water
in storm runoff drainage systems include junction chambers, drop manholes,
inverted siphons, stilling basins, or other special structures.
      (2)   The use of these structures shall be limited to those locations
justified by prudent planning and by careful and thorough hydraulic engineering
analysis.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-12)
§ 53.13 OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other design
requirements contained herein.
   (A)   Manning Equation. The waterway for channels shall be determined using
Manning’s Equation.
Q = AV = A (1.486/n) (R 2/3) (s 1/2), where:
A = waterway area of channel in square feet
Q = discharge in cubic feet per second, cfs
V, R, s and n are explained in § 53.11(A)
   (B)   Channel Cross Section and Grade.
      (1)   The required channel cross section and grade are determined by the
design capacity, the material in which the channel is to be constructed, and
the requirements for maintenance. A minimum depth may be required to provide
adequate outlets for subsurface drains, tributary ditches, or streams. The
channel grade shall be such that the velocity in the channel is high enough to
prevent siltation, but low enough to prevent erosion.
      (2)   Velocities less than 1.5 feet per second should be avoided because
siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel cross section. The
maximum permissible velocities in vegetal lined channel are shown in Table 4.
Developments through which the channel is to be constructed must be considered
in the design of the channel section.
   (C)   Side Slopes. Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper than 2 to
1. Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease of
maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper than
1-1/2 to 1 with adequate provisions made for weep holes. Side slopes steeper
than 1-1/2 to 1 may be used for lined channels providing that the side lining
and structural retaining wall are designed and constructed with provisions for
live and dead load surcharge.
   (D)   Channel stability.
      (1)   Characteristics of a stable channel are:
         (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable limits.
         (b)   The channel banks do not erode to the extent that the channel
cross section is changed appreciably.
         (c)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop.
         (d)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts, bridges or
elsewhere.
         (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of uncontrolled
surface flow to the channel.
      (2)   Channel stability shall be determined for an aged condition and the
velocity shall be based on the design flow or the bank full flow, whichever is
greater, using “n” values for various channel linings as shown in Table 3. In
no case is it necessary to check channel stability for discharges greater than
that from a 100 year return period storm.
      (3)   Channel stability must be checked for conditions immediately after
construction. For this stability analysis, the velocity shall be calculated for
the expected flow from a ten year return period storm on the watershed, or the
bank full flow, whichever is smaller. The “n” value for newly constructed
channels in fine grained soils and sands may be determined in accordance with
the National Engineering Handbook 5, Supplement B, Soil Conservation Service,
and shall not exceed 0.025. The allowable velocity in the newly constructed
channel may be increased by a maximum of 20 percent to reflect the effects of
vegetation to be established under the following conditions:
         (a)   The soil and site in which the channel is to be constructed are
suitable for rapid establishment and support of erosion controlling vegetation.
         (b)   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted to the area,
and proven methods of establishment are shown.
         (c)   The channel design includes detailed plans for establishment of
vegetation on the channel side slopes.
   (E)   Drainage of Waterways. Vegetated waterways that are subject to low
flows of long duration or where wet conditions prevail shall be drained with a
tile system or by other means such as paved gutters. Tile lines may outlet
through a drop structure at the end of the waterway or through a standard tile
outlet.
   (F)   Establishment of New Drain. When the Council determines it is
necessary to establish a new drain, each developer must provide the necessary
information and meet the requirements of this ordinance.
   (G)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   The design of channels will provide all structures required for the
proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto and travelways for
operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and structures needed for entry of
surface and subsurface flow into channels without significant erosion or
degradation shall be included in the design of channel improvements.
      (2)   The design is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water
level control devices, and any other appurtenance affecting the functioning of
the channels and the attainment of the purpose for which they are built.
      (3)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts, bridges,
buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and subsurface
drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall be evaluated
to determine the need for modification or replacement.
      (4)   Culverts and bridges which are modified or added as part of channel
improvement projects shall meet reasonable standards for the type of structure,
and shall have a minimum capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental
agency design requirements, whichever is greater.
   (H)   Disposition of Spoil. Spoil material resulting from clearing, grubbing
and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner which will:
      (1)   Minimize overbank wash.
      (2)   Provide, for the free flow of water between the channel and flood
plain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based on
continuous dikes being installed.
      (3)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance.
      (4)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible, consistent
with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner.
      (5)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the extent
feasible.
      (6)   Be approved by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources,
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, or US Army Corps of Engineers
(whichever is applicable) if deposited in the floodway.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-13)
§ 53.14 CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIALS.
   (A)   Construction. Specifications shall be in keeping with the proceeding
standards and shall describe the requirements for proper installation of the
project to achieve its intended purpose.
   (B)   Materials.
      (1)   Materials acceptable for use as channel lining are:
         (a)   Grass.
         (b)   Revetment riprap.
         (c)   Concrete.
         (d)   Hand laid riprap.
         (e)   Precast cement concrete riprap.
         (f)   Grouted riprap.
         (g)   Gabions.
      (2)   Other lining materials may be used with prior approval of the
Council. Materials shall comply with the latest edition of the Illinois
Department of Transportation’s “Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction”.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-14)
§ 53.15 STORM WATER DETENTION.
   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect to the
detention of storm water runoff.
   (A)   Acceptable Detention Methods. The increased storm water runoff (peak
rate) resulting from a proposed development should be detained on site by the
provisions of appropriate wet or dry bottom reservoirs, by storage on flat
roofs, parking lots, streets, lawns or other acceptable techniques. Measures
which retard the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels
shall also be used to control the runoff rate partially. Detention basins shall
be sized to store excess flows from storms with a ten (10) year and one hundred
(100) year return period. Control devices shall limit the discharge to a rate
no greater than that prescribed by this ordinance (see Sections (F) and (G)).
   (B)   Time of Concentration. All storm water management projects within the
City of Mt. Vernon must be done using the time of concentration methodology
outlined in the SCS TR-55 manual. The TR-55 method examines the factors which
affect time of concentration including surface roughness, channel shape and
flow patterns along with watershed slope. Through the examination of sheet,
shallow, concentrated and open channel flows, a more refined time of
concentration may be determined. The methodology represents the best attempt of
a Federal Agency to standardize times of concentration procedures.
   (C)   Design Storm. Design of storm water detention facilities shall be
based on a return period of once in 10 years and once in 100 years. The storage
volume and outflow rate shall be sufficient to handle storm water runoff from a
critical duration storm, as defined in Sections (F) and (G). Rainfall depth
duration frequency relationships and intensity duration frequency relationships
shall be those given in Tables 5 and 5A.
   (D)   Allowable Release Rate.
      (1)   Design of storm water detention facilities shall be based on the
allowable release rate of storm water originating from a proposed development
and shall not exceed the amount specified in §
53.05 Storm Water Control Policy, and as described in Sections (F) and (G).
      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm sewer system
is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided in Table 5A, then the
allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity
of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and additional
detention as determined by the Council shall be required to store that portion
of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.
      (3)   The area will be considered an impact drainage area subject to the
provisions of §
53.18 of this Ordinance.
      (3)   If more than one detention basin is involved in the development of
the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable release rate from
any one detention basin shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its
drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the
restriction.
   (E)   Drainage System Overflow Design. Drainage systems shall have adequate
capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all upstream tributary areas
through the development under consideration for a storm of 100 year design
return period calculated on the basis of upstream land in its undeveloped
state. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, shall
be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate
have previously been approved by the Council and evidence of its construction
can be shown.
   (F)   Determination of Storage Volume Rational Method.
      (1)   The Rational Method may be used to determine the 10 year return
period undeveloped release rate for sites of less than five (5) acres of
commonly owned contiguous property where no depressional storage exists.
      (2)   Step Procedure.
         (a)   Determine total drainage area in acres “A”.
         (b)   Determine composite runoff coefficient “Cu” based on existing
land use (undeveloped).
         (c)   Determine time of concentration “Tc” in minutes based on
existing conditions.
         (d)   Determine rainfall intensity “Iu” in inches per hour, based on
time of concentration and using Figure 1 or from data given in Table 5A for the
ten (10) year return period.
         (e)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped), and ten
(10) year return period:
Qu = CuIuA
         (f)   Determine composite runoff coefficient “Cd” based on developed
conditions and a one hundred (100) year return period.
         (g)   Determine the one hundred (100) year return period rainfall
intensity “Id” for various storm durations “td” up through the time of
concentration for the developed area using Table 5A.
         (h)   Determine developed inflow rates “Qd” for various storm
durations “td” measured in hours.
Qd = CdIdA
         (i)   Compute a storage rate “Std” for various storm durations “td” up
through the time of concentration of the developed area.
Std = Qd Qu
         (j)   Compute required storage volume “SR” in acre feet for each storm
duration “td”. This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration (2td) hours
with the peak flow of Std and td hours.
SR = Std (td/12)
         (k)   Select the largest storage volume computed in step 10 for
detention basin design.
   (G)   Determination of Storage Volume Hydrograph Methods.
      (1)   Methods other than the rational method for determining runoff and
routing of storm water may be used to determine the storage volume required to
control storm water runoff. The SCS TR-20 computer model with the SCS TR-55
time of concentration and curve number calculation methodologies, and Huff
Third Quartile (50%) rainfall distribution (Table 6) must be used to determine
the 10 year return period pre development release rate for sites of five (5)
acres or more and for sites with existing depressional storage. The SCS TR-20,
and SCS TR-55 models are approved by the Council for appropriate use in
analysis of the runoff and routing of storm water. The use of these models or
other approved procedures can be defined in an eight step procedure to
determine the required storage volume of the detention basin.
      (2)   Step Procedure.
         (a)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be used for
prediction of runoff and routing of storm water.
         (b)   Determine the critical storm duration. The critical duration
storm for computer modeling shall be equal to or greater than the time of
concentration for the watershed being modeled.
         (c)   Determine the ten (10) year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote this
flow by Qu10.
         (d)   Determine the one hundred (100) year runoff hydrograph (Hd100)
for developed conditions.
         (e)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (Hs100) by
subtracting a flow up to Qu10 from the hydrograph (Hd100) found in step (d).
         (f)   Determine the volume of water (Vs) to be stored by calculating
the area under the hydrograph Hs100.
         (g)   The detention basin must be designed to store the largest volume
(Vs) found for any storm duration analyzed in step (f).
         (h)   Approved routing techniques may be used to determine the final
detention storage required.
   (H)   General Detention Basin Design Requirements.
      (1)   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the storm water
runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by this Ordinance.
The volume of such storage provided in these basins, together with such storage
as may be authorized in other on site facilities shall be sufficient to control
excess runoff from the one hundred (100) year storm.
      (2)   The following design principles shall be observed:
         (a)   The maximum volume of water stored and subsequently released at
the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of 48
hours unless additional storms occur within the period.
         (b)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored (without a
permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet.
         (c)   All storm water detention facilities shall be separated by not
less than 25 feet from any building or structure to be occupied.
         (d)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to provide for
aesthetic and recreational features such as sliding hills, sports fields, etc.
Detention pond side slopes no steeper than 6 horizontal to 1 vertical for
safety, erosion control, stability and ease of maintenance shall be permitted.
         (e)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of 4 inches shall be
provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large animals from
crawling into the structures.
         (f)   Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate locations to warn
of deep water, possible flooding conditions during storm periods and other
dangers that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed necessary by the
Council.
         (g)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to operate as simply
as possible and shall require little or no maintenance and/or attention for
proper operation. They shall limit discharges into existing or planned
downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the predetermined maximum
authorized peak flow rate.
         (h)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or spillway shall
be provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in emergency
conditions should the normal discharge devices become totally or partially
inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its operation
is automatic and does not require manual attention.
         (i)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be provided
throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required.
         (j)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary maintenance shall
be performed on a regular basis to assure continued operation in conformance to
design.
         (k)   Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all
design features.
         (l)   No residential lot or any parts thereof shall be used for the
storage of water, either temporary or permanent, without approval of the
Council.
   (I)   Dry Bottom Basin Design Requirements. Detention basins which will not
contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following requirements:
      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated to facilitate complete interior
drainage of dry bottom basins, to include the provisions of natural grades to
outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter drainage
facilities, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.
      (2)   The detention basin shall, whenever possible, be designed to serve
a secondary or multipurpose function. Recreational facilities, aesthetic
qualities (open spaces) or other types of use shall be considered in planning
the detention facility.
   (J)   Wet Bottom Basin Design Requirements. Where a part of a detention
basin will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items required for
detention storage shall apply except that the system of drains without a
positive gravity outlet required to maintain a dry bottom basin will not be
required. A controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain the design
water level in the wet bottom basin and provide required detention storage
above the design water level. However, the following additional conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   (a)   Basins designed with permanent pools or containing permanent
ponds shall have a water area of at least one half acre.
         (b)   If fish are to be maintained in the pond, a minimum depth of
approximately 10 feet shall be maintained over at least 25 percent of the pond
area. The remaining pond area shall have no extensive shallow areas, except as
required by subsection (3) below.
      (2)   In excavated lakes the underwater side slopes in the lake shall be
stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be considered to be
stable.
      (3)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and must be
installed in all ponds approximately 30 to 36 inches below the permanent water
level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18 inches above the
permanent water line shall be provided.
      (4)   A safety ramp exit from the pond is required in all cases and shall
have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope of 6 horizontal to 1 vertical.
The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent its deterioration due to
vehicle use and/or wave action.
      (5)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control weed growth
and larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the easy
removal of sediment which will accumulate during periods of pond operation. A
means of maintaining the designed water level of the pond during prolonged
periods of dry weather is also required.
      (6)   For emergency use, basin cleaning, or shoreline maintenance,
facilities shall be provided or plan prepared for auxiliary equipment to permit
emptying and drainage.
      (7)   Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided,
if required. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these
aeration facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements
for the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be
prepared to the satisfaction of the Council.
      (8)   The perimeter of wet bottom detention basins, defined by the high
water contour which represents the high water elevation, shall be a minimum
horizontal distance of 10 feet from high voltage electric lines.
   (K)   Roof Top Storage. Detention storage requirements may be met in total
or in part by detention on flat roofs. Details of such designs are to be
included in the building permit application and shall include the depth and
volume of storage, details of outlet devices and downdrains, and elevations of
emergency overflow provisions.
   (L)   Parking Lot Storage. Paved parking lots may be designed to provide
detention storage of storm waters on all or a portion of their surfaces. Depths
of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of six (6) inches so as to
prevent damage to parked vehicles and so that access to parked vehicles is not
impaired. Locate the deepest ponding zones at remote and least used portions of
the parking lot.
   (M)   Facility Financial Responsibilities. The construction cost of storm
water detention systems and facilities as required by this ordinance shall be
part of the cost of land development.
   (N)   Facility Maintenance Responsibility.
      (1)   Maintenance of detention/retention facilities during construction
and thereafter shall be the responsibility of the land developer/owner.
Assignment of responsibility for maintaining facilities serving more than one
lot or holding shall be documented by appropriate covenants to property deeds,
unless responsibility is formally accepted by a public body. This determination
shall be made before the final drainage plans are approved.
      (2)   Storm water detention and retention basins may be donated to the
City of Mt. Vernon or other unit of government approved by the City, for
ownership and permanent maintenance providing:
         (a)   The City or other governmental unit is willing to accept
responsibility and the City Council accepts operation and maintenance in
writing by appropriate resolution.
         (b)   The facility has been designed and constructed according to all
applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
         (c)   All improvements have been constructed, approved and accepted by
the City for the land area served by the basin.
         (d)   Retention ponds containing a permanent pool of water have all
slopes between the permanent pool and high water line sodded and the remaining
land area hydroseeded using a method approved by the Council; are equipped with
electrically driven aeration devices, if required to maintain proper aerobic
conditions and sustain aquatic life; provide suitable access acceptable to the
responsible government agency; and have the high water line not closer than 25
feet to any property line.
         (e)   Dry detention ponds shall have all slopes, bottom of the basin
and areas above the high water line hydroseeded; and shall have the high water
line not closer than 25 feet to any development boundary.
   (O)   Inspections. All public and privately owned detention storage
facilities shall be subject to inspection by representatives of the City.
   (P)   Corrective Measures. If deficiencies are found upon inspection, the
owner of the detention/retention facility shall be required to take the
necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails to do so,
the City may undertake the work and the owner shall be personally liable for
all costs incurred by the City and the real estate shall be subject to a lien
for said costs, which lien may be foreclosed by the City with all the costs and
expenses therefore, including reasonable attorney’s fees being assessed against
the owner and the real estate.
   (Q)   Joint Development of Control Systems. Storm water control systems may
be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as long as
compliance with this Ordinance is maintained. Developers are encouraged to plan
and construct these systems on a joint or regional basis.
   (R)   Installation of Control Systems. Runoff and erosion control systems
shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site development.
Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional 6 (six) percent
of available capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from
development and to permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between
cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect sediment and debris in specific
locations so that removal cost are kept to a minimum. The Council will require
temporary and permanent erosion control plans to be submitted as a part of the
construction plans.
   (S)   Detention Facilities in Flood Plains. If detention storage is provided
within a flood plain, only the net increase in storage volume above that which
naturally existed on the flood plain shall be credited to the development. No
credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the regulatory flood
at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.
   (T)   Off Site Drainage Provision. When the allowable runoff is released in
an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be required to
construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert increased flood
hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one point instead of
the natural overland distribution. The requirement of off site drains shall be
at the discretion of the Council.
   (U)   Erosion Control. Erosion control plans shall be submitted as part of
the construction plans and specifications and shall include the following:
      (1)   A complete copy of the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Control Plan
filed with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
      (2)   Temporary erosion control measures necessary during the initial
construction and establishment phases up to final site grading and seeding.
      (3)   A permanent erosion control plan of all the graded and non-hard
surface areas within the proposed development, as planned for completion, up to
and including seeding of the final lot on which business or residential
dwellings are to be placed.
      (4)   Details concerning removal of temporary erosion control devices
after the initial establishment of adequate vegetative cover.
      (5)   Maintenance procedures, as part of the continuing plan, to keep all
of the land under adequate cover and erosion at an acceptable minimum.
(Prior Code, Art. 20, § 20-15)
§ 53.16 CERTIFICATIONS REQUIRED.
   (A)   After completion of the project and before final approval and
acceptance can be made, an “As Built” set of plans prepared and certified by a
professional engineer shall be submitted to the Council for review. These plans
shall include all pertinent data relevant to the completed storm drainage
system and shall include:
      (1)   Pipe size and pipe material.
      (2)   Invert elevations.

§ 71.01 TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (A)   The City Manager shall place and maintain traffic-control signs,
signals, and devices when and as required under the traffic regulation of this
City to make effective the provisions of said regulations, and may place and
maintain such additional traffic-control devices as he may deem necessary to
regulate traffic under the traffic regulations of this City or under State Law,
or to guide or warn traffic. All traffic-control signs, signals, and devices
shall conform with the manual and specifications approved by the State Highway
Department or resolution adopted by the City Council of this City.
   (B)   All signs and signals required hereunder for a particular purpose
shall, so far as practicable, be uniform as to type and location throughout the
City. All traffic-control devices so erected and not inconsistent with the
provisions of State Law or this Article, shall be official traffic-control
devices. The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic-control device applicable thereto, placed in accordance with the
traffic articles of this City, unless otherwise directed by a police officer,
subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle
in this Article.
   (C)   No provision of this Article for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective, even
though no signs are erected in place.
   (D)   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
the words, “Go” “Caution”, or “Stop”, or exhibiting different colored lights
successively, one at a time, or with arrows, the colors only shall be used and
said terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and
pedestrians as follows:
      (1)   Green alone or “Go”.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited, may
proceed straight through to turn right or left, unless a sign at such place
prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning
right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to
pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the
time such signal is exhibited.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
      (2)   Yellow alone or “Caution”, when shown following the green or “go”
signal.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
respective “green” or “go” movement is being terminated and is thereby warned
that the “red” or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter; and
such vehicular traffic shall not enter the intersection when the “red” or
“stop” signal is exhibited.
         (b)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until
the “green” or “go” is shown alone (unless authorized to do so by a pedestrian
“walk” signal).
      (3)   Red alone or “Stop”.
         (a)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering
the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or “go” is
shown alone.
         (b)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway until
the green or “go” is shown alone (unless authorized to do so by a pedestrian
“walk” signal).
   (E)   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words,
“walk” or “wait” are in place, such signals shall indicate the following:
      (1)   Walk - Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the
roadway in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by
the drivers of the vehicles.
      (2)   Wait - No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the
direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his
crossing on the walk signal, shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety zone while
the wait signal is showing.
   (F)   Whenever flashing red or yellow signals are used, they shall require
obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
      (1)   Flashing Red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   Flashing Yellow (caution sign). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   (G)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon, or in view of, any
highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be
or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic-control device or
railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of the
traffic, or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any
official traffic-control device or any railroad sign or signal, and no person
shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any highway
any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising. This
shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private property adjacent to
highways or signs giving useful directional information and of a type that
cannot be mistaken for official signs. Every prohibited sign, signal, or
marking is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the authority having
jurisdiction over the highway is hereby empowered to remove same or cause it to
be removed without notice.
   (H)   No person shall, without lawful authority, attempt to, or in fact,
alter, deface, injure, knock down, or remove any official traffic-control
device or any railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield, or insignia
thereon, or any other part thereof.
   (I)   The City Traffic Engineer is hereby authorized:
      (1)   To designate and maintain, by appropriate devices, marks or lines
upon the surface of the roadway, crosswalks at intersections where, in his
opinion, there is particular danger to pedestrians crossing the roadway, and at
such other places as he may deem necessary.
      (2)   Establish safety zones of such kind and character and at such
places as he may deem necessary for the protection of pedestrians.
      (3)   To mark lanes for traffic on street pavements at such places as he
may deem advisable, consistent with the traffic articles of this City.

   (B)   The driver of a vehicle within an intersection intending to turn to
the left shall yield the right-of- way to any vehicle approaching from the
opposite direction which is within the intersection or so close thereto as to
constitute an immediate hazard, but said driver, having so yielded and having
given a signal, when is as required by this Article, may make such left turn
and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection from said
opposite direction shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle making the left
turn.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for the operator of any vehicle to turn such
vehicle so as to proceed in the opposite direction unless such movement can be

four or more lines of moving traffic, when such movement can be made in safety.
         (b)   No person shall drive off the pavement or upon the shoulder of
the roadway in overtaking or passing on the right. The driver of a vehicle may
overtake and pass another vehicle on the right on a one-way street or upon any
roadway on which traffic is restricted to one direction of movement, where the
street or roadway is free from obstructions and of sufficient width for two or
more lanes of moving traffic.
      (4)   No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the
roadway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same

traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing
to be completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any
vehicle approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken. In
every event, the overtaking vehicle must return to the right hand side of the
roadway before coming within 100 feet of any vehicle approaching from the
opposite direction.

and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection from said
opposite direction, shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle making the left
turn.
      (9)   A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within
a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has first
ascertained such movement can be made with safety.

         (a)   The signals herein required shall be given either by means of
the hand or arm or by a signal lamp or signal device, but when a vehicle is so
constructed or loaded that a hand or arm signal would not be visible, both to
the front and rear of such vehicle, then said signals must be given by such
lamp or device. All signals herein required to be given by the hand and arm
shall be given from the left side of the vehicle in the following manner and
such signals shall indicate as follows:

any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway or which is
approaching so closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time often the driver is moving across or within the intersection,
but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a safe interval
occurs.

bailee of such abandoned vehicle.
      (2)   When an abandoned vehicle comes into the temporary possession or
custody of a person in this State, not the owner of the vehicle, such person
shall immediately notify the Police Department when the vehicle is within the
corporate limits of the City.
      (3)   A vehicle shall be presumed to be an “abandoned vehicle” for the
purposes of this Section when:
         (a)   The vehicle or any part thereof is parked or left unattended on
private property without authorization of the owner of the property or on
public property other than a highway in view of the general public for a period
of seven days or more; or
         (b)   The vehicle or any part thereof is parked or left unattended on
a highway or street within the City 10 hours or more.
            1.   An abandoned vehicle may be authorized to be removed or towed
by the members of the police department, provided however, that prior to the
removal of an abandoned vehicle, written notice personally served or written
notice by certified mail return receipt requested shall be given to the
registered owner. Said notice shall identify the vehicle, identify the location
of the vehicle, state the factual basis for towing and presumption of
abandonment, and advise that, unless the vehicle is removed by the owner within
72 hours, it will be removed by the police department as an abandoned vehicle.
Said notice shall also state that the owner may appear before the Building
Official for the City of Mt. Vernon within the 72 hours and show cause why the
vehicle should not be removed as an abandoned vehicle. In addition, a notice
shall be placed upon the vehicle identifying the vehicle as an abandoned
vehicle and stating that the vehicle will be removed by the Police Department
after a lapse of 72 hours from the date appearing on the notice unless the
vehicle is removed by the owner or unless the owner contacts the Building
Official for the City of Mt. Vernon and shows cause why it should not be
removed.
            2.   When removal of a vehicle from either public or private
property is authorized by order of the Police Department pursuant to subsection
(M), the owner of the vehicle shall be responsible for all towing costs
( including storage) and the administrative fee imposed by (N) herein.
         (c)   1.   When a vehicle is authorized to be removed, the Police
Department shall keep and maintain a record of the vehicle removed, listing the
color, year of manufacture, manufacturer’s trade name, manufacturer’s series
name, body style, vehicle identification number, license plate year and number,
and registration sticker year and number displayed on the vehicle. The records
shall also include the date and hour of removal, location removed from,
location removed to, reason for removal, and the name of the officer
authorizing the removal.
            2.   When the Police Department does not know the identity of the
registered owner or other legally entitled person, they will cause the State
Motor Vehicle Registration records to be searched by a directed communication
to the Secretary of State for the purpose of obtaining the required ownership
information.
            3.   The Police Department will cause the stolen motor vehicle
files of the State Police to be searched by a directed communication to the
State Police for stolen or wanted information on the vehicle. When the State
Police files are searched with negative results, the information contained in
the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files will be searched by the
State Police. The information determined from these record searches will be
used by the Police Department in sending a notice by certified mail to the
owner or legally entitled person, advising that the vehicle has been removed by
the Police Department, advising where the vehicle has been removed to, advising
as to the legal or factual basis for the determination that the vehicle was
abandoned, requesting a disposition be made, and setting forth public sale
information.
            4.   When the registered owner or other person legally entitled to
the possession of the vehicle cannot be identified from the registration files
of the State or from the registration files of a foreign state, if applicable,
the Police Department shall notify the State Police for the purpose of
identifying the vehicle’s owner or other person legally entitled to possession
of the vehicle.
            5.   The information obtained by the State Police will be
immediately forwarded to the law enforcement agency having custody of the
vehicle for notification of the owner.
            6.   At any time before a vehicle is sold at public sale or
disposed of as provided herein, the owner or other person legally entitled to
its possession may reclaim the vehicle by presenting to the Police Department
proof of ownership or proof of the right of possession of the vehicle. No
vehicle shall be released to the owner or other person under this Section until
all towing and storing charges have been paid; provided, however, that the
owner or such person may appear before the Building Official for the City of
Mt. Vernon and show cause why he should not be required to pay the towing and
storage charges.
            7.   Whenever an abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed motor
vehicle seven years of age or newer remains unclaimed by the registered owner
or other person legally entitled to its possession for a period of thirty (30)
days after notice has been given as provided herein, the Police Department
having possession of the vehicle shall cause it to be sold at public sale to
the highest bidder. Notice of the time and place of the sale shall be posted in
a conspicuous place for at least ten (10) days prior to the sale, the Police
Department shall cause a notice of the time and place of the sale to be sent by
certified mail to the registered owner or other person known by the Police
Department or towing service to be legally entitled to the possession of the
vehicle. Such notice shall contain a complete description of the vehicle to be
sold and what steps must be taken by any legally entitled person to reclaim the
vehicle.
            8.   In those instances where the certified notification given
after removal of the vehicle has been returned by the postal authorities to the
Police Department due to the addressee having moved or being unknown at the
address obtained from the registration records of the State, the sending of the
certified notice pertaining to the sale of the vehicle will not be required.
            9.   When the identity of the registered owner or other person
legally entitled to the possession of an abandoned, lost, or unclaimed vehicle
of seven years of age or newer cannot be determined by any means provided for
in this Ordinance, the vehicle may be sold as provided herein or disposed of in
the manner authorized by the Ordinance without notice to the registered owner
or other person legally entitled to the possession of the vehicle.
            10.   When an abandoned vehicle of more than seven years of age is
impounded as specified by this Ordinance, it will be kept in custody for a
minimum of 10 days for the purpose of determining ownership, the contacting of
the registered owner by mail, by public service or in person for a
determination of disposition; and an examination of the State Police stolen
motor vehicle files for theft and wanted information.   At the expiration of
the 10-day period without the benefit of disposition information being received
from the registered owner, the Chief of Police will authorize the disposition
of the vehicle as junk, except that if in the opinion of the Police Officer
processing the vehicle it has a value of $200 or more and can be restored to
safe operating condition, the Police Chief or his designee may authorize its
purchase as salvage, provided the requirements of State law are met.
            11.   A vehicle classified as an antique vehicle may, however, be
sold to a person desiring to restore it.
            12.   When a motor vehicle in the custody of the Police Department
is reclaimed by the registered owner or other legally entitled person or when
the vehicle is sold at public sale or otherwise disposed of as provided by this
Ordinance, a report of the transaction will be retained by the Police
Department for a period of one year from the date of the sale or disposal.
            13.   When a vehicle located within the corporate limits of the
City is authorized to be removed by the Chief of Police and disposed of as set
forth in this Ordinance, the proceeds of the public sale or disposition after
the deduction of towing, storage, and processing charges shall be deposited in
the municipal treasury.
            14.   Any Police Officer, towing service owner, operator, or
employee shall not be held to answer or be liable for damages in any action
brought by the registered owner, former registered owner, or his legal
representative, or any other person legally entitled to the possession of a
motor vehicle when the vehicle was processed and sold or disposed of as
provided by this Ordinance.
   (N)   Except as otherwise provided within the (K) when any vehicle is
removed or towed pursuant to the authorization of the Mt. Vernon Police
Department, an administrative fee of $100.00 shall be imposed and collected
prior to release of the motor vehicle to its owner or other authorized person;
collection of said administrative fee shall be effected pursuant to the towing
policy and procedures of the Mt. Vernon Police Department.

      (4)   Testing. There shall be no testing or demonstrating alarm systems
without first notifying the City of Mt. Vernon, in accordance with procedures
established by the city, prior to such test or demonstration, and obtaining
permission of the respective Fire Chief or Police Chief or such person
delegated by each. Any activation due to a test of demonstration without said
notice and permission shall be deemed a false alarm. The respective Fire Chief
or Police Chief shall be notified in writing by the alarm installer of the
expected completion date of the initial installation, major alteration, or
addition of an alarm system prior to completion of said work. All fire alarms
shall be tested at least once a month on either the first or third Monday
between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.; or if the first or third Monday falls on a
holiday, then testing shall occur on the first Monday following the holiday.
      (5)   Maintenance. Each person, firm, or corporation holding a permit for
the operation and maintenance of an alarm system shall be responsible to
maintain, repair, and keep in good working order the alarm system; and each
shall be responsible for any false alarms transmitted by the device which they
operate or maintain. The failure to maintain, repair, or keep in good working
order the alarm system as required herein shall, subject to the hereinafter
provisions for notice and opportunity to be heard, be cause to suspend or
revoke any permit issued hereunder and shall be cause for removal of the alarm
system. The City of Mt. Vernon shall maintain a record of all false alarms and,
subject to the hereinafter provisions for notice and opportunity to be heard,
may revoke or suspend any permit for the operation of the alarm system involved
in the transmission of two (2) false fire alarms or four (4) false police
alarms in any one calendar year.
      (6)   Charges.
         (a)   In addition to any other penalty herein provided, the City of
Mt. Vernon shall charge a fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per false fire
alarm to the owner or occupant of the premises for each automatic alarm
transmitted to the City of Mt. Vernon by activation on the premises of an
automatic or manual alarm system, in excess of two (2) fire alarms in each
calendar year from the said premises, and a fee of Twenty five Dollars ($25.00)
for each false police alarm in excess of four (4) in any calendar year.
         (b)   Charges shall be payable to the City of Mt. Vernon by the user
permit holder upon receipt of a statement for such charges. Activation of an
alarm by an act of God or by an independent cause not within the control or
responsibility of the alarm user shall not constitute a false alarm for
purposes of imposition of the charges herein.
      (7)   No charge shall be imposed for false alarms for sixty (60) days
after initial installation of thirty (30) days after major alterations or
additions, nor shall false alarms during that period be counted toward the
false alarms allowed per calendar year provided written proof satisfactory to
the City of such major alterations is submitted to the respective Fire Chief or
Police Chief by the permit holder within five (5) days after receiving a
billing of charges for the false alarm, provided only one such waiver of
charges shall be permitted each calendar year.
      (8)   Hearings. Every alarm user shall upon written request be entitled
to a hearing before the City Manager and Police Chief and Fire Chief, or
designated agents of each of said officers, upon receipt of a billing of
charges for false alarms or upon receipt of notice of suspension or revocation
of any permit. Said hearing must be requested by the alarm user within five (5)
days after receiving a billing of charges for the false alarm or after
receiving notice of suspension or revocation of the permit. At the hearing, the
alarm user will be given the opportunity to present evidence and argument to
show that the permit should not be suspended or revoked, or that the alarm
activation was not false, or that the alarm activation comes within one of the
permissible exceptions or that the permit should not be suspended or revoked.
      (9)   Liability. The City of Mt. Vernon shall take reasonable precaution
to assure that alarm signals received by the City of Mt. Vernon are given
appropriate attention and are acted upon with dispatch. However, the City of
Mt. Vernon and the alarm contractor shall not be liable for any failure or
neglect of any person in connection with the installation and operation of
equipment, the transmission of alarm signals, and the relaying of such signals.
In the event that the City of Mt. Vernon finds it necessary to disconnect a
defective signaling device, the City of Mt. Vernon shall incur no liability by
such action.
      (10)   Automatic Dialer-type Alarms. The procedures and requirements for
automatic dialer-type alarms shall be the same as for direct connection alarms,
except as herein provided. The City of Mt. Vernon shall provide a distinct and
separate trunk line(s) apart from emergency telephone trunk lines for the use
of automatic dialer-type alarms, and only those lines may be used to
automatically transmit a signal to Central Dispatch. Under no circumstances
shall the automatic dialer-type equipment be permitted to automatically connect
to the emergency telephone lines. Automatic dialer-type fire alarms shall be
subject to the provisions of §
91.10(B)(2).
      (11)   Local Alarm System. The procedures and requirements for local
alarm systems shall be the same as for direct connection alarms, except as
hereinafter provided. Every local alarm system installed subsequent to the
effective date of this Section shall be constructed, equipped, and installed in
such fashion as to be incapable of sounding for more than thirty (30) minutes
after a signal activation thereof. A fine of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00)
shall be assessed to the owner or occupant of the premises whose local alarm
system activates to sound for a period in excess of thirty (30) minutes after
the City’s Central Dispatch is notified of said alarm. All single station smoke
detectors that are installed in a home, place of business, or other premises
shall be exempt from this Section.
      (12)   Resetting the Alarm. The alarm user shall be solely responsible
for resetting the alarm system after activation. If the alarm system is in good
working order, the resetting of the alarm system shall occur as soon as the
condition giving rise to the alarm, activation permits; or, in the case of a
false alarm, the resetting of the alarm system shall occur immediately.
      (13)   Penalties. Except as otherwise provided, whoever violates any
provision of this Section shall be subject to a fine of not less than Five
Dollars ($5.00) or more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) for each offense.

   (A)   The following list constitutes the official tree species for Mt.
Vernon, Illinois. No species other than those included in this list may be
planted as Street or Park Trees without written permission of the City Tree
Board. Only desirable trees of good appearance, beauty, and adaptability that
are generally free from injurious insects, diseases, or other limitations may
be planted. The overall objective of proper tree selection is to select the
right tree for the right location in order to benefit from trees without being
subject to future maintenance liability or hazards.

   (B)   Small Trees are appropriate in street locations where due to space
limitations larger trees cannot be properly utilized without creating space
conflicts with existing trees. Height limitations imposed by overhead utilities
also necessitate the use of appropriate Small Trees in order to avoid line
conflicts and the necessity of excessive utility trimming that results in
disfigured trees. On the whole, Small Trees tend to be more ornamental than
their larger counterparts and can create an added aesthetic dimension to the
streetscape.

§ 92.03 UNSUITABLE TREES.
   (A)   (1)   The following is a listing of the trees more or less common to
our area not suitable as Street or Park Trees. Their lack of suitability is
based on the undesirable growth habits, fruiting habits, form, susceptibility
to serious diseases, propensity to storm damage, and a host of other
limitations too numerous to mention.
      (2)   The limitations listed for each tree or species group are not all
inclusive, and list only the more serious problems encountered locally.
   (B)   Any tree listed as unsuitable presently growing within City parks as a
result of previous unrestricted and natural plantings constitutes a maintenance
expense to the City; and, therefore, upon removal, shall be replaced with the
appropriate, approved Small, Medium, or Large Tree.

contact information. The Department will develop and maintain a policy to

willing public or private entities to determine whether a true personal
necessity exists in a particular circumstance. The Department shall provide
specific support, guidance and contacts for officers. But it shall be construed
as direct evidence that no true personal necessity exists if the individual who
is camping refuses to take advantage of proffered alternatives to their present
camping practices (which could include, in the most extreme cases, short term
use of another location more easily monitored by the Department).
   (C)   Upon a determination by law enforcement that an area constitutes an
unauthorized encampment, regardless of whether an individual is cited for a
violation of this ordinance, City officials shall have the right to remove any
debris, contraband, or personal property that creates a legitimate health and
safety concern, or that creates an immediate and substantial danger to the
environment. No warning is required prior to such confiscation relating to
health and safety concerns.
   (D)   Materials confiscated pursuant to this ordinance that are unsanitary
or a danger to the health and safety of any person may be immediately disposed
of. Otherwise, the Department shall provide 24-hour written notice prior to
confiscating property. The Department shall retain personal property
confiscated pursuant to this ordinance in a manner consistent with the handling
of other confiscated property and must not dispose of such personal property
for a period of at least 30 calendar days, during which time the owner may
retrieve such property from the Department, pursuant to the procedure outlined
in the policy. Nothing prevents Department members from disposing of property
with the consent of the property owner. When Department members have received
consent to dispose of property, City officials shall assist Department members
when necessary.

§ 110.04 TRANSIENT MERCHANTS/ITINERANT VENDOR.
   (A)   Definitions.
      ITINERANT VENDOR. Any person within the City who transports (by vehicle,
on foot, or similar means) tangible personal property for retail sale or who
solicits retail orders or sales for future delivery of tangible personal
property or who solicits (from a vehicle, on foot, or similar means) orders or
commitments for sale of services, whether for future delivery or not, and who
does not maintain in the City an established office, distribution house, sales
house, warehouse, service center, or lawful fixed location from which such
business is conducted. However, this Ordinance does not apply to any person who
delivers tangible personal property within the City who is fulfilling an order
for such property which was solicited or placed by mail, the internet, or other
similar means. Moreover, the term ITINERANT VENDOR shall not include a person
who makes sales of tangible personal property within the City during each week
during the calendar year or a person who makes sales of tangible personal
property within the City not less than five days of each week during a
consecutive 120-day period.
      PERSON. An individual, corporation, partnership, trust, firm,
association, or other entity; except that PERSON shall not include a person

a bona fide similar purpose.
      TRANSIENT MERCHANT. Any person who is engaged temporarily in the retail
sale of tangible personal property or in the solicitation of retail orders or
sales for future delivery of tangible personal property or in the solicitation
of orders or commitments for sale of services, whether for future delivery or
not, within the City and who, for the purpose of conducting such business,
occupies any building, room, structure of any kind or vacant lot. It shall be
prima facie evidence that a person is a transient merchant under this Ordinance
if the person does not transact business from a fixed location or if the person
does not own or lease for a term of at least six months the property from which
business is conducted. However, this Ordinance does not apply to any person
selling products, goods or merchandise, which are raised, produced, or
manufactured by him upon property owned by him or upon property on which he
resides, although said sales must comply with all applicable laws, including
zoning regulations. This Ordinance also does not apply to a person conducting a
sale of used property owned by him, commonly known as a garage, yard, rummage
or moving sale, upon property owned by him or upon property on which he
resides, if the duration of the sale is not more than three consecutive days
and if no such sale is held more than two separate occasions in any calendar
year, although said sale must comply with all applicable laws, including zoning
regulations; conducting a sale on more than two separate occasions in any
calendar year shall constitute a commercial or business activity. The term
TRANSIENT MERCHANT shall not include persons who are leasing floor space within
a commercially zoned building or other retail space at a mall or shopping
center for a period of more than 30 days but less than 120 days.
   (B)   It is a violation of this Ordinance for any person, either as
principal or agent, to conduct business as a transient merchant or itinerant
vendor within the City without each person, or if sales are made by an agent,
without each agent, first having obtained a license under this Ordinance and
without complying with the Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act (35 ILCS 120/) as may
be required, including obtaining a Certificate of Registration and collecting
tax. The license obtained from the City under this Ordinance shall be
prominently displayed and visible at all times when selling or when soliciting
orders for tangible personal property and shall be presented to each customer
or solicitee, prior to any solicitation, for review when soliciting orders or
commitments for sale of services. Each license shall be returned to the office
of the City Clerk upon expiration of the license or upon the transient merchant
or itinerant vendor ceasing sales or solicitations, whichever occurs first.
Each license issued herein shall state in prominent and visible language the
following: The holder of this License is not affiliated with nor endorsed by
the City of Mt. Vernon, Illinois.
   (C)   (1)   Any person who wishes to obtain a license as a transient
merchant or itinerant vendor shall file a written license application with the
City Clerk. The license application shall be under oath or certified under
penalties of perjury, and shall include the applicant’s name, telephone number,
email address, permanent business address (which must include a street
address), residence address of the principal (and if the applicant is a
corporation, the residence addresses of its officers), the location(s) at which
the applicant intends to do business, the nature of the business the applicant
intends to conduct, a copy of the applicant’s Certificate of Registration under
the Retailers’ Occupation Tax Act, a copy of the applicant’s driver’s license
or other photo identification or photo, a complete inventory of the goods the
applicant intends to offer for sale, a complete list and description of the
service or services the applicant intends to offer for sale, a list of all
licenses to conduct business as a transient merchant or an itinerant vendor
obtained by the applicant in the City of Mt. Vernon in the 12 months preceding
the date of filing of the application, and copies of any license issued by the
State of Illinois held by the applicant related to the goods or services
subject of the application. In addition, the applicant shall provide a copy of
a written lease or other written evidence from the owner of the location where
the applicant proposes to sell indicating permission of the owner to use the
location. An applicant for an Itinerant Vendor license shall also provide
certificates of insurance or other satisfactory proof of motor vehicle and
liability insurance as required within Section (F)(20) herein.
      (2)   Prior to issuance of the license, each applicant shall file with
the City Clerk a cash deposit in the amount of One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00), unless waived by the City Clerk in accordance with this Ordinance.
The City Clerk shall waive the cash deposit requirement unless, within the 12-
month period preceding the application, there has been filed with the City
Clerk either a certified copy of a Court Judgment against the applicant or
three written complaints from consumers or other persons describing a loss or
damage as the result of the purchase of merchandise or services from the
applicant or as the result of the negligent or intentionally tortious act of
the applicant or as the result of conducting business or making sales or
providing services within the City as transient merchant or itinerant vendor
without a license. The City Clerk shall hold the cash deposit for two years for
the benefit of any person who suffers loss or damage as the result of the
purchase of merchandise from said person licensed under this Ordinance or as
the result of the negligent or intentionally tortious act of the person
licensed under this Ordinance. The City Clerk shall pay any portion of the cash
deposit to any person in accordance with a Judgment or other Order of the
Jefferson County, Illinois Circuit Court without making an independent finding
as to the amount of the cash deposit that is payable to that person; any
balance of the cash deposit held by the City Clerk two years after the
expiration of a license of a person under this Ordinance shall be refunded by
certified mail to the person; provided, however, that if the person shall fail
to keep the City Clerk informed of a current mailing address that said bond
shall be forfeited to the City after one attempt by the City Clerk to refund
the bond by certified mail.
      (3)   Except as hereinafter provided, each transient merchant or
itinerant vendor shall pay a licensing fee at the rate of $25.00 per day or
$200.00 for a 30 day period, payable prior to issuing of the license, which
license shall state the specific dates (month, day, and year) that the license
is valid; provided that for any transient merchant or itinerant vendor for
which the City Clerk initially, or the City Manager upon appeal, reasonably
determines has been identified to be operating within the City without a
current valid license during any part of a 12 month period prior to date of
application, the application fee shall be double the stated amount.
   (D)   If any person makes retail sales or makes solicitations as a transient
merchant or itinerant vendor without having obtained a license under this
ordinance, the Mt. Vernon Police Department, as the direction of the City
Manager, may hold the inventory, vehicle, or other personal property of the
person until he obtains a license to conduct business as a transient merchant
or itinerant vendor. If the property has been held by the City of Mt. Vernon
for more than 60 days and the person whose property is being held has not
obtained a license under this Ordinance, the City may petition the Circuit
Court of Jefferson County, Illinois for an Order for the sale of the property
being held. If the Court finds that the person whose property is held has not
obtained a license under this Ordinance, the Court may order and authorize the
City to sell the property. The proceeds of the sale of the property less
reimbursement to the City of the reasonable expenses for the storage and sale
of the property and less any fine imposed for violation of this Ordinance shall
be deposited in the General Corporate Fund of the City.
   (E)   (1)   No itinerant vendor entering onto any premises in the City upon
which a residence is located shall use or attempt to use any entrance other

first look for the Notice provided for in this Ordinance and examine the
Notice, if any is attached, and said itinerant vendor shall be governed by the

vendor shall immediately and peacefully depart from the premises. In addition,
any itinerant vendor who has gained entry to any residence, whether invited or
not, shall immediately and peacefully depart from the premises when requested
to do so by the occupant. Failure to comply with a Notice or other request
shall constitute a trespass and also a violation of this Ordinance.

and related to the ineligibility of the applicant or of the premises for a

arising from the inaction or inability of the City in making or obtaining a

(Prior Code, Art. 11, § 11.15.16)
§ 117.17 LICENSING PROCEDURE AND LICENSING DECISIONS.
   (A)   Subject to §
117.09(D), if the City Clerk of the City of Mt. Vernon or his designee
determines that facts exist for denial of a new license or denial of a renewal
or suspension of a license or revocation of a license under this
Chapter 117, the City Clerk or his designee shall notify the applicant or
licensee (respondent) in writing of the denial or of the intent to suspend or
revoke the license, including the grounds therefor, by personal delivery or by
U.S. certified mail. The notification shall include a statement of the
respondent’s rights of appeal under this subsection. The notification shall be
personally served or mailed by certified mail to the mailing address on file
with the City Clerk for the respondent. Within ten business days of receipt of
such notice, the respondent may provide to the City Clerk or his designee a
written response that shall include a statement of reasons why the respondent
believes the license should not be denied, suspended or revoked. If no response
is received by the City Clerk then a final notice of denial, suspension, or
revocation shall be served upon respondent by personal service or certified
mail. If a response is received, within five business days of the receipt of
the response, the City Clerk or Hearing Officer shall notify respondent in
writing of a hearing date on the respondent’s denial, suspension or revocation
proceeding. Within ten business days of the receipt of respondent’s written
response the Hearing Officer shall conduct a hearing at which hearing the
respondent shall have the opportunity to present all of respondent’s arguments
and to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and witnesses on his own
behalf and to cross-examine witnesses; witnesses shall be sworn and the
proceeding recorded. The City Clerk shall also be represented by counsel and
shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the grounds
for denying, suspending, or revoking the license. The Hearing Officer shall
issue and serve upon respondent by personal service or by U.S. certified mail a
written opinion within five business days after conclusion of the hearing. If
applicable, respondent shall receive a final notice of denial or suspension or
revocation which shall be included in the Hearing Officer’s Order; said final
notice shall include a statement advising the respondent of the right to appeal
under this subsection. If the Hearing Officer finds that no grounds exist for
denial of the license then the City Clerk or his designee shall issue the
license to the applicant, or if the City Clerk fails to issue said license
within two business days, the Hearing Officer shall issue the license. BUSINESS
DAY means any day that City Hall is open to the public for the transaction of
business.
   (B)   When a decision to deny, suspend or revoke a license becomes final,
the applicant or licensee whose application for a license has been denied or
whose license has been suspended or revoked shall have the right to seek
judicial review and to appeal or challenge such action to any court of
competent jurisdiction and proper venue. If a court action challenging the
Hearing Officer’s decision is initiated, the City shall timely and without
delay prepare and transmit to the court a transcript of the hearing.
   (C)   (1)   An applicant for a new sexually oriented business license, as
opposed to a renewal, may but is not required to participate in the appeal
(hearing) process set forth within paragraph (A) above. An applicant whose
application for a new license has been denied by the City Clerk and who
disagrees with the decision may at the applicant’s sole election:
         (a)   participate in the appeal process as set forth within paragraph
(C)(1) above or
         (b)   give written notice to the City Clerk after notice of denial of
the license, of the applicant’s “Intent to Open” the sexually oriented business
without a license on the tenth calendar day after the date of the Written
Notice of Intent to Open is filed in the Office of the City Clerk; upon filing,
said Notice shall be marked by the City Clerk with the date and time of filing.
      (2)   (a)   If the applicant elects to give Written Notice of Intent to
Open as provided above, then the City of Mt. Vernon must within the 10-day
period designated within the Notice of Intent to Open petition the Illinois
Second Judicial Circuit Court or any Court of competent jurisdiction and proper
venue and obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief. The Court in
which the petition for injunctive relief or other judicial relief is filed
shall determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for issuance of a
sexually oriented business license under §
117.10 and determine the validity of any provision thereof that the applicant
does not meet and shall in accordance with Article XI, Part I of the Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure, being 735 ILCS 5/11-101, or other applicable statute
grant such relief as the Court deems necessary and appropriate. If the City
fails to petition for injunctive relief or if the Court fails to issue the
injunctive relief or grant such other relief as requested denying the license
or enjoining the sexually oriented business from opening prior to expiration of
the 10-day period described within the Notice of Intent to Open, the license
shall be deemed to be issued, although the licensee and the licensed premises
must still comply with all provisions of this
Chapter 117 the same as if the license had been issued by the City Clerk, as a
failure or inability of the City to obtain injunctive relief or other judicial
relief does not excuse compliance by the licensee with any provision of this
Chapter 117, except the license requirement or such requirement as determined
by a Court not to be applicable or enforceable. The license and licensee shall,
except as provided within §
117.16(C) also be subject to all provisions of this
Chapter 117 relating to renewal of a license, suspension of a license, or
revocation of a license. If the City does not petition for injunctive relief or
other judicial relief within the 10-day period described within the Notice of
Intent to Open and if the license is deemed to be issued, the City may
nonetheless petition the Court for injunctive relief or other judicial relief
or initiate proceedings under this §
117.17 to suspend or revoke the license; provided, however, that a “license
deemed to be issued” shall be entitled to the same stay of proceedings to
preserve the status quo as provided for a license actually issued by the City
Clerk. In addition, if an applicant elects to seek an appeal to the City
Hearing Officer of a decision of the City Clerk denying a license, the
applicant shall still retain and be entitled to exercise its rights under this
subparagraph and give the “Written Notice of Intent to Open” after the Hearing
Officer issues a final notice of denial.
         (b)   1.   An applicant for a new sexually oriented business employee
license, as opposed to a renewal, may but is not required to participate in the
appeal (hearing) process set forth within paragraph (C)(1) above. An applicant
whose application for a new employee license has been denied by the City Clerk
and who disagrees with the decision may at the applicant’s sole election:
               a.   participate in the appeal process as set forth within
paragraph (C)(1) above or
               b.   give written notice to the City Clerk after notice of
denial of the license, of the applicant’s “Intent to Be Employed” by the
sexually oriented business without a license upon expiration of twenty-four
hours from the date and time the Written Notice of Intent to Be Employed is
filed in the Office of the City Clerk; upon filing, said Notice shall be marked
by the City Clerk with the date and time of filing.
            2.   If the applicant elects to give Written Notice of Intent to Be
Employed as provided above, then the City of Mt. Vernon must within the 24 hour
period designated within the Notice of Intent to Be Employed petition the
Illinois Second Judicial Circuit Court or any court of competent jurisdiction
and proper venue and obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief. The
Court in which the petition for injunctive relief or other judicial relief is
filed shall determine whether the applicant meets the requirements for issuance
of a sexually oriented business employee license under §
117.11 and determine the validity of any provision thereof that the applicant
does not meet and shall in accordance with Article XI, Part I of the Illinois
Code of Civil Procedure or other applicable statute grant such relief as the
court deems necessary and appropriate. If the City fails to petition for
injunctive relief or if the Court fails to issue the injunctive relief or grant
such other relief as requested denying the license or enjoining the applicant
from being employed prior to expiration of the 24-hour period described within
the Notice of Intent to Be Employed, the license shall be deemed to be issued,
although the licensee must still comply with all provisions of this
Chapter 117 the same as if the license had been issued by the City Clerk, as a
failure or inability of the City to obtain injunctive relief or other judicial
relief does not excuse compliance by the licensee with any provision of this
Chapter 117, except the license requirement. The license and licensee shall,
except as provided within §
117.16(C), also be subject to all provisions of this
Chapter 117 relating to renewal of a license, suspension of a license, or
revocation of a license. If the City does not petition the Court for injunctive
relief or other judicial relief within the period described within the Notice
of Intent to Be Employed and if the license is deemed to be issued, the City
may nonetheless petition for injunctive relief or other judicial relief or
initiate proceedings under §
117.17 to suspend or revoke the license; provided, however, that a “license
deemed to be issued” shall be entitled to the same stay of proceedings to
preserve the status quo as provided for a license actually issued by the City
Clerk. In addition, if an applicant elects to seek an appeal to the City
Hearing Officer of a decision of the City Clerk denying a license, the
applicant shall still retain and be entitled to exercise its rights under this
subparagraph and give the “Written Notice of Intent to Be Employed” after the
Hearing Officer issues a final notice of denial.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection, in the event the
licensee appeals the denial of a renewal application or the suspension of a
license or revocation of a license, the status quo immediately prior to such
denial, suspension or revocation shall be maintained throughout the pendency of
the appeal including the hearing process within subparagraph (A) above up to
and including judicial review as provided within subparagraph (B) above. Upon a
judicial decision being entered, the stay to preserve the status quo provided
herein shall cease and the order or decision of the court shall determine
whether an additional stay is appropriate, required or permitted by law.

other person under §

compliance with any provision of this Article or of any building, electrical,
fire, housing, plumbing, or other health and safety provision of the Revised
Code of Ordinances or of any Code adopted thereby, or whenever the Building
Official, any Building Code Inspector, or other designated Inspector has
reasonable cause to believe there exists in or upon any building, structure, or
premises a condition or violation which makes such building, structure,
premises, or any part thereof (which are also collectively referred to herein
as “premises”) a nuisance, unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous, the Building
Official or Inspector shall have the right, as hereinafter defined, to enter
any such building, structure, premises, or any part thereof at all reasonable
times to inspect the same and to perform any duty imposed upon said Building
Official or Inspector. However, except as hereinafter stated or as otherwise
permitted by law, if such building, structure, or premises is occupied by a
person with apparent authority to allow entry, the Official or Inspector shall
first identify himself and request entry, and upon request present proper
credentials; or if such building, structure, or premises is not occupied by a
person with apparent authority to allow entry, the Official or Inspector shall
first make a reasonable effort to locate an owner, occupant, or other such
person having apparent authority to allow entry of such building, structure, or
premises and shall request entry. If entry is refused or if no owner, occupant,
or such other person with apparent authority can be found, the Building
Official or Inspector shall have recourse to every remedy as provided by law to
secure entry. A PERSON WITH APPARENT AUTHORITY means a person who reasonably
appears to be 18 years or older and who reasonably appears to be either the

   (B)   In the event any person shall fail to give consent or shall interfere
with the right of entry of any Building Official or Inspector, the City may
apply for an Administrative Inspection Warrant. An application for an
Administrative Inspection Warrant shall be based upon a reasonable belief by an
Inspector that an inspection is required to enforce a health, safety, or public
welfare Ordinance, Code, or Regulation:
      (1)   said inspection may be justified as to a specific building,
structure, or premises on the belief that there is located within or upon the
particular building, structure, or premises to be inspected one or more
violations of statutes, ordinances, codes, or regulations that the Inspector is
authorized to enforce, or
      (2)   said inspection may be justified as part of a general inspection
program authorized by the Revised Code of Ordinances, such as fire, building,
or housing inspections to enforce or to determine compliance.
   (C)   An application for an Administrative Inspection Warrant shall identify
the office and authority of the Inspector designated to make the inspection,
shall identify the premises to be inspected, shall set forth the purpose and
justification of the inspection, and shall state that the owner or other person
with apparent authority to allow entry of the place to be searched has refused

inspection or enforcement. An application for an Administrative Inspection
Warrant shall be under oath. The application for Administrative Inspection
Warrant shall be submitted to a Judge of the Second Judicial Circuit, but need
not be filed with the Clerk of said Court until a warrant has been executed or
has been returned “non-executed.” Notice of the submission of an Application
for Administrative Inspection Warrant is not required to be given to any
person. The Judge shall issue the Warrant if the requirements of this Section
have been met, including specifically that the justification as required by law
has been found. An Administrative Inspection Warrant shall constitute authority
to inspect, which authority to inspect shall include the authority to use any
reasonable force necessary to enter upon the premises and shall include the
authority to photograph the premises subject of the Warrant. The Inspector
shall also have the authority to remove any item that presents an immediate and
obvious threat to health or safety if such removal (i.e. abatement action) is
otherwise permitted by law.

shall state the date and time of issuance, the justification and purpose of the
inspection, the date or dates on which the inspection may occur, the
identification of the premises to be inspected, and shall bear the signature of
the Judge of the Second Judicial Circuit issuing the warrant. Upon presentation
of an Administrative Inspection Warrant to any owner or occupant or other
person with apparent authority of a structure or premises authorized to be
inspected pursuant to said Administrative Inspection Warrant, said owner or
occupant or other person with apparent authority shall permit immediate entry
into said structure or onto said premises. In the event no owner or occupant or
other person with apparent authority is present upon the premises to be
inspected at the time of execution of the Warrant, the Inspector may enter upon
the premises, and no person shall interfere with the inspection, and the
premises may be inspected and a copy of the Warrant shall be left upon the
premises in a conspicuous place and thereafter a copy of the Warrant shall,
within a reasonable time as determined by the circumstances, be served
personally or be served by regular mail to the last known address of the owner
or other person with apparent authority and to the known adult occupants of the
premises, unless same shall be excused by the Court.
   (E)   A police officer may be requested to assist in the execution of the
Administrative Inspection Warrant; such police officer shall assist the
Inspector authorized to execute the Warrant, which assistance may include using
any reasonable force necessary to enter upon the premises or enter within any
building or structure or necessary to protect the Inspector from harm or threat
of harm.
   (F)   Not later than ten days after execution of an Inspection Warrant, the
Inspector or his designee shall file a Return with the Clerk of the Court
setting forth the date and time of the inspection and the Inspector or his
designee shall (unless excused by the Court) serve the Return upon the owner or
other person with apparent authority and upon the known adult occupants of the
premises subject of the inspection by personal service or by regular mail to
the last known address. If any item is seized or removed from any premises, the
Return shall identify the item seized or removed, shall state the reason for
the removal and shall include a photograph of the item seized or removed.
   (G)   No Administrative Inspection Warrant shall be required to enter upon

is invited into.
      (2)   Areas where the owner, occupant, or possessor has no reasonable
expectation of privacy within the area and as to the items to be inspected.
      (3)   Areas of a business subject to extensive regulation (e.g. alcohol,
weapons) where the inspection will impose only a minimal threat to justifiable
expectations of privacy and the inspection is a necessary part of a regulatory
scheme designed to further an urgent governmental interest.
      (4)   Areas for which an emergency situation reasonably appears present
requiring immediate entry to determine, prevent, or address an immediate threat
to health or safety.
      (5)   Areas that are not occupied and that are open (unsecured and
accessible) requiring entry to determine if any immediately hazardous condition
exists.
      (6)   Areas for which consent to inspect has been given by a person who
appears to have apparent authority to consent.
   (H)   Inspections without a Warrant shall be limited as to time, place, and
scope as determined by the justification for the inspection without a Warrant.

§ 152.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS OF FACT.
   It is hereby found and declared there exists in the City, premises used,
designed, or intended for human habitation which are, or may become in the near
future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance, and
further that such conditions together with inadequate provisions for light and
air, insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper heating,
unsanitary conditions and overcrowding constitute a menace to the health,
safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of its citizens. It is further
found and declared that the existence of such conditions, factors, or
characteristics has created and will continue to create, slum and blighted
areas requiring large scale clearance, and further that in the absence of
corrective measures, such areas will experience a deterioration of social
values, a curtailment of investment and tax revenues, and an impairment of
economic values. It is further found and declared that the establishment and
maintenance of minimum housing standards are essential to the prevention of
blight and decay and the safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and
welfare.

a unit, or as contiguous units on the last preceding transfer of ownership
thereof, into two or more parcels, sites, or lots, any one of which is less
than five acres in area, for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of
transfer of ownership, provided, however, that the division or partition of
land into parcels of more than five acres not involving any new streets or
easements of access, and the sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining lot
owners, where such sale or exchange does not create additional building sites,
shall not be considered a Subdivision; or the improvement of one or more
parcels of land for residential, commercial or industrial structures or groups
of structures involving the Subdivision and Allocation of land as Streets or
other open spaces for common use by the owners, occupants, or lease holders or
as easements for the extension and maintenance of public sewer, water, storm
drainage, or other public utilities and facilities; provided, however, that
where no new streets or roads are involved, divisions of land for agricultural
purposes where the resulting parcels are more than three acres or larger in
size, divisions of property by testamentary or intestate provisions, or
divisions of property upon court order shall not be considered SUBDIVISIONS.
   THOROUGHFARE PLAN. The part of the Comprehensive Plan, now or hereafter
adopted which includes a major street and highway plan and sets forth in
location alignment, dimensions, identification, and classification of existing
and proposed streets, highways and other thoroughfares.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 161.001 STATEMENT LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the intent of this ordinance to divide the City and the land lying
contiguous to and within one and one half miles beyond the corporate limits,
into zones, or districts, for the purpose of restricting and regulating therein
the location, erection, constriction, reconstruction, alteration and use of
buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, and other
specified uses; to regulate the intensity of the use of lot areas, and to
regulate and determine the area of open spaces surrounding such buildings; to
establish building lines and the location of buildings designed for specified
industrial business, residential and other uses within such areas; to fix
standards to which buildings or structures shall conform therein; to prohibit
uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the character of such
districts, respectively; to prevent additions to and alterations or remodeling
of existing buildings or structures in such a way as to avoid the restrictions
and limitations lawfully imposed hereunder; to limit congestion in the public
streets by providing for off-street parking and loading and unloading of
vehicles; providing for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses of land,
building and structures; to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety
from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and air; to
prevent the over crowding of land; to conserve the taxable value of land and
buildings throughout the City; and to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-101)
§ 161.002 SHORT TITLE.
   This amended ordinance, including the zoning District Maps made a part
hereof shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the “Zoning Ordinance
of the City of Mount Vernon, Illinois”.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-102)
§ 161.003 TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF ORDINANCE.
   The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to that land located within the
corporate limits of the City of Mt. Vernon, Illinois, and the land lying
contiguous to and within one and one half miles beyond the corporate limits as
they may exist from time to time.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-103)
§ 161.004 ESTABLISHMENTS OF DISTRICTS: PROVISION FOR OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Official Zoning Map.
      (1)   The territorial limits described in §
161.003 are hereby divided into districts, as shown on the official zoning map
which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be part of this ordinance.
      (2)   The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the
Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City of Mt.
Vernon under the following words: “This is to certify that this is the Official
Zoning Map referred to in §
161.004 of the Revised Code of Ordinances of the City of Mt. Vernon, Illinois.
(the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mt. Vernon, Illinois)”, together with the
date of the adoption of this ordinance. The official zoning map indicating
current zoning district boundaries shall be located in the office of the City
Clerk.
      (3)   If, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and the
Illinois Municipal Code, changes are made in district boundaries or other
matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such chances shall be entered on
the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the
City Council, with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: “By official
action of the City Council the following (change) changes were made in the
Official Zoning Map:
(Date, Ordinance Number                  , Brief description of Change),” which
entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the City Clerk.
      (4)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Official Zoning Map
or matter shown thereon, except in conformity with the procedures set forth in
this ordinance. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or
persons shall be considered a violation of this ordinance and punishable as
provided under Chapter 10 of the Revised Code of Ordinances.
   (B)   Annual Updating of Copies of the Official Zoning Map. In the event
there have been changes in the Official Zoning Map in any calendar year, the
Administrative Official hereinafter provided for shall prepare and publish or
print copies of the Official Zoning Map reflecting zoning district boundaries
as of December 31. Such copies shall be printed prior to March 31 of the
succeeding year, and shall bear the following words. “This is a copy of the
Official Zoning Map reflecting zoning district boundaries as of December 31,
20      “. Fees for such copies of Official Zoning Map shall be established in
accordance with §
161.165 of this Ordinance. Regardless of the existence of copies of the
Official Zoning Map, the Official Zoning Map located in the Office of the City
Clerk shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and
water areas, buildings, and other structures in the territorial limits.
   (C)   Replacement of Official Zoning Map.
      (1)   In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged,
destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of
changes and additions, the City Council may by resolution adopt a new Official
Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new
Official Zoning Map may correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the
prior Official Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of
amending the original Official Zoning Map or any subsequent amendment thereof.
The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor,
attested by the City Clerk, and bearing the seal of the City of Mt. Vernon
under the following words: “This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map
supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted (date of adoption of
map being replaced) as part of Ordinance No.           of the City of Mt.
Vernon, Illinois”.
      (2)   Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost or has been
totally destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining
shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its
adoption or amendment.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-104)

(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-123)
NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND,
NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES, NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES
AND PREMISES, NON-CONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE AND
NON-CONFORMING SIGNS
§ 161.025 INTENT.
   (A)   (1)   Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments
that may later be adopted there exist: lots, structures, uses of land and
structures, characteristics of use, and signs which were lawful before this
ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments.
      (2)   It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these non-conformities
to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is
further the intent of this ordinance that non-conformities shall not be
enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
   (B)   Non-conforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible
with permitted uses in the districts involved. A non-conforming use of
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after
passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional
signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other
uses, or a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved.
   (C)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building
construction has been carried on diligently.
   (D)   Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where excavating or demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that
work shall be carried on diligently.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-108.1)
§ 161.026 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   (A)   In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a
single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of amendment of this
ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the
Board of Appeals.
   (B)   In any district, if two or more lots or combination of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, and if all or part of the
lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this
ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner
which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by
this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with width or area below requirements stated in this ordinance.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-108.2)
§ 161.027 NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND (OR LAND WITH MINOR STRUCTURES ONLY).
   Where at the time of passage of this ordinance lawful use of land exists
which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance, and
where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost
exceeding $1,000 the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful for a period of five years from the date of adoption of this ordinance,
provided:
   (A)   No such non-conforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
   (B)   No such non-conforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance.
   (C)   If any such non-conforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land
is located.
   (D)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
ordinance shall be erected in connection with such non-conforming use of land.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-108.3)
§ 161.028 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this
ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions.
   (A)   No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its non-conformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its non-conformity.
   (B)   Should such non-conforming structure or non-conforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its
physical structure, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance.
   (C)   Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved.
(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-108.4)
§ 161.029 NON-CONFORMING USE OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND PREMISES IN
COMBINATION.
   If lawful use involving individual structures, or of structure and premises
in combination, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of
this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful; subject to the following provisions:
   (A)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance
in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located.
   (B)   Any non-conforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a
structure or structures and premises, may as a conditional use be changed to
another non-conforming use provided the Planning Commission shall find that the
proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than
the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the Planning

pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, FRONT YARDS shall be provided on
all frontages. Where one of the FRONT YARDS that would normally be required on
a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the
administrative official may waive the requirement for the normal FRONT YARD and
substitute therefore a special yard requirement which shall not exceed the
average of the yards provided on adjacent lots.
      (3)   In the case of corner lots, a front yard of the required depth
shall be provided on the frontage facing the street with the greatest traffic
volume as determined by the administrative official, and where possible in

required generally in the district;
         (b)   No other FRONT YARD on such lot shall have less than half the
full depth required generally.
      (5)   Depth of required front yards shall be measured at right angles to
a straight line joining the foremost points of the side lot lines. The foremost
point of the side lot line, in the case of rounded property corners at street
intersections, shall be assumed to be the point at which the side and front lot
lines would have met without such rounding. (See illustrations at §
161.211 of this Section.)
   YARD, SIDE.
      (1)   A yard extending from the rear line of the required front yard to
the rear lot line, or in the absence of any clearly defined rear lot line to
the point on the lot farthest from the intersection of the lot line involved
with the public street. In the case of THROUGH LOTS, side yards shall extend
from the rear lines of front yards required. In the case of CORNER LOTS, yards
remaining after full and half depth front yards have been established shall be
considered SIDE YARDS.
      (2)   Width of a required SIDE YARD shall be measured in such a manner
that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width required by district
regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side lot line. (See
illustrations at §
161.211 of this Section.)
   YARD, REAR.
      (1)   A yard extending across the rear of the lot between inner side yard
lines. In the case of through lots and corner lots, there will be no REAR
YARDS, but only front and side yards.
      (2)   Depth of a required rear yard shall be measured in such a manner
that the yard established is a strip of the minimum width required by district
regulations with its inner edge parallel with the rear lot line. (See
illustrations at §
161.211 of this Section.)
   YARD, SPECIAL.
      (1)   A yard behind any required yard adjacent to a public street,
required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard, but adjacent to
a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term “side yard” nor the term
“rear yard” clearly applies.
      (2)   In such cases, the administrative official shall require a yard
with minimum dimensions as generally required for a side yard or a rear yard in
the district, determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of
the lot on which the yard is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with
due regard to the orientation and location of structures and buildable areas
thereon. (See illustration at §
161.211 of this Section.)

§ 161.245 SIGN FACE AREA.
   (A)   Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets
is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet
   (B)   Double sided signs. Only one (1) side of a double sided sign is
counted in determining the area of sign faces. Where the two (2) sides are not
of equal size, the larger of the two (2) sides is used for the determination of
sign area. The area of multiple-faced signs in which the interior angle formed
by the faces is greater than ninety-one degrees (91°) shall be expressed as the
sum of the areas of all the faces, except for multiple-faced signs containing
faces that are configured back to back, in which case the area of the faces
configured back to back will be calculated according to the rule for double-
faced signs.
   (C)   Round, Oval & Irregularly shaped signs. To be measured based on the
appropriate mathematical formula to obtain the sign area for a circle, an oval
or irregularly shaped sign.
   (D)   Calculating Sign Area.
      (1)   Signs containing integral background areas: The area of a sign
containing a clearly defined background area shall be calculated based on the
area of the smallest standard geometric shape or combination of geometric
shapes capable of encompassing the perimeter of the background area of the
sign. In the case of signs in which multiple background areas are separated by
open space, sign area shall be calculated based on the sum of the areas of all
separate background areas, calculated as referenced above, but without regard
for any open space between the separate background areas.
      (2)   Signs without integral background areas: In instances in which a
sign consists of individual elements such as letters, symbols, or other graphic
objects or representations that are painted, attached to, or otherwise affixed
to a surface such as a wall, window, canopy, awning, architectural projection,
or to any surface not specifically designed to serve as a sign background, the
sign area shall be based on the sum of the individual areas of the smallest
geometric shape or combination of geometric shapes capable of encompassing the
perimeters of the individual elements comprising the sign.
   (E)   Awnings and marquees.
      (1)   When graphics or sign copy is incorporated into an awning, the sign
area is determined by computing the area of a standard imaginary geometric
shape or combination of shapes drawn around the sign copy area or graphics.
      (2)   When the ends of awnings or marquees are parallel and contain
graphics or sign copy, only one side is counted in addition to the sign face
area on the front.

highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure.
   (B)   Exception. Where a freestanding sign or sign structure is mounted
along a roadway that has a higher grade level as compared to the grade level
directly below the freestanding sign or sign structure, then the freestanding
sign or structure’s height will be measured from the roadway grade level to the
highest point of the freestanding sign or sign structure. See Figure A.

ZONING DISTRICTS.
   Signs in Agricultural, Flood Plain, Business, and Industrial Zoning
Districts hereinafter collectively called “Non-Residential Zoning Districts”
shall conform to the regulations of this Section.
   (A)   Temporary signs are permitted only as provided within §
161.251(J) “Temporary Signs”.
   (B)   Permanent Signs in Non-Residential Zoning Districts are permitted and
regulated by reference to types noted below.
      (1)   Freestanding Signs:
         (a)   Freestanding signs include Pylon, Pole with Cladding, Multi
Panel Pylon, Pole, Monument, Canopy and Monolith (See §
161.243).
         (b)   1.   Freestanding signs, regardless of type or combination of
types, shall be limited to one (1) per site held in single and separate
ownership, plus for a site that has frontage on more than one (1) street, one
(1) such sign shall be permitted for each additional separate street frontage;
and if a site has individual street frontage that exceeds three hundred (300)
lineal feet on said street, one (1) such sign on such frontage shall be
permitted for each multiple of three hundred (300) lineal feet of frontage for
each separate street frontage. Freestanding signs are reduced if a site has
Projecting Signs; see (B)(6) below.
            2.   Unless otherwise regulated by specific reference herein, the
area and height above grade of any freestanding sign shall not exceed the
amounts specified in Table 2 below. A site of ten (10) acres or more, situated
within one and one-half (1.5) miles of the intersection center-point of the I-
64/I-57 Interstate Exchange and having more than nine hundred (900) continuous
lineal feet of street frontage may, in lieu of placing multiple free standing
signs within said nine hundred (900) lineal feet, place a single free standing
sign having an area at twice the applicable size specified in Table 2; provided
that only one such oversized sign shall be permitted for the site. A site that
has street frontage on more than one street may, in lieu of placing a free
standing sign on each street frontage, place a single free standing sign having
an area at one and one-half the applicable size specified in Table 2 on one
street frontage; provided that no free standing sign shall be placed upon the
other street frontage or frontages and not more than one such oversized sign
shall be permitted for the site.

      (2)   Building Signs:
         (a)   Building signs include wall or fascia signs, roof signs, canopy
signs, awning signs, and projecting signs. Building signs for a site,
regardless of type, or combination of types, are collectively limited in total
area to the percentage as stated within Table 3. A building sign type is also
subject to restrictions forth particular sign type as herein provided;
particular restrictions shall supersede general regulations.
         (b)   The total area of all building signs applied to any given façade
with frontage on a street shall not exceed the area computed as a percentage of
the building façade in elevation view, including window and door areas and
cornices to which they are affixed or applied in accordance with Table 3.
Building signs shall be allowed on all sides of the structure provided that
façades that do not have frontage on a street shall only be permitted 10
percent of the building façade in elevation view.
         (c)   In the case of a shopping center or a group of stores or other
multi-use or multi-tenant uses on a lot held in single and separate ownership,
provisions relating to the total area of building signs permitted on a premises
shall apply with respect to the façade of and for each building, separate
store, separate storefront, or separate use. Only wall signs shall be permitted
for individual establishments within a Shopping Center or for each building,
separate store, separate storefront, or separate use.

      (3)   Roof Signs, Special Considerations:
         (a)   Roof signs are permitted by Conditional Use in Non-Residential
Zoning Districts and are in lieu of other building signs. For permitted roof
sign area, see Table 3 above for building signs. The height of any roof sign
above the highest architectural point of the building to which it is mounted
shall not exceed the percentage of the vertical dimension of the building
façade parallel to the sign in accord with sections (B)(3)(a)1. and (B)(3)(a)2.
below. Measurements shall be computed from the highest building point to the
top of the sign.
            1.   Business Zoning District - Twenty-five (25) percent.
            2.   Agricultural or Flood Plain Zoning District - Twenty-five (25)
percent.
            3.   Industrial Zoning District - Forty (40) percent.
         (b)   The area calculation for any roof sign whose orientation on a
roof may be other than parallel to an individual building façade shall be
computed with reference to the building façade that most closely parallels the
orientation of such sign.
      (4)   Canopy Signs (Also Marquee Signs and Signs on Architectural
Projections): Special Considerations.
         (a)   Canopy Signs, Marquee Signs and Signs on Architectural
Projections are signs that are mounted to either structures that project off
the face of the building more than eighteen (18) inches or signs that are
mounted to a freestanding structure not attached to a building that creates a
canopy or covering over an area below.
         (b)   Signs affixed or applied in an essentially flat plane to the
face of a building or freestanding canopy, marquee, or architectural projection
provided that the copy area of any such sign, as defined herein, does not
exceed an area equal to forty (40) percent of the product of the height and
length of the face area of the canopy, marquee, or architectural projection to
which such sign is affixed or applied, or fifteen (15) percent of the building
façade to which it is attached, whichever is greater.
      (5)   Awning Signs: Graphics affixed or applied to the face or side
surfaces of an awning or backlit awning are permitted provided that the copy
area of any such sign copy or graphic, as defined herein, does not exceed an
area in accordance with Table 3 for building signs, to which the awning is
attached.
      (6)   Projecting Signs (Prohibited except in Business Zoning Districts).
         (a)   Projecting signs are permitted only within Business Zoning
Districts and only in lieu of any permitted freestanding signs on any given
property frontage; in the case in which a premises is permitted either
freestanding or projecting signs on any one frontage, projecting signs may be
substituted for any of the permitted freestanding signs on such frontage,
provided that the requirements herein specifically relating to size, height,
and extension of projecting signs are met.
         (b)   Projecting signs shall be limited to one (1) per building façade
on which any such sign is mounted except for a use that fronts on more than one
(1) street, in which case, one (1) such sign shall be permitted per façade for
each separate street frontage. In the case of a building in which any
individual façade exceeds two hundred (200) lineal feet, one (1) such sign
shall be permitted for each two hundred (200) lineal feet of such façade or
multiple thereof on each separate street on which such façade fronts.
         (c)   The area of any projecting sign shall not exceed one (1) square
foot per every two (2) lineal feet of the building façade on which such sign is
mounted, except that no such sign shall be larger in area than one hundred
(100) square feet.
         (d)   No projecting sign shall extend in a vertical dimension above
the highest architectural point of the façade to which it is mounted in excess
of twenty-five (25) percent of the vertical dimension of the façade itself.
         (e)   Projecting signs extending over a public sidewalk shall be
limited to a projection distance not to exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the width of
the sidewalk.

(Prior Code, Art. 21, § 21-126.11)
§ 161.251 ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Total Square Footage. Unless specifically exempted within express
language of the Sign Regulations, the square footage of any sign placed or
erected upon a property shall be included in the total square footage of
signage allowed upon a property. Any sign requiring a Sign Permit which is not
specifically permitted by the Sign Regulations is prohibited, unless granted by
a Conditional Use as provided within §§
161.270 through
161.275.
   (B)   Sign placement and Setback.
      (1)   No sign not forming part of or attached to a structure, except a
directional sign, shall be placed closer than one-half of the minimum yard
requirement required for structures within the applicable Zoning District,
except that within the B-2 Zoning District the minimum setback from a right-of-
way or adjoining property shall be ten (10) feet and within the B-3 Zoning
District, the minimum setback from the right-of-way or adjoining property shall
be ten (10) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing setback requirements, the City
Manager may grant a variance in a setback requirement if the required setback
requirement cannot be met under circumstances where a building or other
permanent structure, lawfully placed and meeting setback requirements at time
of construction, no longer has available space to comply with setback
requirements because of the creation, extension, or widening of public right-
of-way or similarly occurring condition after the date of placement of the
building or structure; in that event, upon a written request, the City Manager
may grant by issuance of a written Permit (which Permit shall be filed with the
City Clerk), a reduction in setback up to two-thirds (2/3) of the distance
between the building or structure and the then existing right-of-way; no other
variances shall be granted. In no event shall any sign obstruct the clear view
of vehicular traffic of any street or access or the clear view of any sign
regulating vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   All signs and sign structures must be erected and attached totally
on or within the site or property to which they refer, and no sign shall be
placed upon any property without the written consent of the owner(s) of the
property.
      (3)   No sign, including any part of the support and foundation, shall be
placed within the right-of-way of any street, alley, or public way, nor upon
any public property without the written approval of the City Council, except as
specifically permitted within paragraph (C) below.
      (4)   In addition to the other requirements stated within the Sign
Regulations, placement of a sign shall be subject to review and approval or
disapproval by the City Manager or designee of the City Manager based upon
compliance with the following clearance requirement:
         (a)   Vision clearance areas: Vision clearance areas are triangular-
shaped areas located at the intersection of any combination of rights-of-way,
alleys or driveways. The sides of the triangle extend thirty (30) feet from the
intersection of the right-of-way, alley or driveway in either/each direction.
No sign shall be installed within this clear sight triangle, notwithstanding
any other provision of the Sign Regulations.
         (b)   Vehicle area clearances: In areas outside of rights-of-way, when
a sign or awning extends over an area in which vehicles travel or are parked,
the bottom of the structure must be at least fourteen (14) feet above the
ground. Vehicle areas include driveways, alleys, parking areas, and loading and
maneuvering areas.
         (c)   Pedestrian area clearances. When a sign or awning extends more
than twelve (12) inches over a sidewalk, walkway, or other space used by
pedestrians, the bottom of the structure must be at least eight (8) feet above
the ground.
         (d)   Clearances from fire escapes means of egress or standpipes.
Signs, sign structures and awnings are prohibited from being erected in any
manner that interferes in any way with the free use of any fire escape, means
of egress or standpipe. Attaching signs, sign structures or awnings to a fire
escape is prohibited.
         (e)   Obstruction of windows and ventilation. Signs, sign structures
and awnings are prohibited from being installed in any way that obstructs any
building openings to such an extent that light, ventilation or exhaust are
reduced to a level below that required by either the Building Code, Plumbing
Regulations, Heating and Ventilating Regulations or Housing and Maintenance
Regulations or other applicable State or local Code.
   (C)   Signs extending into the right-of-way. The following signs are
permitted to extend into the right-of-way:
      (1)   Projecting signs over a public sidewalk are permitted only within
the B-1 Zoning District.
      (2)   Awnings and marquees projecting over a public sidewalk are
permitted only within the B-1 Zoning District.
      (3)   One (1) A-frame sign is permitted for each site only within the B-
1 Zoning District (to be counted within the sign area of permitted freestanding
signs) if it meets the following standards:
         (a)   The sign is entirely outside the surface street or roadway used
or available for use for vehicular traffic;
         (b)   The sign is no larger than ten (10) square feet;
         (c)   The sign does not obstruct a continuous through pedestrian wheel
chair access zone of at least six (6) feet in width.
         (d)   The sign does not obstruct pedestrian or wheelchair access from
the sidewalk to any of the following:
            1.   transit stop areas;

a property; in no event shall a tract leased for the purpose of placing an Off-
Premise or On-Premise Sign be considered a separate property and the property
shall be the entire premises, zoning lot, or real estate tract of which the

property with a Freestanding On-Premise Sign, the number of Freestanding On-
Premise Signs permitted for said property shall be reduced by the number of
Off-Premise Signs upon said property.
      (2)   An Off-Premise Sign situated adjacent to a street shall only face
the direction of the traffic flow for said street.
      (3)   Off premise signs on the same street or combination of streets
facing the same traffic flow, including at street intersection locations, shall
not be placed closer together than 300 feet along said street, or a combination
of streets (Figure 6 deleted); also, except as expressly provided within
paragraph (C)(5) below, Off-Premise Signs positioned across a street from each

right angles to and, therefore, facing traffic on street A may be situated
closer than 300 feet to a similarly positioned sign across the street at right
angles to and, therefore, facing traffic on street B. (See Figure 8 for an
example illustration at 150 feet); each said Sign shall meet all other
requirements of this Section. Except in such limited case, each Off-Premise
Sign positioned across the street from each other shall not be closer than 300
feet and also the 300 feet restriction within (C)(3) above shall apply to each
sign.

SCHEDULE OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 161.310 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The headings in the following Schedule of District Regulations are
self-explanatory. However, prior to any reference to the Schedule, refer to the
following General Statement of Intent which is to be used as a guide in any
interpretation of the various Statements of Intent and Regulations for Land Use
Districts established by this Ordinance.
   (B)   GENERAL STATEMENT OF INTENT.
      (1)   The zoning districts hereby established are to effect a plan of
land use which will:
         (a)   Create order out of chaos.
         (b)   Be based upon existing land use.
         (c)   Provide a pleasant and economical living environment for
inhabitants of the Community through the establishment of a variety of
districts to meet individual preferences and overall community needs.
         (d)   Utilize governmental and public utilities facilities in the most
economical manner possible which in turn should provide the most service for
the least cost.
         (e)   Preserve and enhance property values throughout the community by
keeping like and compatible uses together, and to separate incompatible uses
from each other by designation on the ZONING DISTRICT MAP which is an integral
part of this Ordinance.
      (2)   Land values are highest in the Central Business District Area
(CBD), and diminish as the distance from the CBO increases. Therefore, it is
the purpose and intent of this Ordinance to conserve, protect, enhance, and
utilize to the fullest extent possible these land values which the community
has created. Consequently, in establishing these districts, the general
objectives are to:
         (a)   utilize the existing CBD as the starting point and allowing
within the CBD only appropriate uses,
         (b)   land adjacent to the CBD should permit high density (more people
per acre) residential uses, and
         (c)   land further out to be utilized for lower density residential
purposes.
      (3)   Existing ownership of land is generally in relatively small lot
sizes and which often will be non-conforming to this ordinance. To implement
the general intent of this ordinance, it is hoped that consolidation of these
smaller parcels will be achieved either through private acquisition or some
type of privately owned but unified control, and that planned developments will
be the rule rather than the exception, especially in non-residential areas.
      (4)   (a)   Portions of the existing thoroughfare network are the logical
place for certain types of commercial uses, but should only be permitted in
certain compact spots not only for their own welfare, but for the welfare of
the entire community and its inhabitants. Land for industrial purposes should
be provided, but location should be determined by
            1.   existing industrial uses,
            2.   relationships to the other land use districts, and
            3.   supporting transportation facilities in the thoroughfare
system of the community.
         (b)   The intent for the remaining variety of land uses are stated in
the individual statement of intent for each district. Perpetuation of non-
conformities to the various Land Use Districts will be discouraged in the
administration and interpretation of this ordinance.
      (5)   It is further intended that in the territorial limits outside the
City limits the General Agriculture district be utilized as far as is practical
until residential, commercial or industrial development is proposed as the case
may be. It is also intended that any development proposed in the territorial
limits outside the City limits be considered in conjunction with annexation
agreements.
   (C)   THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
      (1)   The City of Mt. Vernon officially adopted a Comprehensive Plan on
February 17, 1964. It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that the
Comprehensive Plan and its subsequent officially adopted amendments be the
guide for any development in the jurisdiction of this ordinance.
      (2)   In the event of any proposed amendment to this Zoning Ordinance
which is in contradiction to the Comprehensive Plan, such amendment shall be
preceded by an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan.

§ 161.312 A-G GENERAL AGRICULTURE.
   (A)   A-G Land Use District Statement of Intent. It is the intent of this
district to provide land for purposes devoted primarily to the production of
agricultural products such as field crops, livestock, fowl and other
conventional agricultural pursuits. This district is also created to assist in
the conservation of the natural resources within the jurisdiction of this
ordinance by encouraging practices which will conserve soil, soil resources,
water, water resources, and prevent soil erosion and floodwater damages.
Utilities other than electricity and telephone should be provided by the land
user thereby discouraging the uneconomical extension of public water supply and
sewage disposal facilities. Uses not related to Agriculture are discouraged.
When the public interest will be served and only when a contribution will be
made to orderly growth, portions of this district may be rezoned for
alternative uses.

§ 161.313 F-P FLOOD PLAIN.
   (A)   F-P Land Use District Statement of Intent. It is the intent of this
district to delineate reasonable high water marks within the jurisdiction of
this ordinance. For reasons of health, safety and the general welfare, it is in
the public interest to permit only limited types of uses within these areas
which are subject to flooding and require emergency services. A factor
recognized in determining reasonable high water marks is that as urban land use
increases, storm water runoff will also tend to increase, consequently taxing
the water carrying capacity of certain low lying areas within the jurisdiction
of this ordinance. The development of roads, streets, highways, water and sewer
lines are discouraged in this district, as such improvements would tend to
encourage further developments.

§ 161.319 B-1 PRIMARY BUSINESS.
   (A)   B-1 Land Use District Statement of Intent.
      (1)   This district is the location of the most valuable land in the
community, and in its establishment the aims are to protect this community
created value by: restricting uses to primarily pedestrian oriented traffic;
discouraging uses requiring large areas of land in proportion to pedestrian
traffic generated; encouraging intense land development. Uses in this district
should be: predominantly retail; public or private offices; appropriate types
of personal and business services. Residential uses are discouraged in this
district except for hotels.
      (2)   Off-street parking in this district except in conditional uses is
encouraged through the development of private and/or public parking facilities
which are consolidated and/or of adequate size and lend themselves to better
traffic control and more efficient use of land.
      (3)   The provisions for off-street loading facilities are intended to
avoid congestion in the streets which would otherwise hamper the normal flow of
traffic resulting from trucks and delivery vehicles double parking.
Consequently, off-street loading requirements are encouraged but not required
in this district when access to public alley exists.

space demands of the auto oriented shopper, and to provide space for continued
growth of such commercial facilities adjacent to or near major thoroughfares.

(including accessory or supplemental uses) in this district provide an
appropriate amount of off-street parking and loading facilities.

hamper the flow of thoroughfare traffic.

§ 161.321 B-3 INTERCHANGE BUSINESS.
   (A)   B-3 Land Use District Statement of Intent. This district is created to
serve predominantly the needs of interregional vehicular traffic at
interchanges on limited access arterial thoroughfares. The uses allowed in this
district should be limited to the needs of the interregional traveler which
are: food, service, fuel and lodging. The basic purpose of limiting the land
uses in this district is to preserve and enhance the other business district(s)
of the community (or nearby communities) by preventing the establishment of a
shopping center which would compete with existing or proposed (and justified)
shopping centers which cater or will cater to the needs of the community. The
land for this district should be compact (not strip type). In any development
plan, access points should be limited to minimize hazardous driving conditions.

§ 161.323 I-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL.
   (A)   I-1 Land Use District Statement of Intent.
      (1)   This district is established to provide space for certain types of
industrial and/or manufacturing and/or warehousing or storage operations which
are compatible to adjoining districts. Such uses generally require open storage
of materials or goods either before, during or after the manufacturing process,
but are of a low noise or nuisance level. Such uses shall be conducted entirely
within an enclosed building of substantial construction. Land designated for
this district should be located in relation to the thoroughfare network of the
community as well as rail and air if required, and designated so as to not
disrupt normal traffic flow. Because of increased technological developments,
extensive lists of permitted and prohibited uses is impractical, therefore, to
safeguard the public interests, performance standards are established herein as
criteria for all permitted uses and as guidance for the Planning Commission in
permitting any conditional uses. Planned Industrial Parks are encouraged in
this district.
      (2)   This district also provides space for sexually oriented business so
as to minimize secondary effects of sexually oriented business on residential,

liability.
   (C)   Variances to the building protection requirements of §
161.346 of this ordinance which are requested in connection with
reconstruction, repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure
as defined in “Historic Structures”, may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of §§
161.346 and
161.347 of this ordinance subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.

Wireless Communication Facility co-location:
   (A)   A permittee shall cooperate with other Wireless Communication Facility
providers in co-locating additional antennae on support structures and/or on
existing buildings and sites provided said proposed co-locatees have received a
permit for such use at said site from the City. A permittee shall allow other
providers to co-locate and share the permitted site, provided such shared use
does not give rise to a substantial technical level impairment of the permitted
use (as opposed to a competitive conflict or financial burden).
   (B)   A signed statement indicating that the applicant agrees to allow for
the potential co-location of additional Wireless Communication Facility
equipment by other providers on the applicant’s structure or within the same
site location shall be submitted by the applicant as part of the permit

facility owner within ninety (90) days of the date the site’s use is
discontinued, it ceases to be operational, the permit is revoked, or if the
facility falls into disrepair or is abandoned. Disrepair includes structural
features, paint, landscaping, or general lack of maintenance which could result
in safety or visual impacts; and
   (B)   If the provider fails to remove the facility upon ninety (90) days of
its discontinued use or abandonment or disrepair, the responsibility for
removal falls upon the landowner on which the facility has been located. If any
facility is not removed within said ninety (90) days same shall constitute a

emissions. Within six (6) months after the issuance of its operational permit,
the applicant shall submit a project implementation report which provides
cumulative field measurements of radio frequency (EMF) power densities of all
antennas installed at the subject site. The report shall quantify the EMF
emissions and compare the results with established Federal standards. Said
report shall be subject to review and approval by the City for established
Federal standards. Said report shall be subject to review and approval by the
City for consistency with the project proposal report and the adopted Federal
standards. If on review the City finds that the Wireless Communication Facility
does not meet Federal standards, the City may revoke or modify the permit. The

conditional use may be denied on grounds that radio frequency admissions are
harmful to the environment or to the health of residents.
   (B)   The applicant shall ensure that the Wireless Communication Facility
will not cause localized interference with the reception of area television or
radio or data broadcasts. If on review of a registered complaint the City finds
that the Wireless Communication Facility interferes with such reception, the
City may revoke or modify the permit. The applicant shall be given a reasonable
time based on the nature of the problem to correct the interference. If the
permit is revoked, then the facility shall be removed pursuant to §
161.372.

wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy
the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 C.F.R. 22.970 through 47 C.F.R. 22.973 and 47 C.F.R. 90.672
through 47 C.F.R. 90.675.
         (e)   The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility

including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      (7)   Alternate Placements.
         (a)   Except as provided in this Collocation Requirements and
Conditions Section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation
small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility
poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility
pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small
wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or
existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed
collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the
alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate
location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material
costs as determined by the applicant.
         (b)   If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the
applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights,
technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not
satisfy the criteria in this paragraph.

on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
City, provided the City may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
            2.   45 feet above ground level.
      (9)   Height Exceptions or Variances. If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a Variance in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions
set forth in §
161.120.

      (13)   Collocation Completion Deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the City grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (D)   Application Fees. Application fees are imposed as follows:
      (1)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650 for an application
to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or

§ 1 INTRODUCTION AND INSTRUCTIONS.
Intent:
The intent of the design review process is to identify the City’s expectations
with regard to the design of commercial buildings and to provide a consistent
framework that facilitates the review and approval of commercial buildings in a
cost-effective and timely manner. The Commercial Design Handbook promotes
architecture that fits within and contributes to the character and context of
the City’s existing commercial districts. The guidelines are meant to help
achieve good design, not a certain stylistic result. The Commercial Design
Handbook establishes criteria for building design and the established site plan
review process. The Handbook breaks commercial architecture into seven (7)
general elements. Each of the elements includes an intent and architectural
design guidelines. Sketches, photographs and descriptive captions are used to
aid in the understanding of the preferred design solutions and illustrate
design solutions to avoid.
The Handbook does not dictate solutions, but rather provides general guidelines
and examples intended to help guide developers in making decisions for a
variety of specific design issues. The guidelines should be interpreted with a
degree of flexibility to better respond to the varying conditions and
constraints inherent to individual sites and complexities of commercial
development. The Handbook is intended to assist designers, developers and
owners in the preparation of development proposals and assist the City’s
elected and appointed decision-makers in the review and consideration of
commercial applications. The Commercial Design Handbook is based on the City’s
Comprehensive Plan commercial design goals and objectives. There is no intent
to create an architectural review board or additional layer of review.
Key Objectives:
The goal of the Commercial Design Handbook is to enhance the visual character
of the City’s commercial districts by promoting better architecture. The
objectives of the Commercial Design Handbook are to:
   1.   Serve as a predictable guide for change that provides the needed
flexibility to respond to conditions and constraints inherent to specific sites
and evolving trends in commercial development.
   2.   Balance the economic requirements of the development with aesthetic
concerns of the community.
   3.   Create an attractive physical environment for businesses that
encourages sustainable building practices.
   4.   Promote architectural continuity and building designs that are
adaptable to multiple uses for extended building lifecycles.
    5.   Convey a sense of human scale by strengthening the pedestrian
environment through the use of pedestrian features, landscaping and meaningful
outdoor spaces that relate to one another.
When Required:
Commercial developments that require site plan review, particularly as part of
a planned use or special use permit, would be subject to these general
guidelines. Please note that other city regulations and ordinances may also
influence the proposed design of future projects, such as:
   1.   City building codes
   2.   Americans with Disabilities Act & Illinois Accessibility Code
   3.   NPDS Phase I & Phase II Requirements
   4.   Scott Air Force Base Joint Land Use Study Recommendations
   5.   Use of Economic Incentives
Procedures:
The design review process starts with a pre-application meeting with City
staff. The intent of the pre-application meeting is to inform the petitioner of
the City’s site plan and building design review procedures and familiarize the
City with the proposed development. As part of the preliminary review, the
petitioner should provide a conceptual sketch of the proposed building(s) and a
general description of the development including the proposed use or uses,
furnished floor area, building height, number of stories, proposed construction
type and proposed building materials.
After the pre-application meeting, the petitioner may submit the necessary
items for review pursuant to the City’s Site Development Plan review
procedures. The review of a proposed building’s design would typically occur
during the general site plan review rather than through a separate track to
help expedite the project in a timely manner. Applications should include the
following:
   1.   A site plan containing the information required pursuant to the City’s
Zoning Code.
   2.   Architectural elevations showing the proposed exterior building design
and materials, including dimensions.
   3.   Sections of the site showing the existing and proposed grade elevations
and building heights.
   4.   Boards showing samples of exterior building material samples, building
colors, finishes and materials may be provided to better illustrate proposed
design concepts.

The intent of the architectural scale and mass guidelines is to utilize a
building’s massing, façade, windows and entryways to create an identifiable
order of horizontal and vertical elements. Negative visual impacts arising from
the scale, bulk and mass inherent to large buildings and shopping centers
should be mitigated through the application of these guidelines.
Guidelines:
Massing should relate to the site and be consistent or compatible with the
scale, form and proportion of existing development in the immediate area by
addressing the following guidelines:
1.   Break up the Façade. The use of recesses and projections should be used to
create articulations and shadow lines that help break up the massing of large
buildings. The minimum depth of a recessed or projected surface should be one
foot and the minimum width should be five feet.
2.   Integration. Large buildings should integrate features along façades
visible from the public right-of-way and pedestrian routes and entries to
reduce the apparent building mass and achieve an architectural scale consistent
with other nearby structures.
3.   Base, Middle & Top Proportions: The vertical mass in multi-story buildings
should be divided into smaller scale components that include a base, middle and
top to reduce the perceived height and create architectural interest. First
floors should be taller than upper floors and differentiated architecturally to
create a sense of human scale.
4.    Window & Entryway Treatments. Provide window and entryway treatments in
façades visible from streets to reinforce the human scale and create
architectural interest. Windows and doors should include decorative mullions,
lintels, sills, glazing, and framing details. (See also Section 2.3.)
5.   Architectural Elements: The mass of large buildings can be made more
visually interesting by incorporating architectural components such as awnings,
balconies, bay windows, dormers, building-mounted lighting fixtures or sconces,
cornices and parapets.
6.   Rooflines: A distinctive roofline can reduce perceived building height and
mass, increase compatibility with smaller scale and/or residential development,
and add interest to the overall design of the building. (See also Section 2.7.)
7.   Materials: When there is a change in the building plane, consider a change
in the building materials, colors, or patterns. (See also Section 2.5.)
8.   Landscaping: Provide trees complimented with low lying bushes and
perennials that relate to the architectural massing of the façade and provide
seasonal color, contrast and texture.
9.   Tenant Liners: In shopping centers with anchor tenants, the use of smaller
tenant spaces lining the entrances of street-facing façades should be used to
reduce the apparent bulk by breaking-up the overall building façade. (See also
Section 2.3.)

§ 2.2 360° ARCHITECTURE.
Intent:
The intent of the 360º architectural guidelines is to reinforce the established
pattern and design of buildings and create buildings that provide a consistent
architectural quality and character on all building faces, except those not
visible from a public right-of-way.
Guidelines:
1.   Architectural treatments (e.g., materials, colors, façade design, roof
lines) and the use of screening devices (walls, fences, berms, landscaping)
should be consistent and compatible on all sides when visible from a public
right-of-way.
2.   Building materials used on a primary façade should continue for a distance
of no less that two feet on the adjoining side or rear elevation.
3.   Building faces not visible from a public street or right-of-way may
utilize materials other than those used on the primary façade. However, the
material selection and overall design should be durable and maintain a unified
appearance with the primary façade.
4.   Service elevations should utilize landscape buffering and screening to
shield views from public right-of-way and adjacent properties.
5.   All buildings located on a parcel fronting a street should be oriented
toward the street and contain an identifiable entrance.
6.    Building setbacks should reflect the existing setbacks of neighboring
buildings. To best reflect the setbacks of existing development the average
setback of the neighboring buildings should be used.
7.   In undeveloped areas buildings should maintain a zero setback from the
street, except portions of the façade may be notched, recessed or extruded to
accentuate entrances, dining areas, window displays and outdoor display area,
when permitted.
8.   All electrical and mechanical equipment on or near a building should be
screened from view or isolated so as not to be visible from any public right of
way. Such screens and enclosures should be treated as integral elements of the
building’s appearance.
9.   Loading docks, trash enclosures, outdoor storage and other accessory
structures and uses should be incorporated into the overall design of the
building to maintain a unified appearance.

§ 2.3 WINDOWS & ENTRYWAYS.
Intent:
The main entrance should be the primary focal point of the building. Entryways
and windows should be used to provide views of merchandise and business
operations, provide casual surveillance and take advantage of the sun’s passive
solar energy and natural light.
Guidelines:
1.   The path of entry should be perpendicular to the front property line.
2.   Main building entries should be parallel to the front property line and
include a well defined entryway such as a recessed entrance, protruding
entrance, truncated corner entryway or other design that creates a well-defined
entry.
3.   Building faces fronting a street or public right-of-way should incorporate
a combination of awnings, building-mounted lighting, pedestrian level display
windows, storefronts and entrances.
4.   Each floor of any building façade facing a street should contain
transparent windows that allow views of indoor nonresidential space or product
display areas. Windows should cover at least 20% of the wall area, but no more
than 70%.
5.   Upper story windows should be vertically aligned with the location of
windows and doors on the ground level, including storefront or display windows.
6.   Decorative lintels, sills, glazing, door design, moldings or framing
details should be used on windows and entryways located on façades facing
public streets to create architectural interest and enhance the pedestrian
realm. Window treatment should be as follows:
   A.   Windows should be surrounded by trim, molding and/or sill at least four
inches wide. Stone or masonry lintels and sills should be incorporated in
masonry and stucco clad buildings. Wood trim should be incorporated into wood
clad buildings.   
   B.   Commercial buildings with no trim or molding should have window frames
at least two inches wide.    
   C.   Multiple-paned windows should be used to help create visual
interest.   
7.   The following approaches should be considered for all large-scale retail
development to break up the architectural massing of large unadorned walls and
enhance the visual appearance of building frontages.
   A.   Line the primary façades of anchor tenants with smaller tenants, each
having their own entrance and at least one window.
   B.   Provide minor storefronts for each department of a big box user. Each
storefront should physically express internal functions/departments (i.e. food
court, bank, pharmacy, florist, etc.) and have its own entrance and at least
one window.

§ 2.4 AWNINGS & CANOPIES.
Intent:
Canopies, awnings and similar features that create shade, protect buildings and
users from the elements and physically and visually identify points of entry
are encouraged.
Guidelines:
All building façades with an entrance fronting a street should provide an
overhead canopy, enclosure or other building projection or recess designed as
an integral part of the building entrance as follows:
1.   Canopies should be of a color and texture that compliments the
architectural design of the façade.
2.   Canopies should be open to light and air and provide a transition from
outdoor space to indoor space.
3.   Canopies should be constructed of durable, low maintenance materials that
provide weather and sun protection. Fabric, plastic or other non-durable
materials should be maintained in “like-new” condition.

§ 2.5 BUILDING MATERIALS & DETAILS.
Intent:
The intent of the building materials and details guidelines is to promote the
use of complimentary exterior building materials that are durable and have a
lasting architectural character.
Guidelines:
1.   A minimum of 50% of all building surfaces should consist of one or more of
the following materials:
   A.   Stone material consisting of granite, sandstone, slate, limestone or
other durable all-weather stone.
   B.   Brick material composed of hard red (kiln red) all-weather brick or
other durable all-weather facing brick.
   C.   Stucco or approved gypsum concrete or plaster materials.
   D.   Wood lap siding or fiber-cement lap siding that offers an architectural
appearance that is equivalent to the quality and durability of the materials
listed above.
2.   The use of external insulating furnishing system (EIFS), corrugated metal,
coated metal siding, aluminum siding, and vinyl siding should be limited to
accent features only. EIFS and vinyl siding should not be used on the base of
the building façade or other areas where it could be easily damaged by yard
equipment or constant contact by vegetation or pedestrians.
3.   The use of highly reflective or glossy materials or coatings should be
limited to building accents only.
4.   Site lighting, security lighting and architectural/landscape lighting that
provides the user with illumination levels appropriate for the designed use is
encouraged as follows;
   A.   Illumination levels should be uniform throughout the site, minimize
glare and avoid light that is projected on adjacent properties.    
   B.   Up-lighting and down-lighting should be used to highlight architectural
features and compliment other site features and pedestrian use areas.
   C.   All lighting should include shields to more efficiently utilize the
light source by controlling the direction and glare.
   D.   Excessive lighting that restricts star gazing, contributes to light
pollution, unnatural sky glow and wastes energy is discouraged.    
5.   Black coated, decorative or period lighting is recommended. “Cobra-head”
lighting fixtures are not appropriate for on-site lighting.
6.   All exterior building materials and lighting should be complimentary and
selected from a consistent palette used throughout the development, except on
service façades that do not face a public right-of-way.
7.   When there is a change in the building plane, consider a change in the
building materials, colors, or patterns to create visual interest and break up
the massing.

§ 2.6 CORNICES AND PARAPETS.
Intent:
A cornice and parapet wall should be used to visually terminate an exterior
wall on a flat-roofed building. A cornice provides protection to the exterior
façade that a pitched roof overhang would normally provide and helps transition
the vertical wall plane and the horizontal roof plane.
Guidelines:
1.   Flat roofs should incorporate a cornice into street-facing façades.
2.   Cornices should wrap a minimum of 2 feet around exterior corners.
3.   Simple parapets with a stone or brick cap are acceptable for rear and side
elevations.
4.   Flat roofs projecting from a street-facing façade should include a cornice
around the entire projection.
5.   The dimensions, style and proportions of cornices and parapets should be
consistent with the other architectural façade and roof elements.

§ 2.7 ROOF & EAVES.
Intent:
Roofs should be simple forms such as hip, flat, shed or gable. Eaves should
provide a transition between the façade and roof planes and provide overhangs
that offer protection from the elements and create visual interest. A
distinctive roofline can reduce perceived building height and mass, increase
compatibility with smaller scale and/or residential development, and add
interest to the overall design of the building.
Guidelines:
1.   Building rooftops should have the following features:
   A.   Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment and/or;
   B.   Overhanging eaves.
2.   Roofline offsets should be provided to lend architectural interest and
variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single,
long roof. The use of alternating dormers, stepped roofs, gables or other roof
elements should be used to add visual relief and physically break up the
massing of the overall façade.
3.    Flat-roofed designs should include architectural details such as cornices
and decorative eaves to provide interest to the roofline. (See also Section 2.8
Cornices and Parapets.)
4.   Excessive slopes or changes in the horizontal or vertical roof plane are
discouraged.
