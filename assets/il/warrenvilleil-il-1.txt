the loose-leaf type of binding together with the continuous supplement service,

provided it is not beyond the date of the next regular council meeting. No

address at which such notice may be given. (Ord. 2572, 4-5-2010)
   D.   Open Meetings And Executive Sessions: All meetings of the council,
committees and subcommittees, must be open to the public. Executive sessions
may be called for portions of meetings in order to consider matters for which a
public body may hold closed meetings pursuant to 5 Illinois Compiled Statutes
120/2, as now existing or hereafter amended.
An executive session may be held in conjunction with a regular or special
meeting, or may be held independent of any public meeting. A motion should be

business to be discussed at the executive session with an appropriate citation

by majority vote, to adjourn or recess the council to another time or date
prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting.
A majority of the city council shall constitute a quorum. The mayor is to be
counted in determining whether a quorum is present. Acts done by the council
without a quorum are void. A quorum must be present not only to begin a
meeting, but also at the time of a roll call vote on any proposition.
If no quorum is present and the members present desire to compel the attendance
of absent members, they themselves, or by their agents, shall attempt to
communicate the call to the session personally to the absentees. Any absent
member who refuses to attend the meeting (or a new meeting to which the members

chairman shall vote on all questions on which the vote is taken by yeas and
nays. When a vote is taken, the name of the presiding officer shall be called
last. The mayor pro tem shall have all the duties and power of the mayor; the

presiding officer. (Ord. 1729, 11-16-1998; amd. Ord. 1909, 6-4-2001)

all members holding office.
In the voting upon of all ordinances and upon any resolutions or motions, the

the council. The official copy of any ordinance will list the names of each
person voting and how he voted.
An alderman is not required to vote on a motion, resolution or ordinance. His

the majority of those exercising their franchise are in favor of the motion or
resolution.
The mayor is required to vote on three (3) occasions:
      1.   Where the vote of the aldermen has resulted in a tie;

an ordinance, resolution or motion, even though there is no tie vote; or

required by state statutes to adopt an ordinance, resolution or motion. (Ord.
469, 10-5-1979)
Any vote provided for under the Illinois municipal code or state statute that
does not specify whether it shall be a concurring vote or an affirmative vote
shall be considered an affirmative vote. In such an instance, an abstention, a
pass or a recusal of a member of the corporate authorities in response to a
roll call vote on a matter shall be recorded as such and shall not be counted
as a vote with the majority. (Ord. 1861, 7-17-2000)
   C.   Approval And Veto Of Ordinances, Resolutions And Motions: All
resolutions and motions: 1) which create any liability against the city, or 2)
which provide for the expenditure or appropriation of its money and all
ordinances, passed by the city council, shall be deposited with the city clerk.
If the mayor approves them, he shall sign them. Those of which he disapproves
he shall return to the city council, with his written objections, at the next
regular meeting of the city council occurring not less than five (5) days after
their passage.
The mayor may disapprove of any one or more sums appropriated in any ordinance,
resolution or motion making an appropriation and, if so, the remainder shall be
effective.
If the mayor fails to return any ordinance or any specified resolution or
motion with his written objections within the designated time, it shall become
effective despite the absence of his signature.
   D.   Overriding The Veto Of The Mayor: A motion may be made to override the
veto of the mayor. In order to override the veto of the mayor, two thirds (2/3)
of the aldermen then holding office are required to pass the motion with an
affirmative vote. The ordinance, resolution or motion shall then become
effective. (Ord. 469, 10-5-1979)
   E.   Reconsideration Of Actions By The Council: The council may reconsider
its votes and actions upon questions before it and rescind its previous
actions, with the following exceptions:
      1.   No vote of the city council shall be reconsidered or rescinded at a
special meeting, unless there are present at the special meeting as many
aldermen as were present when the vote was taken.
      2.   The council cannot reverse, at a subsequent meeting, its initial
decision to accept or reject the recommendation of an advisory body required in
its deliberations to hold a public hearing without ordering another public
hearing, especially where the decision to reconsider is motivated by evidence
and information not presented at the first public hearing. (Ord. 2040, 2-18-
2003)
   F.   Visitors: Except during the time allotted for citizens' comments, no
person, other than a member of the council, may address that body, except with
the consent of two (2) of the members present. (Ord. 469, 10-5-1979)
   G.   Debate: The chairman of the committee whose report is under
consideration, as the case may be, shall have the right to open and close the
debate.
No member shall speak longer than ten (10) minutes at any one time, except by
consent of the council; and in closing debate on any question as above
provided, the speaker shall be limited to five (5) minutes, except by special
consent of the council.
While a member is speaking, no member shall hold any private discussion or pass
between the speaker and the chair. (Ord. 2040, 2-18-2003)
   H.   Call Of Member To Order: A member, when called to order by the chair,
shall thereupon discontinue speaking and take his seat and the order or ruling
of the chair shall be binding and conclusive, subject only to the right of

An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order, but an
amendment relating to a different subject shall not be in order.
      4.   Reading Of Ordinance/Resolution: No resolution, ordinance or minutes
need be read prior to consideration but such items may be read in response to a
motion passed seeking such a reading.
      5.   Motion To Substitute: A substitute for any original proposition
under debate or for any pending amendment to such proposition may be
entertained notwithstanding that at such time further amendment is admissible;
and if acceptable by the council by vote, shall entirely supersede such
original proposition or amendment, as the case may be, and cut off all
amendments appertaining thereto.
      6.   Record Of Motions: In all cases where a resolution or motion is
made, the name of the member moving and seconding the same shall be recorded.
      7.   Motion To Call The Previous Question: A motion may be made to call
the previous question. After the second, the chair shall immediately put the
question (since there is no debate), "Shall the question be now put?" If this

council from a ruling of the chair and, if the appeal is seconded, the member
making the appeal may briefly state his reason for the same, and the chair may
briefly explain his ruling.

sustained?" If a majority of the members present vote "no", the decision of the
chair shall be overruled; otherwise it shall be sustained.
   K.   Question Of Personal Privilege: The right of a member to address the
council on a question of personal privilege shall be limited to cases in which
his integrity, character or motives are assailed, questioned or impugned.
   L.   Taking And Entering The Votes: The "yeas" and "nays" upon any question
shall be taken and entered in the journal. When the clerk has commenced to call
the roll of the council for the taking of a vote by "yeas" and "nays", all
debate on the question before the council shall be deemed concluded and during
the taking of the vote a member shall be permitted to briefly explain his vote
and shall respond to the calling of his name by the clerk by answering "yea" or
"nay" as the case may be.
   M.   Censure Of Members; Expulsion Of Members: Pursuant to 65 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/3.1-40-15, any member acting or appearing in a lewd or
disgraceful manner, or who uses opprobrious, obscene or insulting language to
or about any member of the council, or who does not obey the order of the
chair, shall be, on motion, censured by a majority vote of the council. With
the concurrence of two-thirds (2/3) of the aldermen elected, the council may
expel an alderman, but not a second time for the same offense.
   N.   Adoption Of "Robert's Rules Of Order" Newly Revised: The rules of
parliamentary practice comprised in the current edition of "Robert's Rules Of
Order" newly revised, except to the extent modified by the ordinances of the

temporarily suspended, repealed, altered or amended by a two-thirds (2/3) vote
of the council then holding office. (Ord. 2040, 2-18-2003)

The Board of Fire and Police Commissioners has been given the option to require
applicants to possess a public safety resources certification so that it may

contained in the public safety resources certification in place of a written
examination which it would otherwise utilize, and the Physical Agility Profile
contained in the public safety resources certification in place of a physical
agility test which it would otherwise utilize, provided that, if it does so for
one applicant for a given position or list of eligibles, it shall do so for all
applicants for such position or list of eligibles.

consideration of the matter by the city council, may suspend the license of the
game room for a period of not to exceed seven (7) days.
Provided further, that if the mayor has reason to believe that any continued
operation of the game room will immediately threaten the welfare of the
community, he may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for
such conclusion and without further notice or hearing, order the licensed
premises closed for not more than seven (7) days, giving the owner and operator
an opportunity to be heard during that period. In the event that the license to
a game room is revoked either through the revocation of the license of an owner
or operator, no new license for a game room shall be issued for the premises
within a period of one year from the date of the revocation. (Ord. 625, 6-21-

kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the
cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or
service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the
amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for
private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination
point within the city and charges for that portion of the interoffice channels
provided within the city. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel
connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is
located within the jurisdictional boundary of the city, shall be determined by
the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the
interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary
of the city and the denominator of which is the total number of channel
termination points connected by the interoffice channel. However, "gross
charge" shall not include any of the following:
   A.   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
pursuant to: 1) the tax imposed by this chapter, 2) the tax imposed by the
telecommunications excise tax act, 3) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the

222.1 of the public utilities act to the extent of such exemption and during
the period of time specified by the department of commerce and economic

in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under
this chapter has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that

between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the
corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering
such service.
   G.   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a
sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made).
   H.   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication
devices.
   I.   Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the
telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee act.
   J.   Charges for nontaxable services or telecommunications if: 1) those
charges are aggregated with other charges for telecommunications that are
taxable, 2) those charges are not separately stated on the customer bill or
invoice, and 3) the retailer can reasonably identify the nontaxable charges on
the retailer's books and records kept in the regular course of business. If the
nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the
sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a
combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or
telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the
retailer of the telecommunications.
   INTERSTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that either originate
or terminate outside this state.
   INTRASTATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: All telecommunications that originate and
terminate within this state.
   PERSON: Any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership,

telecommunications through a sale at retail.
   RETAILER: Every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as

not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction
of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment
of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect
such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect
the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in
the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining
a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the
department at its discretion.
   RETAILER MAINTAINING A PLACE OF BUSINESS IN THIS STATE (Or Any Like Term):
Any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a

other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether
such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.

telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection
therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state

parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.
   SERVICE ADDRESS: The location of telecommunications equipment from which
telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications
services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined
location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime
systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined
in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   TAXPAYER: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees,
or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving
telecommunications in the city and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by
this chapter.

ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information
transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service,
private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter,
computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service,
specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any
other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any
other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means,
between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio,
satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this chapter, "private line" means
a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles
the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group
of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other
specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include
value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act
on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other
than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of
telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a
component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail
consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end to end communications.
Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this chapter,
"prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section
2-27 of the retailers' occupation tax act. (Ord. 2696, 2-21-2012, eff. 7-1-
2012)

   A.   The act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the

the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multimunicipal taxation of the act or privilege
that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof
that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall
be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this
section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other
municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the city or receiving in the
municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent
(6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a
retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multimunicipal taxation of the act or
privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon
proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this
state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant
to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax
properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in
a municipality in this state which was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other state or local tax in this state.
   C.   The tax imposed by this chapter is not imposed on such act or privilege
to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States or the state of Illinois, be made the subject of
taxation by the city. (Ord. 2696, 2-21-2012, eff. 7-1-2012)
3-13-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.
   B.   Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 2007, 8-19-2002, eff. 1-1-2003)

telecommunication retailers shall be returned with appropriate forms and
information as required by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified
municipal telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement this
act. (Ord. 2007, 8-19-2002, eff. 1-1-2003)
3-13-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating
or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the
grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale
number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2007, 8-19-2002, eff. 1-1-
2003)

such unit of local government and school district may apply for a refund of the
telecommunications tax that they have paid for the period July 1, 2012 through
December 31, 2012. Thereafter, each such unit of local government and school
district may apply once annually to the city finance director for a refund of
the telecommunications tax they have paid for the previous twelve (12) months.

district shall present evidence of:

and the local tax administrator agree to some other convenient time.
   C.   Every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of the taxpayer's
business or activities, including original source documents and books of entry
denoting the transactions which had given rise or may have given rise to any
tax liability, exemption or deduction. All books shall be kept in the English
language and shall be subject to and available for inspection by the city.
   D.   It is the duty and responsibility of every taxpayer to make available
its books and records for inspection by the city. If the taxpayer fails to
provide the documents necessary for audit within the time provided, the local
tax administrator may issue a tax determination and assessment based on the tax
administrator's determination of the best estimate of the taxpayer's tax
liability.
   E.   If an audit determines there has been an overpayment of locally imposed
and administered tax as a result of the audit, written notice of the amount of
overpayment shall be given to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days of the local
tax administrator's determination of the amount of overpayment.
   F.   In the event a tax payment was submitted to the incorrect local
governmental entity, the local tax administrator shall notify the local

of a determination of tax due or assessment may file with the local tax
administrator a written protest and petition for hearing, setting forth the

(45) days of receipt of the written notice of the tax determination and
assessment.

tax administrator shall fix the time and place for hearing and shall give
written notice to the taxpayer. The hearing shall be scheduled for a date
within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the written protest and petition for
hearing, unless the taxpayer requests a later date convenient to all parties.

forty five (45) day period, the tax determination, audit or assessment shall
become a final bill due and owing without further notice.
   E.   Upon the showing of reasonable cause by the taxpayer and the full
payment of the contested tax liability along with interest accrued as of the
due date of the tax, the local tax administrator may reopen or extend the time
for filing a written protest and petition for hearing. In no event shall the
time for filing a written protest and petition for hearing be reopened or
extended for more than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the forty five
(45) day period. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-10: HEARING:
   A.   Whenever a taxpayer or a tax collector has filed a timely written
protest and petition for hearing under section
3-16-9 of this chapter, the local tax administrator shall conduct a hearing
regarding any appeal. The local tax administrator may choose to have the
hearing held before a hearing officer who shall then carry out the duties of
the local tax administrator. Likewise, the taxpayer may request that a hearing
officer conduct the hearing rather than the local tax administrator.
   B.   No continuances shall be granted except in cases where a continuance is
absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the taxpayer. Lack of preparation
shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance granted shall not
exceed fourteen (14) days.
   C.   At the hearing the local tax administrator/hearing officer shall
preside and shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the tax
determination, audit or assessment, and each party shall be granted an
opportunity to cross examine any adverse witnesses. The strict rules of
evidence applicable to judicial proceedings shall not apply.
   D.   After the conclusion of the hearing, but in no case later than seven
(7) days, the local tax administrator/hearing officer shall make a written
determination on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing. The
taxpayer or tax collector shall be provided with a copy of the written
decision. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-11: INTEREST AND PENALTIES:
In the event a determination has been made that a tax is due and owing, through
audit, assessment or other bill sent, the tax must be paid within the time
frame otherwise indicated.
   A.   Interest: The city hereby provides for the amount of interest to be
assessed on a late payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of any tax, or any
installment payment due on an installment contract as provided for in section
3-16-13 of this chapter, to be the underpayment rate established under section
6621 of the internal revenue code, or any successor or amendatory law thereto.
   B.   Late Filing And Payment Penalties: If a tax return is not filed within
the time and manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance, a late filing
penalty of five percent (5%) of the amount of tax required to be shown as due
on a return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent (5%)
of the tax due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or
manner provided by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the city issuing
a notice of tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file
penalty shall be assessed equal to twenty five percent (25%) of the total tax
due for the applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be
filed. A late filing or late payment penalty shall not apply if a failure to
file penalty is imposed by the local tax administrator. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-12: ABATEMENT:
The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any
filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local
tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure
to make a filing or payment. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-13: INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS:
The city may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or
fails to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with
the local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without
further notice to the taxpayer. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The city, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in
a timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and owing as promptly
as possible.
   A.   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four (4)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed for the calendar year in which the return for the
applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   B.   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period
for which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the
city, the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six (6) years after the end of the calendar
year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar
year in which the return for the applicable period was filed, whichever occurs
later.
   C.   No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was
filed by the taxpayer. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-15: VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:
For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the date
of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-16: PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES:
Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published in one of the manners
provided by law. The posting of a tax ordinance on the internet shall satisfy
the publication requirements. Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made
available to the public upon request at the city clerk's office. (Ord. 1896, 2-
20-2001)
3-16-17: INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE:
The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If lien is determined to be improper,
the local tax administrator shall:
   A.   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   B.   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   C.   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord.
1896, 2-20-2001)
3-16-18: APPLICATION:
This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all of
the city tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in conflict
with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be controlling.

cleanup bond and a hold harmless agreement approved by the city. The

   A.   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be collected from the purchaser
by the person maintaining a place of business in the state who delivers
electricity to the purchaser. This tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser
to the person who delivers the electricity to the purchaser and, if unpaid, is
recoverable in the same manner as the original charge for delivering the
electricity.
   B.   Any tax required to be collected by this chapter and any such tax which
is collected by a person delivering electricity shall constitute a debt owed to
the city by the person delivering the electricity; provided, that the person
delivering electricity shall be allowed credit for such tax related to
deliveries of electricity, the charges for which are written off as
uncollectible; and provided further, that if such charges are thereafter
collected, the delivering supplier shall be obligated to remit such tax.
   C.   Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the purchaser
by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the electricity. Persons
delivering the electricity shall also be authorized to add to such gross charge
an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the tax to reimburse the person
delivering electricity for the expenses incurred in keeping records, billing
customers, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data
to the city upon request. If the person delivering electricity fails to collect
the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax

shall not be authorized to add the gross charge of up to three percent (3%) of
the tax otherwise permitted in this chapter to that purchaser's invoice.
   D.   If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not
due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as a result of a mistake of
fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax
due, or to become due, under this chapter from the taxpayer or tax collector
who made the erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid shall
be so credited or refunded unless a claim is filed within the time period set
forth in ordinance 1896 as now existing or hereafter amended.
   E.   No action by the city to recover any amount of tax due under the
provisions of this chapter shall be commenced unless filed within the time
period set forth in ordinance 1896 as now existing or hereafter amended. (Ord.
2672, 10-3-2011)

electricity under this chapter:
   A.   All units of local government and school districts whose territory, or
a part thereof, is included within the corporate limits of the city shall be
exempt from the aforesaid city tax.
   B.   Electricity that is delivered to a person who has an active resale
number issued by the city administrator (or his or her designee) and furnishes
that number to the person who delivers the electricity, and certifies to that
person under oath that the sale is entirely or partially nontaxable as a sale
for resale shall be exempt from the aforesaid city tax, subject to the
following conditions:
      1.   Application For Resale Number; Issuance: If a person who receives
electricity in the city claims to be an authorized reseller of electricity,
such person shall apply to the city administrator (or his or her designee) for
a resale number. Such applicant shall state, under oath, all facts which will
show the city why such applicant is not liable for the tax imposed by this
chapter on any such purchases of electricity and shall furnish additional
information as the city may reasonably require. Upon approval of the
application, the city administrator (or his or her designee) shall assign a
resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to the applicant.
      2.   Cancellation Of Resale Number: The city administrator (or his or her
designee) may cancel any resale number that is obtained through
misrepresentation, or which is used to obtain electricity used or consumed by
such person tax free when such actions are, in fact, not for resale, or that no
longer applies because such person has discontinued making resales.
      3.   Partial Resale: Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a reseller has
acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale, the
reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this chapter directly to the city on the
amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect the
tax and remit the tax on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to
a purchaser. Any person who delivers electricity to a reseller having an active
resale number and complying with all other conditions of this chapter shall be
excused from collecting and remitting the tax on any portion of the electricity
delivered to the reseller; provided, that such person reports to the city
administrator (or his or her designee) the total amount of electricity
delivered to the reseller, and such other information that the city
administrator (or his or her designee) may reasonably require. (Ord. 2739, 8-

   B.   Every tax collector filing returns pursuant to this section shall, at
the time of filing such return, pay the city finance director the amount of the
tax imposed by this chapter.
   C.   If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from the
purchaser because the purchaser is partially exempt from the tax pursuant to
this chapter, then the partially exempt purchaser shall file a monthly tax
return with the city that identifies the partially exempt purchaser's name and
principal place of business, the amount of electricity used or consumed, and
the tax owed. The partially exempt purchaser shall pay the tax directly to the
city on or before the last day of the month following the month during which
the electricity is used or consumed.

purchaser, then the purchaser shall file a monthly tax return with the city
that identifies the purchaser's name and principal place of business, the
amount of electricity used or consumed, and the tax owed. The purchaser shall
pay the tax directly to the city on or before the last day of the month
following the month during which the electricity is used or consumed. The tax
collector shall also remain liable for the tax as provided in section

4-3-6: SALE OR DISPLAY OF HARMFUL MATERIALS TO MINORS:
   A.   Elements Of The Offense: A person who, with knowledge that a person is
a child, that is, a person under eighteen (18) years of age, or who fails to
exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a child, knowingly
distributes to or sends or causes to be sent to, or exhibits to, or offers to
distribute or exhibit any harmful material to a child, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
   B.   Definitions:
   DISTRIBUTE: Means to transfer possession of, whether with or without
consideration.
   HARMFUL: Material is "harmful" if, to the average person, applying
contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to
prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or
excretion, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in
description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming
social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.
   KNOWINGLY: As used in this section, means having knowledge of the contents
of the subject matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection
which would have disclosed the contents thereof.
   MATERIAL: As used in this section, means any writing, picture, record or
other representation or embodiment.
   C.   Interpretation Of Evidence: The predominant appeal to prurient interest
of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same
general age of the child to whom such material was offered, distributed, sent
or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the
circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is
designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal
of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or probable
recipient group.
In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate the
material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal,
such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can
justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is
in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal. (Ord. 1897, 3-5-2001)
   D.   Penalty: Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be
subject to a fine of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00). (Ord. O2017-75, 12-4-2017)

      1.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any
library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from
circulating harmful material to any person under eighteen (18) years of age,
provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational
purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a
violation of this section that the act charged was committed in aid of
legitimate scientific or educational purposes.
      2.   Nothing in this section shall prohibit any parent from distributing
to his child any harmful material.
      3.   Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance
upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a
defense to any prosecution under this section: A document issued by the Federal
government or any state, county or municipal government or subdivision or
agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's
license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service
Act or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.
      4.   In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in this
section culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material to a
child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the
child by the defendant, his employees or agents, as where the order or request
for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone, or similar means
of communication, and delivery of such harmful material to the child was by
mail, freight, or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any
prosecution for a violation of this section that the advertisement contained
the following statement, or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that
the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he was not under eighteen
(18) years of age and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not under
eighteen (18) years of age:
NOTICE: It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to purchase the
matter herein advertised.
   F.   Child Falsifying Age: Any person under eighteen (18) years of age who
falsely states, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of
eighteen (18) years, or who presents or offers to any person any evidence of
age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of

5-5-2: NOTICE:
Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is
subject to tow and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the police officer
shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the
city. Before or at a time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify
any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is
found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, of
the fact of the impoundment, and of the vehicle and of the owner's right to
request a preliminary impoundment hearing to be conducted under section
5-5-3 of this chapter. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion
of the hearings provided for in sections
5-5-3 and
5-5-4 of this chapter, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the city a
cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and pays the accrued
towing and storage charges. (Ord. 2898, 12-1-2014)
5-5-3: PRELIMINARY HEARING:
If the owner of record of a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter desires
to appeal the impoundment, said owner must make a request for hearing within
twenty four (24) hours of the impoundment. Said request shall be in writing and
filed with the chief of police or his designee, who shall conduct such
preliminary hearing within twenty four (24) hours after receipt of the request,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or city holidays. All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle
impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the
hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type
commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their
affairs. If after the hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines
there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to impoundment
pursuant to this chapter, he shall order the continued impoundment of the
vehicle as provided in this chapter unless the owner of the vehicle posts with
the city a cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and pays
the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief of police or his
designee determines that there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be
returned without penalty or other fees. (Ord. 2898, 12-1-2014)
5-5-4: POSTTOW HEARING:
Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is impounded pursuant to this chapter, the
city shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of
record of the date, time, and location of a posttow hearing that will be
conducted, pursuant to this section. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing officer designated by the city administrator. All interested persons
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time
prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either
party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal
rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs.
If, after the posttow hearing, the hearing officer determines, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the vehicle was used in connection with a
violation set forth in this chapter, the hearing officer shall enter an order
finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the city for an
administrative fee as provided in section
5-5-5 of this chapter and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded
until the owner pays the administrative fee to the city plus fees to the tower
for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record fails to
appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor
of the city. If the hearing officer finds no such violation occurred, the
hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash
bond without fees. The decision of the hearing officer shall be subject to
judicial review in the manner provided by law. (Ord. 2898, 12-1-2014)
5-5-5: ADMINISTRATIVE FEE:
The administrative fee for a vehicle impounded pursuant to this chapter shall
be $500.00; provided however, the administrative fee for a vehicle impounded
pursuant to subsections 5-5-1-A.9, 5-5-1-A.11, 5-5-1-A.12, 5-5-1-A.28, 5-5-1-
A.29, or 5-5-1-A.30 of this chapter shall be $950.00. If an administrative fee
is imposed pursuant to this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt due and
owing the city. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this chapter the
bond shall be applied to the fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a
fee is imposed, the city may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce
such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided
otherwise in this chapter, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the
fee is paid to the city and any applicable towing fees are paid to the tower,
in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is
legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise
disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the
administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30)
days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who
defaults by failing to appear at the posttow hearing, the vehicle shall be
deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the
disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative
fee and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the
expiration of time at which judicial review of the hearing officer's
determination may be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking
judicial review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is
applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in
the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the
Illinois vehicle code. (Ord. 2898, 12-1-2014; amd. Ord. O2024-54, 12-2-2024)
5-5-6: VEHICLE POSSESSION:
   A.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lienholder,
or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle
impounded under this chapter until the administrative fee and fees applicable
under this chapter have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of
record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings,
possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in
writing to refund the city the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure
sale, less any amounts required to pay all lienholders of record, not to exceed
the administrative fee, plus the applicable fees.
   B.   For purposes of this chapter, the "owner of record" of a vehicle is the
record titleholder as registered with the secretary of state of the state of
Illinois. (Ord. 2898, 12-1-2014)

council for a period of not less than thirty (30) days. If after thirty (30)
days the city council takes no action on the proposed rule or regulation, it
shall automatically go into effect. If, however, at anytime during the thirty
(30) day period, the city council acts to overrule the proposed rule or
regulation, it would not go into effect. Such rules shall not have the effect
of waiving structural or fire performance requirements specifically provided
for in this chapter or violating accepted engineering practice involving public
safety.

officers, technical assistants, inspectors and other employees as shall be
necessary for the administration of this chapter and as authorized by the

building; nor shall such officer or employee engage in any work that conflicts
with official duties or with the interests of the community development
department.

and activities of the community development department, and all such records
shall be open to public inspection at all appropriate times and according to
reasonable rules to maintain the integrity and security of such records.

costs in any action, suit or proceeding that is instituted in pursuance of the
provisions of this chapter; and any officer of the community development

the provisions of this chapter to abate a specific violation on which a formal
complaint has been filed with the code official or their designee. Such a
complaint shall specifically identify the alleged violation. To the maximum
extent permitted by law, the names, address or other information identifying
the complainant(s) shall be kept confidential and shall not be made public or

placard whenever the defect or defects upon which the condemnation and
placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any person who defaces or
removes a condemnation placard without the approval of the code official shall
be subject to the penalties provided by this Chapter.

actual or potential danger to the building occupants or those in the proximity
of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the
presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or
dangerous equipment, the code official is hereby authorized and empowered to
order and require the occupants to vacate the premises forthwith. The code
official shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such structure a notice
reading as follows: "This structure is Unsafe and its Occupancy has been
prohibited by the Code Official". It shall be unlawful for any person to enter

required repairs, removing the hazardous condition, or of demolishing the same.
      2.   Temporary Safeguards: Notwithstanding other provisions of this
Chapter, whenever, in the opinion of the code official, there is imminent

materials at the highest price obtainable. The net proceeds of such sale, after
deducting the expenses of such razing and removal, shall be promptly remitted
with a report of such sale or transaction, including the items of expense and

street or alley proposed to be vacated forms a link within a State highway.
   D.   Hearing Required: No ordinance to vacate any street or alley outside
the corporate limits of the City of Warrenville shall be passed without notice
thereof pursuant to subsection E of this section and a hearing thereon by the
Corporate Authorities. At the hearing, all interested persons shall be heard

or owners to acquire title in the vacated portion of the street or alley shall
have paid compensation to the City of Warrenville in an amount which, in the
judgment of the Corporate Authorities, shall be the fair market value of the
property acquired. The fair market value of the right-of- way to be vacated may
be determined by the appraisal (if required), or based on the benefits that
will accrue to the applicant by reason of the requested vacation, or on such
other factors as the Corporate Authorities may determine are in the best
interests of the public health, safety, and welfare. The ordinance shall also
reserve to the City of Warrenville or to any public utility or both, as the
case may be, owning such facilities, such property, rights-of-way, and
easements as, in the judgment of the Corporate Authorities, are necessary or
desirable for continuing public service by means of those facilities and for
the maintenance, renewal and reconstruction thereof. (Ord. O2018-21, 5-21-2018)

7-4C-12: LIEN; FORECLOSURE:
   A.   Delinquent Charges: Delinquent water or sewer charges shall be a lien
on the premises, as provided by law. Whenever a statement for water or sewer
service remains unpaid sixty (60) days after it has been rendered, the city may
file with the recorder of deeds of DuPage County a notice of the lien claim.
This notice shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the
amount of the unpaid statement, and an assertion that the city claims a lien
for this amount as well as for the amount of all charges subsequent to the
period covered by this statement.
If the consumer or user whose statement is unpaid is not the owner of the
premises in question, the finance director shall send to the owner or owners of
record of the real estate, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification
number: 1) a copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is
delinquent in paying the charges or rates or other notice sufficient to inform
the owner or owners of record, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification
number, that the charges or rates have become delinquent and 2) a notice that
unpaid charges or rates may create a lien on the real estate under this
section.
The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting out: 1) a
description of such real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, 2)
the amount of money due for such service, and 3) the date when such amount
became delinquent. The finance director shall send a copy of the notice of the
lien to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as referenced by the
taxpayer's identification number. The city has the power to foreclose this lien
in the same manner and with the same effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages
on real estate.
In addition, the occupant or user of the real estate, or any person or entity
receiving any direct or indirect benefit from such water and sewer services,
including the owner of the real estate and the owner's successors in interest
and assigns, shall be liable for any unpaid delinquent water or sewer charges.
The city also has the power, from time to time, to sue the occupant or user of
the real estate or a person receiving any direct or indirect benefit from such
services, including the owner of the real estate or the owner's successors in
interest or assigns in a civil action to recover the money due for services
rendered, plus a reasonable attorney fee, to be fixed by the court. Whenever a
judgment is entered in such a civil action, the foregoing provisions in this
section with respect to filing sworn statements of such delinquencies in the
office of the recorder and creating a lien against the real estate shall not be
effective thereafter as to charges sued upon and no lien shall exist thereafter
against the real estate for the delinquency. Judgment in such a civil action
operates as a release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the judgment.
(Ord. 2345, 10-2-2006)
   B.   Foreclosure Of Lien: Real estate subject to a lien for unpaid,
delinquent water charges or sewer charges shall be sold for nonpayment of the
same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay such charges, after
deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such
foreclosure shall be made in equity in the name of the city.
The city attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such
proceedings, in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction,
against any real estate as above provided. (Ord. 503, 4-21-1980, eff. 5-1-1980)

(Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
   A.   Authority Granted, No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A
permit from the City authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this chapter on City rights-of-way to the extent
of the City's property rights therein. The permit does not create a property
right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others
who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way, including, without
limitation, such rights as may exist by virtue of 605 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/9-113 (the Illinois Highway Code).
   B.   Duration: No permit under this chapter shall be valid for a period
longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion; provided, however,
that permits for small wireless facilities shall be subject to the duration
provided for SWF permits in section
7-5-21 of this chapter.
   C.   Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant
to a permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and
all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the
permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held
at a date, time and place designated by the City, with such City
representatives in attendance as the City deems necessary. The meeting shall be
for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special
considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without
limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and
their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of
rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by
adjacent property owners.
   D.   Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the City
does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the
City and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
(Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:
In the event the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material
respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications
submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set
of drawings or plans to the City within ninety (90) days after the completion
of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically
identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the
locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with section
7-5-22 of this chapter. If the City denies the request for a variance, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor. (Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-8: INSURANCE:
   A.   Required Coverages And Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the City and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents,
and employees as additional noncontributory insureds on the policies listed in
subsections A1 and A2 of this section. The utility's insurance shall be
primary, and any City policies of insurance shall be deemed secondary.
      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X", "C", and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         a.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death
to each person;
         b.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for property damage
resulting from any one accident; and
         c.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for all other types of
liability;
      2.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) for environmental liability;
      3.   Automobile liability for owned, nonowned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal
injury and property damage for each accident;
      4.   Workers' compensation with statutory limits;
      5.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per employee and per accident; and
      6.   Property insurance for its property replacement cost against all
risks.
   B.   Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may
be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or
umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this section to the City within ten (10) days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the City.
   D.   Maintenance And Renewal Of Required Coverages: The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the
intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
City, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice addressed to the City Administrator of such intent to cancel or
not to renew.
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the City of said notice, and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain
and furnish to the City evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the
requirements of this section.
   E.   Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection A of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection A of this section or the requirements of subsections
B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide
to the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-
insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection
A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-
insurer" under the Workers' Compensation Act. Self-insurance shall be primary,
and any City policies of insurance shall be deemed secondary.
   F.   Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The
legal liability of the utility to the City and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   G.   Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company. (Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-
2018)
7-5-9: INDEMNIFICATION:
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall be
deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the City and its elected and
appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the sole negligence, misconduct or breach of
this chapter by the City, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives. A utility shall also waive any claims it may have against the
City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however
caused, based on the theory of liability. (Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-10: SECURITY:
   A.   Purpose: The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and in
an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be continuously
maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and
expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of
this chapter;
      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the City issued pursuant to this chapter; and
      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the City may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this chapter to perform that the City must perform itself or have
completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the City from the permittee pursuant to
this chapter or any other applicable law.
   B.   Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the City in the
form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable
to the City, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the
City. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
City and the permittee;
      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the City of any amounts covered by it; and
      3.   Shall provide a location convenient to the City and within the State
of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   C.   Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Director of Public Works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the City estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in
phases in multiple locations in the City, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and
where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Director of
Public Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to
post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit. The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
   D.   Withdrawals From Cash Security Funds: The City, upon fourteen (14)
days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention
to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount
from the Security Fund if the fund is a Cash Security Fund, provided that the
permittee has not reimbursed the City for such amount within the fourteen (14)
day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      3.   Fails to reimburse the City for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the City has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the City
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
   E.   Replenishment Of Cash Security Funds: Within fourteen (14) days after
receipt of written notice from the City that any amount has been withdrawn from
the Cash Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Cash Security Fund to
the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
   F.   Interest On Cash Security Funds: The permittee may request that any and
all interest accrued on the amount in the Cash Security Fund be returned to the
permittee by the City, upon written request for said withdrawal to the City,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Cash Security Fund below
the minimum balance required in subsection C of this section.
   G.   Closing And Return Of Cash Security Fund: Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Cash Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the City for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Cash Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become
the property of the City to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the City as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   H.   Other Security Funds: Withdrawals, replenishment, renewal and closing
of letter of credit or surety bond Security Funds shall be governed by the
terms of the letter of credit or surety bond.
   I.   Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the City with respect to the
Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or
exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other
right the City may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be
entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which
may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-11: PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION:

deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the City within five (5) working days after receipt of the
written notice of revocation; or

the deficiencies; 2) upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the
permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less
than thirty (30) days' notice to the permittee of failure to cure the
noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the City. The permittee
shall be liable in all events to the City for all costs of correction, removal
or abandonment. (Ord. O2018-29, 7-16-2018)

rules and regulations, including this chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   B.   Amended Permit: A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or

way.
   C.   Insurance And Bonding: All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer. (Ord. O2018-29,
7-16-2018)
7-5-13: GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS:

      1.   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      2.   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be

be an emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before
the time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
JULIE locate.
      5.   Encasement:
         a.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
City.
         b.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (1') (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No aboveground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the highway.
         c.   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or City approved jointed
pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is installed
prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical
joints are of a type approved by the City. Bell and spigot type pipe shall be
encased regardless of installation method.
         d.   In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less,
encasement may be eliminated.
         e.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated only
if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and
2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.

misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The City will require
compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed without
authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The City may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   C.   Specimen Trees Or Trees Of Special Significance: The City may require
that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.

a utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the
rights-of-way whenever the Corporate Authorities have determined that such
removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any City improvement in
or upon, or the operations of the City in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   B.   Removal Of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any
unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way
shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant
of a license or franchise, if required;
      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this chapter; or
      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.

right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary, appropriate or
useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances
permit, the City shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to
cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after
cutting or removing a facility.
   D.   Abandonment Of Facilities: Upon abandonment of a facility within the
public rights-of-way of the City, the utility shall notify the City within
ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the City may direct the
utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the Director of Public
Works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public
health, safety and welfare. In the event that the City does not direct the
utility that the abandoned facility be removed, the abandoning utility shall be
deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the
facility by another utility or person at the City's sole discretion. (Ord.
O2018-29, 7-16-2018)
7-5-19: CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:

      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the
right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the
Director of Public Works or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the

7-7-1: PURPOSE; APPLICABILITY:
   The purpose of this chapter is to preserve, protect and enhance critical
infrastructure - the urban forest that is located within city right-of-way and
other publicly accessible city-owned property. The complete urban forest is
comprised of trees across all land uses and ownership. This chapter
specifically applies to trees located within city right-of-way or on other
city-owned property dedicated to and available for public use.
   This chapter recognizes that trees located in city right-of-way are a
collective asset to the entire community and identifies and effectuates the
city's goals to protect, preserve, care, and plant trees located in city right-
of-way, including, without limitation:
   A.   Protect, preserve and enhance the quality of life and general welfare
of the city, its residents, and property owners; and conserve and enhance the
city's natural, physical, and aesthetic environment by preserving, protecting,
and enhancing the urban forest that is located within city right-of-way to
ensure that trees are properly planted and maintained.
   B.   Recognize that city right-of-way trees are an integral part of the
infrastructure of the city and, as such, should be preserved, protected and
cared for as other critical city infrastructure.
   C.   Recognize that larger trees provide larger benefits. When a large tree
is removed and replaced with a smaller tree the benefits and services are
reduced.
   D.   Recognize that some trees may have a condition that constitutes a
threat, danger or nuisance to the public or property within the city or may be
dangerous to the health of other trees and vegetation in the city.

LAND DEDICATION FOR PUBLIC USE
SECTION:
8-12-1: Dedication Of Land Or Cash Contribution
8-12-2: Required As A Condition To Annexation
8-12-3: Subdivision Control Ordinance Compliance
8-12-4: Annexation Application Fee
8-12-5: Intergovernmental Agreement
8-12-1: DEDICATION OF LAND OR CASH CONTRIBUTION:
As a condition of the City Council's approval of a final plat of subdivision,
or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer
shall be required to dedicate land for park, recreation, library or Municipal
purposes or land and/or site improvements for school sites, to serve the
immediate and future needs of the projected net increase in population
generated by the subdivision or development, or cash contributions in lieu of
actual land or site improvement dedication, or a combination of both, at the
option of the City. No Municipal official shall affix his or her signature to
an approved final plat of subdivision or a final plat of a planned unit
development until the required land dedication has been made. Cash
contributions shall be required to be paid at time of individual building
permit issuance on a prorated basis, based on the number of bedrooms provided
for in the dwelling unit for which the building permit is sought.
If said building permit represents an increase to the original unit estimate
required under subsection E of this section, additional cash contributions
shall also be required at the time of individual building permit issuance. Land
dedication and cash contribution requirements shall be calculated using the
following criteria and formulas:
   A.   Criteria For Requiring Park, Recreational Or Municipal Land Dedication:
      1.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed
development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for
dedication. The total requirement shall be ten (10) acres of land per one
thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following
classifications:
      POPULATION RATIO CLASSIFICATION TABLE
 
Type Of Recreation Area  Size Range                  Minimum Acres Per 1,000
                                                     People
Play lot                 Minimum 8,000 square feet   n/a
School-park neighborhood Minimum park of 5 acres     2.28
playground
Neighborhood park        Minimum of 3.5 acres        1.8
Districtwide park or     Minimum of 4 acres up to 30 2.28
play field               acres
Community wide           Minimum of 12 acres up to   3.64
recreation park          30 acres
                         Total:                      10 acres of land per 1,000
                                                     people
 
      2.   Location: The Comprehensive Plan as adopted by the City Council
shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A park site adjoining all
elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres shall be considered a
requirement, or Municipal installation of equivalent value located elsewhere
within the City. A central location which will serve equally the entire
development is more desirable. In large developments, these sites can be
located throughout the development according to established standards for park
area distances.
      3.   Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When
subdividers or developers provide their own open spaces for recreation areas
and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public
recreational services. Depending upon the size of the development, a portion of
the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may
at the option of the City Council be provided in the form of "private" open
space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be
determined by the City Council, based upon the needs of the projected residents
and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area.
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply
a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of
recreational facilities, including equipment, by the developer as part of his
obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of
facilities to be installed, must be approved by the City, and before any credit
is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must
guarantee that those private recreation areas will be permanently maintained
for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private
swimming clubs are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private
recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park
land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned
unit development and then subtract the credit to be given.
   B.   Criteria For Library Land Donations:
      1.   Cash Donation: In lieu of land, a cash donation of one hundred
twenty seven dollars ($127.00) for each projected new person shall be required
for library purposes.
      2.   Location: The Comprehensive Library Location Plan as adopted by the
library district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central
location which will serve the entire development and adjacent areas is
desirable.
   C.   Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedication:
      1.   Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to
be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly
upon the amount of land and/or site improvements required to be dedicated for
school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining
the ratio of: a) estimated children to be served in each such school
classification over the b) maximum recommended number of students to be served
in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such
ratio to the c) said minimum recommended number of acres for a school site for
each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be
the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to
serve the estimated increased number of children in each such school
classification.
      2.   School Classification And Size Of School Site: School
classifications and size of school sites within the City shall be determined in
accordance with the following criteria:
 
School             Maximum Number   Minimum Number Of
Classification     Of Students For  Acres Of Land For
By Grades          Each Such School Each School Site
                   Classification   Of Such Classification
Elementary schools 600 students     11 acres
(Grades K - 5)
Middle schools     900 students     19 acres
(Grades 6 - 8)
High schools       2,300 students   48 acres
(Grades 9 - 12)
 
      3.   Location: The standards adopted by the school district shall be used
as a guideline in locating sites.
   D.   Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Municipal And School
Sites: Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be
practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park, recreational
or Municipal purposes or a school site, the City shall require the subdivider
or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication
required. The cash contributions in lieu of park, recreation, or Municipal land
dedication shall be held in trust by the City, solely for the acquisition and
improvement of land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to
serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the improvement of other existing land which already serves
such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in
trust by the City, solely for the use in the acquisition of land and/or site
improvements for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development, or for the improvement of any
existing school land or site improvements thereto which already serves such
needs. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school site dedication
is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within seven (7) years from
the date of receipt, the principal amount thereof, without interest, shall be
refunded to the developer who made such contribution.
      1.   Fair Market Value:
         a.   The cash contributions in lieu of land dedication shall be based
upon the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as
specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park, recreation,
Municipal, library and school sites.
         b.   It is recognized that the present fair market value of such
improved land in and surrounding the City may fluctuate from time to time.
         c.   The City hereby determines that the current "fair market value"
of such improved land is one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) per
acre in the City and adjacent surrounding territory. Said value shall be
utilized for the purposes of this section, except as hereinafter provided.
         d.   The developer may submit an acceptable professional independent
appraisal showing the current fair market value of such improved land per acre,
or other evidence thereof, in the areas of his development. The final
determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be
made by the City Council based upon such information submitted by the
subdivider or developer, and from other sources which may be submitted to the
City Council by the school district or others.
      2.   Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fee: There are situations in
subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication
and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions arise
when:
         a.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the
location for a park, recreation, Municipal or school site. That portion of the
land within the subdivision falling within the park, recreation, Municipal or
school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that
would have been required to be dedicated;
         b.   A major part of the local park, recreation, Municipal or school
site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from
the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required
by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. (Ord.
O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
   E.   Density Formula: The following table of population density is generally
indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new
construction, and shall be used in calculating the amount of required
dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof, unless a
written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. Said
calculations shall initially be based on a written estimate of the number of
new efficiency, one, two (2), three (3), four (4) and five (5) bedroom units
that will be constructed in the subdivision or development (herein referred to
as the "original unit estimate"). The original unit estimate shall be prepared
by the developer or subdivider and must be approved by the Director of
Community and Economic Development as being a reasonable estimate of the type
of new construction anticipated in a specific subdivision or development. (Ord.
O2017-38, 6-19-2017; amd. Ord. O2018-10, 3-19-2018; Ord. 2020-23, 5-18-2020)

Note:
1.      No yield data were generated due to lack of population or no (or very
few) residential units in the sample.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table
of estimated ultimate population listed herein, he shall submit his own
demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated
from the subdivision or planned unit development, and, in that event, final
determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be
made by the City Council, based upon such demographic information submitted by
the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to
the City Council by the school district or others. It is recognized that
population density, age distribution, and local conditions change over the
years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of
fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and
amendment if necessary.
   F.   Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the Comprehensive Plan or the
current standards of the City call for a larger amount of park and recreational
land or library or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit
development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond
the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the
City or other public body designated by the City; provided, that such
acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final
plat.
   G.   Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned
unit development is less than forty (40) acres, public open space, a library
site or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be
combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce
usable park, recreation or Municipal areas, library sites or school sites
without hardship on a particular developer.
   H.   Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site, as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended

   A.   Except as hereinafter provided, that certain document titled "DuPage
County Countywide Stormwater and Floodplain Ordinance", effective May 14, 2019,
(the "County ordinance"), a copy of which is on file in the Office of the City
Clerk, shall be and is hereby adopted as the ordinance for the City regulating
stormwater management, Best Management Practices (BMPs), erosion control, and
floodplain matters within the City; and each and all of the regulations,
provisions, penalties, conditions and terms of said Countywide stormwater and
floodplain ordinance, as amended herein, on file in the Office of the City
Clerk, are hereby referred to, adopted and made part hereof as if fully set

   B.   The following sections of the DuPage County Countywide stormwater and
floodplain ordinance, as effective within the corporate boundaries of the City,
are hereby amended as follows:
      1.   Section 15-55 is amended to add a new subsection E thereto, which
subsection shall hereafter be and read as follows:
15-55.E. Where new stormwater facilities are installed on private property
pursuant to a stormwater management certification (hereinafter referred to as
the certification) issued by the city of Warrenville and as required by this
ordinance and said stormwater facilities are not located in a clearly dedicated
stormwater management easement area or subject to a home owners' association
declaration of covenants satisfying the requirements of 15-55.E.1 through 15-
55.E.4 below, the administrator shall have the authority to require owner of
said private property to execute and submit to the city of Warrenville a
declaration of stormwater facility maintenance agreement and covenant in the
form periodically approved by the Warrenville city council. The executed and
submitted stormwater facility maintenance agreement and covenant shall:
15-55.E.1. Document the owner's responsibility to manage, operate, and maintain
any and every portion of the stormwater facilities required under the
certification in accordance with the provisions of the stormwater facility
maintenance agreement and covenant, this ordinance, and as may be reflected on
the approved as-built drawing(s).
15-55.E.2. Run with the property and shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the owner of the property, the owner's successors, assigns and
grantees, and all parties claiming by, through, and under them.
15-55.E.3. Grant the city the right to enter the property to inspect, and
evaluate the performance of, the stormwater facilities, and, in the event the
city determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that prior maintenance of
the stormwater facilities is not performed at any time, the city, after ten
(10) days prior written notice to the owner, may, but shall not be obligated
to, enter upon the property for the purpose of performing maintenance work on
and to the stormwater facilities.
15-55.E.4. Allow the city to charge the owner an amount sufficient to defray
the entire cost of any work performed pursuant to 15.55.E.3 of this section,
including administrative costs, either before or after such cost is incurred,
and if the amount so charged is not paid by the owner following a demand in
writing by the city for such payment, such charge, together with interest and
costs of collection, shall become a lien upon the property and the city shall
have the right to collect such charge, with interest and costs, and to enforce
such lien as in foreclosure proceedings as permitted by law.
15-55.E.5. Allow the city to enforce the stormwater facility maintenance
agreement and covenant and recover its attorney's fees and costs in any
enforcement action where it is the prevailing party.
15-55.E.6. Become a permanent record in the file maintained by the city of
Warrenville on the property.
15-55.E.7. Be recorded, at the expense of the owner, against the property in
the office of the DuPage County recorder of deeds prior to the city of
Warrenville issuing a full, unconditional, certificate of occupancy permit for
the property.
(Ord. O2018-53, 11-19-2018)
      2.   Section 15-114 is amended to add a new subsection I thereto, which
subsection shall hereafter be and read as follows:
15-114.I. The applicant shall be responsible for all out of pocket costs
incurred by the city for the appeal process including, but not limited to
publication for legal notice, court reporter, transcript, printing, recording
fees and outside city consultants unless the applicant's appeal is upheld by
the oversight committee, in which case the fees for publication of legal
notice, printing, recording and outside city consultants shall be refunded to
the applicant.
(Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017; amd. Ord. O2019-35, 7-1-2019)
8-13-2: ADMINISTRATION:
The City Administrator, or his designee, shall have the authority to administer
this chapter within the corporate boundaries of the City. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-
2017)
8-13-3: FEES:
   The fees for review, issuance and inspection of the stormwater management
certification and recording of required declaration of stormwater facility
maintenance agreement and covenant for approved developments shall be as
follows:
   A.   Application Fee: An application fee shall be charged as set forth in
the annual fee ordinance.
   B.   Inspection Fee: An inspection fee shall be charged as set forth in the
annual fee ordinance.
   C.   Recording Fee: An additional fee, set forth in the annual fee
ordinance, shall be charged when the City’s stormwater management certification
requires a declaration of stormwater facility maintenance agreement and
covenant to be recorded against the applicant’s property. The fee shall be paid
prior to City issuance of the stormwater management certification.
   D.   Additional Fees: Payments shall be made from the application fee for
City services for the review of the document, issuance of the certification and
inspection of installation of the stormwater facilities based on time spent by
staff multiplied by the employee actual hourly rate or consultant’s hourly
rate. Consultants may add a charge for overhead and professional fee. An
additional charge shall be added to the staff or consultant charge for City
administrative and executive services as set forth in the annual fee ordinance.
In the event the amount of the application or inspection fee is exhausted by
such charges, the City, at its discretion, may require the payment of
additional monies for such services.
   E.   Additional Application And Inspection Fees For Development That
Involves Wetland Issues: In order for the City to: 1) review and approve
stormwater management certification applications for development that involves
wetland issues and 2) inspect the installation and establishment of projects
involving wetland issues, the City is required by the DuPage County Countywide
stormwater and floodplain ordinance to utilize the services of special
environmental consultants (i.e., environmental scientists and soil scientists).
Since each development that involves wetland issues has unique circumstances
and challenges and such developments can, by their nature, vary greatly in
complexity, the City has determined that it would not be fair or equitable to
establish a standard flat application and inspection fee for stormwater
certifications that involve wetland issues.
   The applicant/developer shall reimburse the City for all environmental
consulting costs it incurs during the review, approval and inspection of
development that involves wetland issues. Said reimbursement shall be made
within thirty (30) days from the applicant’s/developer’s receipt of an invoice
for said costs from the City. The City’s invoice to the applicant/developer
shall add an additional charge as set forth in the annual fee ordinance. If the
applicant/developer does not pay said City invoices within thirty (30) days of
their receipt, the Director of Community and Economic Development shall be
authorized to: 1) draw on the applicant’s/developer’s letter of credit in the
amount of the unpaid invoice or 2) in cases where there is no letter of credit,
withhold the issuance or revoke previously issued construction and occupancy
permits associated with the development project.

8-13-4: DETENTION/RETENTION POND OUTLOT REQUIREMENTS:
All new detention/retention facilities that serve multiple lot developments
shall be located on a separate outlot that is owned and maintained by an
association created for such purpose unless the City Council approves another
arrangement based on specific unique circumstances or special conditions. Said
outlot shall encompass all required detention/retention pond improvements,
including, but not limited to, required detention/retention pond landscaping
and the detention/retention pond outfall structure. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)

order to prevent wet areas which may kill the intended ground cover or promote
the growth of nuisance plant species.
   B.   Low Flow Pipes And/Or Paved Channels: Low flow pipes and/or paved
channels shall not be permitted. The ends of storm sewers draining runoff into
the detention pond shall be located at least fifty feet (50') away from the
pond outlet to ensure sufficient filtering of contaminants.
   C.   Side Slopes: Vegetated side slopes shall be four to one (4:1) or
flatter. Seeded slopes shall be protected with an approved erosion control mat
designed for that application.
   D.   Retaining Walls: Retaining walls shall not be permitted on more than
fifty percent (50%) of the pond perimeter. Retaining walls shall be constructed
of modular blocks. Retaining walls 3.0 feet or taller shall be designed by a
registered structural engineer or a registered architect. Stepped walls count
as one wall system (e.g., a 2 foot lower wall plus a stepped 2 foot upper wall
equals a 4 foot wall). Safety fencing shall be provided along the top edge of
any retaining wall greater than 3.0 feet in height.
   E.   Bounce: The maximum bounce (high water level minus the outlet invert
elevation) on a detention pond shall be four feet (4').
   F.   Outfall Pipe: The outfall pipe from a detention pond shall be provided
with a flared end section and steel grating.
   G.   Perimeter Berm: For any detention pond at least partially enclosed by
an earthen berm, the top of the berm shall be at least one foot (1') higher
than the design high water level and at least two feet (2') wide.
   H.   Emergency Overflow Weir: An emergency overflow weir shall be provided
at an elevation above the design high water level, and not less than six inches
(6") below the top of berm. The overflow weir shall be armored from the top of
berm to the outside toe of slope. If the weir is armored with riprap or other
porous material, the subgrade under the riprap shall be equal to or above the
design high water level. The weir shall be wide enough to convey one cfs per
tributary acre. Weirs facing adjacent single-family residential properties or
public streets shall be incorporated into the landscape design for the facility
and shall be designed to minimize negative visual impacts by incorporating
landscape stone, grasscrete or an approved equal material in lieu of concrete
or standard riprap.
Requests for relief from the requirements of this section will be processed by
the Oversight Committee. A public hearing or a published legal notice is not
required for any such request unless the request also involves relief from the
requirements of the DuPage County Countywide Stormwater and Floodplain
Ordinance. The applicant will be responsible for payment of any nonrefundable
application fees to appear before the Plan Commission/Oversight Committee.

8-13-10: STORMWATER MANAGEMENT EASEMENT PROVISIONS:
Before construction of any private stormwater detention or retention facility
is commenced, the owner shall grant to the City a stormwater management
easement, either by plat or grant of easement. The stormwater management
easement shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the City Attorney
and shall be substantially in the following form:
Stormwater Management Area Maintenance Provisions
The owner, on behalf of itself, its successors and assigns, and all future
holders of title (collectively, the "owner") to any portion of the property
which is the subject of this plat (the "property"), hereby covenants and agrees
with the city of Warrenville (the "city") as follows:
Owner shall maintain, operate and repair the portions of the property
identified on this plat as the "stormwater management easement area" and shall
maintain and manage all landscaping and plantings thereon at all times in a
manner consistent with the plans and specifications approved by the city (and
upon request, furnish proof of compliance therewith). The owner grants to the
city and its designees the right of access upon, over and across the property
to inspect the stormwater management easement area and to perform any
maintenance of said areas (and to store equipment necessary therefor) which the
owner has failed to perform, if such failure continues for thirty (30) days
after written notice from the city of such failure. The city may enter upon the
property and perform such work as should have been undertaken by owner without
notice to owner in an emergency (e.g., where personal injury or material damage
to property may be imminent). The owner shall be liable for the cost of any
maintenance so performed by the city and shall promptly reimburse the city for
such costs, with interest at statutory prejudgment rate calculated from the
date of expenditure. Upon recordation by the city of a claim for reimbursement,
the city shall have a forecloseable lien upon the property to secure
reimbursement.
In addition to other remedies provided for above, upon owner's failure to
maintain the stormwater management easement areas (after notice where required
as aforesaid), the city shall be entitled to all remedies at law or equity to
enforce this agreement, including all remedies for the abatement of a nuisance,
which remedies shall be cumulative and not exclusive. If a judgment is entered
against the owner, the owner shall pay all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
of the city. The city shall not be liable to owner or any party claiming
through the owner for any damage caused by it in the performance of any
maintenance undertaken pursuant to this agreement, unless such damage is caused
by wanton or willful conduct. Failure to enforce a right granted hereunder
shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or any other rights hereunder. No
party shall be liable for failure to enforce the provisions hereof.
The owner reserves unto itself all rights not materially inconsistent with
these provisions, including the right to improve the property and to grant
easements and other rights and interests in and to said property.
The owners of any portion of the property shall be jointly and severally
responsible for the reimbursement of or payment to the city, as may be required
by the foregoing provisions. If title to all or any part of the property is
vested in a land trust, any beneficiaries thereof shall be personally liable
for all obligations imposed hereby on the "owner" of such property or portion
thereof so owned.
(Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-13-11: SITE RUNOFF STORAGE VARIANCE FEE PROGRAM:
   A.   Where a variance to the site runoff storage requirements of section 15-
72 of the Countywide Stormwater and Floodplain Ordinance, as now existing or
hereafter amended, is granted, payment into a Site Runoff Storage Variance Fee
Program shall be made prior to issuance of a stormwater management
certification as a condition of the variance. Payment of a site runoff storage
variance fee for the varied storage shall be made to the City and shall be
determined by applying the first applicable criterion as follows:
      1.   A fee calculated by multiplying the per acre-foot cost of the
closest off site storage facility times the varied storage where:
         a.   A design concept for the facility has been approved by the City
containing an estimate of the per acre-foot cost of constructing the storage,
including operation and maintenance costs; and
         b.   A formula has been developed to determine that any investment in
the facility shall be at least equal to the cost of planning, acquiring of
lands, constructing, operating, and maintaining the facility; and
      2.   One hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) per acre-foot of
detention volume.
   B.   Funds collected shall be accounted for in separate project or watershed
planning area accounts. Funds shall be used in the same community or watershed
planning areas as collected to enhance existing site runoff storage facilities
and related components, construct off site facilities and related components,
provide maintenance of stormwater facilities, or undertake other development
that provides a watershed benefit.
   C.   The City shall provide accounting on an annual basis of all funds
deposited in each project or watershed planning account and shall account for
each fund on a first in, first out basis.
   D.   Site runoff storage variance fees shall be refunded to the person who
paid the fee, or to that person's successor in interest, in accordance with
subsection E of this section, whenever the City fails to encumber the fees
collected within ten (10) years of the date on which such fees are collected.
   E.   Refunds shall be made provided that the appropriate party files a
petition with the City within one year from the date on which such fees are
required to be encumbered. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-13-12: PENALTY:
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be fined not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00), and every day on which a violation of this chapter shall occur shall
constitute a separate offense. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-13-13: POSTCONSTRUCTION BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (PCBMP) FEE IN LIEU
PROGRAM:
   A.   With the approval of the City, and provided the conditions of section
15-63 of the County ordinance apply, the applicant may be allowed or required
to pay PCBMP fee in lieu payment. Payment into a PCBMP fee in lieu program
shall be made prior to the issuance of a stormwater management certification.
   B.   PCBMP fee in lieu payment shall be made to the appropriate fee in lieu
program that identifies reasonable and rational cost to construct and maintain
similar PCBMPs for those areas of the development that remain without effective
water quality treatment.
   C.   If approved by the City, the payment rate due from an owner- developer
to the City for the payment of a fee in lieu of a PCBMP shall be five hundred

8-14-1: TITLE:
This chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the SIGN ORDINANCE OF THE
CITY OF WARRENVILLE. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-14-2: PURPOSE:
Much valuable information is conveyed by certain business signs of local retail
and service establishments, to the mutual benefit of both the business
establishment and the public. It is the intent of this chapter to encourage
such signs wherever they are moderate in size and design and consistent with
the public safety and the welfare of surrounding areas, but to discourage signs
which distract the attention of the motorists or are otherwise hazardous, or
which are inconsistent with the suburban character of Warrenville. (Ord. O2017-
38, 6-19-2017)
8-14-3: APPLICABILITY:
Except for freestanding interstate highway signs on public property which are
regulated under
title 7, chapter 6 of this Code, from and after the effective date of this
chapter, the use of all signs and portions of signs erected, altered, with
respect to height, area, and additions to sign face, and relocated in the City
shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Any existing sign
not in conformance with the regulations herein prescribed shall be regarded as
nonconforming.
The regulations of this chapter relate to the location of signs, by function
and type, within the zoning districts and shall be in addition to provisions of
the City Building and Electrical Codes applicable to the construction and
maintenance of signs. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-14-4: FILING REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES:
   A.   General: No sign shall hereafter be erected, altered, have its face
changed, or relocated until the sign conforms with the provisions of this
chapter and a permit has been obtained from the Community Development
Department if it is identified in table 8-14-4A, "Allowed And Prohibited Sign
Types - Permit Requirements In All Zoning Districts", of this section as a sign
type that requires a permit.
Routine maintenance or replacement of parts designed to be changed which do not
require any permit shall not be considered an alteration; provided such change
does not increase the surface area, height, or cause any other structural
change.
No sign permit will be issued for additional signs on property where an
existing sign has been illegally installed.
   B.   Allowed And Prohibited Sign Types; Permit Requirements In All Zoning
Districts: Table 8-14-4A of this section summarizes what sign types are allowed
and prohibited within the corporate limits of the City. This table also
identifies what specific zoning district(s) each permitted sign type is allowed
in, whether a permit is required and what section of this chapter should be
reviewed for additional restrictions and/or requirements. All permitted sign
types shall comply with the standards outlined in sections 
8-14-5 and
8-14-6 of this chapter. Prohibited sign standards are outlined in section 8-14-
7 of this chapter.

section
8-14-5 of this chapter apply to all signs. For definitions of each of the sign
types refer to section
 8-14-9 of this chapter.
   3.    Ground signs are allowed in all districts but only at nonresidential
establishments.
   4.    When incorporated into a ground sign for a nonresidential use.
   5.    Portable signs are prohibited except when advertising an approved

8-14-6B2a of this chapter.
   C.   Permit Process:
      1.   Application Requirements: Applications for sign permits shall be
filed with the Community Development Department upon forms provided by the City
and shall contain the following information:
         a.   Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
         b.   A plat of survey showing the location of the building, structure
or lot to which or upon which the sign is to be attached or erected, the
location of the sign in relation to buildings or structures on the lot and on
adjacent lots and rights-of-way.
         c.   Two (2) drawings of the sign showing method of construction,
illumination, if any, attachment to the building or ground support, and showing
the proposed sign face with the design and lettering to be placed thereon
accurately representing in scale as to size, area, proportion and color.
         d.   The name of the person, firm, corporation or association owning
and erecting the sign.
         e.   Such other information as the Zoning Administrator shall require
to show full compliance with this chapter and all other applicable laws and
ordinances of the City.
      2.   Review Process: It shall be the duty of the Zoning Administrator or
their representative, upon receipt of an application for a sign permit, to
examine plans, specifications, other data, and the premises upon which it is
proposed to erect the sign. If it shall appear that the proposed sign is in
compliance with all regulations applicable thereto, the Zoning Administrator or
their representative shall issue a permit.
      3.   Sign Permit Fees: As outlined in section
8-14-8 of this chapter.
      4.   Permit Revocation: If the work authorized under the sign permit is
not completed within six (6) months after the issuance of said permit, the
permit shall become null and void. All rights and privileges acquired under the
provisions of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, are mere licenses
subject to revocation at any time by the majority of the City Council in the
event of violation of any of the terms and conditions of this chapter. (Ord.
O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-14-5: GENERAL SIGN STANDARDS:
All signs hereafter constructed, erected, remodeled, relocated or expanded
shall comply with the following standards:
   A.   Sign Area/Copy/Face:
      1.   The term "sign area" shall be the gross surface area of each sign
face with a single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of a sign
and in no case passing through or between any adjacent elements of same. Such
perimeter shall not include any structural or framing elements lying outside
the limits of such sign and not forming an integral part of the display. For
computing the area of any wall sign which consists of letters mounted on a
wall, the area shall be deemed to be the area of the smallest rectangular
figure which can encompass all of the letters.
      2.   The term "sign copy" shall mean the physical sign message including
any words, letters, numbers, pictures, and symbols.
      3.   The term "sign face" shall mean the surface upon, against or through
which sign copy is displayed or illustrated, not including structural supports,
architectural features of a building or sign structure, nonstructural thematic
or decorative trim, or any areas that are separated from the background surface
upon which the sign copy is displayed by a distinct delineation, such as a
reveal or border.
         a.   In the case of panel or cabinet type signs, the sign face shall
include the entire area of each sign panel, cabinet or face substrate upon
which the sign copy is displayed or illustrated, excluding only the open space
between separate panels or cabinets.
         b.   In the case of signs painted on a building, or individual letters
or graphic elements affixed to a building or structure, the sign face shall
comprise the sum of the geometric figures or combination of regular geometric
figures drawn closest to the edge of the letters or separate graphic elements
comprising the sign copy, but not the open space between separate groupings of
sign copy on the same building or structure.
         c.   In the case of sign copy enclosed within a painted or illuminated
border, or displayed on a background contrasting in color with the color of the
building or structure, the sign face shall comprise the area within the
contrasting background, or within the painted or illuminated border.
   B.   Sign Height: The sign height shall be measured to the highest point of
the sign structure from the natural or approved finished grade level directly
below the sign or the centerline of the traveled way at a point perpendicular
to the location where the sign is to be placed, whichever is higher at the time
of sign installation. The intent of this subsection is to prevent permitted
ground sign height from being increased by installing a ground sign on a
manmade berm, landscape bed, or mound.
   C.   Setbacks: All signs, except as otherwise specifically permitted by the
provisions of this chapter, shall be set back not less than ten feet (10') from
any front, corner side, side and rear lot line, provided, however, that any
such sign shall not be located in the "vision clearance triangle" as defined in
this chapter, unless said sign is less than twenty four inches (24") in height.
   D.   Misrepresentation: No sign shall be permitted which contains knowingly
false information or knowingly misrepresents the product, service or commodity
to be offered, conducted or sold on the premises.
   E.   Traffic Safety: No sign shall be maintained at any location where by
reason of its position, size, shape or color it may obstruct, impair, obscure,
interfere with the view of or be confused with any traffic control sign, signal
or device, or where it may interfere with, mislead, confuse, or unsafely
obstruct the view of traffic.
   F.   Sign Area Limitation: The sign area of any sign shall not exceed a
maximum of two hundred (200) square feet per sign face.
   G.   Illumination:
      1.   Location/Design Of Light Source: Whenever an external artificial
light source is used to illuminate a sign, illumination shall be located,
shielded, and directed so as not to be directly visible from any public street
or residentially zoned property at grade level. All artificial illumination
shall be so designed, located, shielded, and directed as it illuminates only
the sign face and to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon adjacent
property or streets.
      2.   Level Of Illumination: In no event shall the illumination of any
sign, resulting from any internal or external artificial light source, exceed
fifty (50) foot-candles when measured with a standard light meter held
perpendicular to the sign face a distance equal to the narrowest dimension of
such sign face.
      3.   Signs Adjacent To Residential Areas: Any illuminated sign located on
a lot abutting or across the street from any residentially zoned property shall
not be illuminated between the hours of eleven o'clock (11:00) P.M. and seven
o'clock (7:00) A.M.; except such sign may remain illuminated during such time
as the activity to which the sign pertains is engaged.
      4.   Transitional Office District: Signs permitted in the Transitional
Office District shall be internally illuminated, backlit or downlit by an
incandescent, solar, light emitting diode (LED), or compact fluorescent light
(CFL) light source equivalent to not more than seventy five (75) watts per each
six (6) square feet of signage.
   H.   Maintenance: The owner of a sign and the owner of the premises on which
said sign is located shall be jointly and severally liable to maintain such
signs subject to the following standards:
      1.   Signs shall be maintained in a neat and orderly condition and good
working order, including illumination sources, at all times.
      2.   Signs shall be properly painted unless galvanized or otherwise
treated to prevent rust or deterioration.
      3.   Signs shall conform to maintenance provisions of the Building and
Electrical Codes as adopted by the City.
   I.   Cantera Sign Standards: The sign standards applicable within the
Cantera planned unit development area shall be those sign standards set forth
in the Cantera development control regulations. (Ord. O2017-38, 6-19-2017)
8-14-6: PERMITTED SIGNS:
   A.   Signs Allowed Without A Permit: The following permanent and temporary
signs are exempt from the permit requirements of this chapter:
      1.   Permanent Signs:
         a.   Memorial Signs And Tablets: Not to exceed twenty four (24) square
feet when displayed on public or private property.
         b.   Governmental Safety And Directional Signage: Permanent signs of a
duly constituted governmental body, including traffic or similar instructional
or regulatory signs relating to health, hazards, parking, swimming, dumping,
etc.

shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for
purposes of this chapter.
         b.   Termination By Change Of Business: Any nonconforming sign
advertising or relating to a business on the premises on which it is located
shall be terminated upon any change in the nature of the business; provided,

within thirty five (35) days of the ruling by the Zoning Administrator, by
filing with the Zoning Administrator a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds
thereof, and by filing said appeal and a copy of said notice of appeal with the
Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals all the
papers constituting the records upon which he made the decision from which
appeal has been taken. The notice of appeal and the appeal itself shall be
filed in such number of copies, be in such form and contain such information as
the Board may provide from time to time by general rule.
      2.   Action On Appeals: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the decision appealed unless the Zoning Administrator certifies
to the Zoning Board of Appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed with
him that, by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
proceedings shall not be stayed without a restraining order, which may be
granted by the City Council or by a court of record upon application following
notice to the Zoning Administrator, and upon due cause shown. The Board shall
select a reasonable time and place for the public hearing on the appeal, shall
give due notice thereof to the parties having a known interest therein and
shall render a written recommendation without unreasonable delay. Upon
conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make a recommendation to the City
Council with respect to the appeal. The City Council shall review the record
and the recommendation and shall make a final, binding decision with respect to
the appeal. The Council may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may
modify the decision from which the appeal was taken, and to that end the
Council shall have all the powers necessary to implement such decision.

post a notification sign in the front yard of the subject property stating the
type of appeal or variation requested, the scheduled date, time and location of
the hearing.

Board of Appeals, may authorize such variations as are hereinafter set forth
from the terms of this chapter in harmony with their purpose and intent as will
not be contrary to the public interest. Variations may be authorized only when

this section, that owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in practical
difficulties or particular hardship.
      2.   Application For Variation: An application for a variation shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator who shall forward a copy to the Secretary
of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The application shall contain the following
information as well as such additional information as may be prescribed by rule
of the Zoning Board:

proposed construction;
         b.   The characteristics of the subject property which prevent
compliance with the requirements of this chapter;
         c.   The extent of the variations which would be necessary to permit
the proposed construction; and
         d.   The practical difficulty or particular hardship which would
result if said particular requirements of the chapter were applied to the
proposed construction.
      3.   Proceedings Before The Zoning Board Of Appeals: Upon receipt of an
application in proper form, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall conduct a public
hearing thereon. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall examine the proposal for
variation in accordance with the following standards:
         a.   The proposed variation will not merely serve as a convenience to
the applicant, but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship which
will result if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out and which
is not generally applicable to signs within the district.
         b.   The alleged hardship has not been directly created by any person
having a proprietary interest in the premises.
         c.   The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood.
         d.   The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, increase the danger of fire or endanger the
public safety.
         e.   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of
the locality.
         f.   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent
of this chapter.
Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make a recommendation to the
City Council with respect to the variation, which recommendation shall include
preliminary findings of fact specifying the reasons for making the variation
and shall refer to any exhibits containing plans which have been made part of
the application or which were introduced at the public hearing as evidence.
Such exhibits shall remain part of the permanent record. The terms of relief
recommended shall be specifically set forth in conclusions or statements
separate from the findings of fact.
      4.   Action By The City Council: The City Council shall review the
record, the preliminary findings, and the recommendation and shall make a
final, binding decision with respect to the variation. The Council may accept
or reject, in whole or in part, or may modify the recommendation and findings
of the Board, and may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the
construction and design as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the
foregoing standards and to protect adjacent property and property values, and
to that end the Council shall have all the powers necessary to implement such
decision.

for the placard sign provisions identified in subsection

a notice of violation to the person(s) having control of, or acting as agent
for, such premises where the nuisance is located, or waiting for such person(s)
to abate or remove such nuisance as previously ordered by the Administrator.
      2.   In all other cases, the Administrator may notify, in writing, the
person(s) having control of, or acting as agent for, such premises where the

access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit
discharge. The City shall notify a violator of the proposed termination of its
MS4 access. The violator may petition the City for a reconsideration and
hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
City. In emergency situations, the City may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an

The obligation to register vacant buildings shall extend to mortgage lenders
that have obtained title to unoccupied buildings through a mortgage foreclosure
action. Mortgage lenders shall register unoccupied buildings with the Director
within fifteen (15) days of obtaining title to same.

owner shall maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the
building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy.
      2.   For buildings and/or premises which are determined by the Director

compliance with this chapter or, which will not, as reasonably determined by
the Director, achieve such compliance within three (3) months shall be
approved.
In the case of a vacant, unboarded building, the exterior of which is Code
compliant, no plan which fails to provide for compliance with this chapter or,
which will not, as reasonably determined by the Director, achieve such
compliance within two (2) years shall be approved; provided, however, the
Director may approve an extension of the time during which the building will be
unoccupied beyond two (2) years to a date certain, but then only based upon
clear and documented evidence of good cause shown by the owner, as determined
by the Director in the Director's reasonable discretion.

her consideration. All denial notices issued by the Director shall identify the
reason(s) the proposed vacant building plan is not consistent with the
following standards:

fees shall be paid by cashier’s check, certified check, money order or cash.

occupancy (if applicable) has been issued, any holder of a permit may apply to
the building official for a return of any unused portion of a cash bond or
other security deposit. The building official shall direct the City Finance
Director to refund to the holder of the permit any unused portion of the cash
bond or other security deposit, without interest. Provided, however, that, for

shall be deposited with the City Clerk. Bond requirements shall be according to
the schedule herewith or in such other amount as may be specified in writing by
the chief Code official.
Building bonds shall be as outlined in the City of Warrenville building permit
fee and building bond schedule as now existing or hereinafter amended and

   C.   Grading Guarantee Bond: If at the time a certificate of occupancy is
requested the final "as-built" grading survey or the final grading inspection
has not been approved by the City or if grass and/or sod has not been
established on the subject property, there shall be deposited with the City
cash or other security, which shall be known as the grading guarantee bond, in
the amount as hereinafter set forth:
 
Single-family residential additions and accessory structures  $ 300.00

This deposit shall be in addition to any project performance bond or letter of
credit previously established with regard to the property.
The purpose of this grading guarantee bond shall be to assure that a minimum of

built" grading survey has been submitted to and approved by the City for the
individual lot and the City has inspected and approved the final grading and
verified grass or sod has been established on the individual lot.
The City shall return the amount of the cash bond or release the amount of
security as soon as a final "as-built" grading survey has been submitted to and
approved by the City and the City has inspected and approved the final grading
and verified grass or sod has been established on the individual lot.
The amount of the grading guarantee bond shall be held or remain available for
the benefit of the City for a period of one year unless the City shall notify
the person depositing the grading guarantee bond of the specific defect
existing in the drainage of the lot.
In the event that the defect is not corrected, after reasonable notice the City
may utilize the funds to correct the defect. Provided, however, that the
utilization of this grading guarantee bond shall not prevent the City from
taking other action against the person responsible for the defect in drainage.
The grading guarantee bond shall not be released by the City until the entire
area immediately affected by the drainage characteristics of the individual lot
shall have also been found to comply with the ordinances of the City relating
to drainage.
The grading guarantee bond amounts set forth hereinabove or hereinafter amended
shall be incorporated into the City of Warrenville Building Fee and Bond
Schedule available at the City of Warrenville Community Development Department.

contractor or retain this fee from any monies on deposit to be refunded. (Ord.

occupants continue to cause the violations; or
   C.   An occupant or resident of the dwelling has refused entry to the
building owner, the building owner's agent, or the legal or beneficial owner of

the person was not the owner or lessee of the subject vehicle or vehicles
receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law violations on the date or
dates such violation notices were issued, or b) that the person already paid
the fines or penalties for the five (5) or more automated traffic law
violations indicated on the certified report. Such statement and supporting
documentation must be sent to the administrator by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or hand delivered to the administrator within five (5) days
after the person receives notice from the secretary that the person's driver's
license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the
secretary is presented with a notice from the city certifying that the fines or
penalties due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's
name on the certified report was in error. (Ord. 2742, 9-17-2012)

conformance with applicable approval procedures in this chapter and in Tables
2C and
2D.
B. APPROVAL PROCESS
1. APPLICATION FILING
Except in the case of a zoning action proposed by the City Council or a board
or commission of the City, any party requesting any City action to which this
section applies shall file an application on a form provided therefore by the
Zoning Administrator. Every such application shall include as a minimum the
applicable items provided in
Table 2A.

Except in the case of a Notice of Appeal, the Zoning Administrator may,
together with other departments, consultants, and officials of the City,
prepare a written review of the application. Such review shall be forwarded to
the Plan Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals, as applicable.
The staff may advise the applicant on meeting Ordinance requirements but shall,
unless specifically provided otherwise herein, have no power to approve or
disapprove any filing or in any way restrict the applicant's right to seek
formal approval thereof.
3. PUBLIC HEARING
Upon receipt of a complete and accurate application for a zoning action
requiring a public hearing under Tables

4. MANDATORY PUBLIC INFORMATION AND INPUT MEETINGS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL
PERMITTED USES IN THE RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
At least one mandatory public information and input meeting shall be conducted
for all new and expansions to existing non-residential permitted land uses
proposed in the residential zoning district that require Site Plan Approval.
Applicants/developers/ property owners are encouraged to participate in
additional meetings if major modifications are made to preliminary site plans
after they are presented at the initial mandatory public information and input
meeting.
   a.   Meeting Purpose: The purposes of mandatory public information and input
meetings are to (i) inform interested individuals about what type of non-
residential improvements are being proposed on a residentially zoned parcel of
property and (ii) solicit input and feedback on proposed site configuration and
related development design issues prior to the applicant/developer/property
owner committing large sums of time and money into the "final" design drawings
for a specific project. It is anticipated that the applicant/owner/developer
and City staff will use the input received at these meetings to assist in the
preparation and review of final design drawings for the proposed project.
   b.   Meeting Format: Unless otherwise directed by the Community Development
Director, these meetings shall be conducted in the Warrenville City Hall in
conjunction with a regularly scheduled Plan Commission meeting. Mandatory
public information and input meetings shall begin with the applicant/owner/
developer providing a brief presentation and overview of the proposed project
for the public. Immediately following the overview presentation, the applicant/
owner/developer, their specialty design consultants, and appropriate City staff
members will participate in an informal "open house" meeting to provide
additional information, answer specific questions, and receive additional input
on the proposed project. The "open house" component of this process will
generally occur immediately in advance of the more formal portion of a regular
Plan Commission meeting. A formal input form will be provided so that meeting
attendees may submit formal written comments, questions or concerns. The
applicant/owner/developer is expected to also make a brief presentation of the
project to and solicit feedback on proposed project from the Warrenville Plan
Commission.
   c.   Meeting Notice Requirements: The applicant/owner/developer shall notify
the public of the meeting by posting a public notice sign in compliance with
the requirements listed in Section
2.E.1. of this ordinance. The applicant/owner/ developer shall include a
laminated version of the proposed preliminary site plan on the required public
notice sign. The City will endeavor to prepare and distribute a press release
identifying the time, date, and purpose of the meeting to newspapers of local
distribution.
   d.   Meeting Application Requirements: All mandatory public information and
input meeting applications shall comply with the requirements of Tables
2A and
2B. (Ord. 2276, 4-18-06)
5. PLAN COMMISSION OR ZBA ACTION
The Plan Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend to the petitioner
revisions in the petition that would make it more acceptable. The petitioner
may, at his or her discretion, submit a revised petition to the Commission at a
continuation of the meeting or hearing without paying an additional filing fee.
This provision shall not, however, affect the right of the petitioner to have
the original petition without revisions acted upon by the Board, Commission, or
City Council.
Within any time limit specified in Tables
2C and
2D, the Plan Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals shall prepare a report
consisting of written findings of fact pertaining to the Approval Criteria
provided herein for the applicable zoning action together with an action on the
application, passed by a majority vote of its members, and any conditions or
restrictions to which the action is to be subject. The report shall include the
roll call vote on the action.
Except as otherwise provided in Tables
2C and
2D, the action taken by the Commission or Board shall be in the form of a
recommendation for final action by the City Council.
In the case of an application for a variance or a Planned Unit Development, the
action may include any modification of normal requirements that is authorized
by this Ordinance.
6. CITY COUNCIL ACTION
The Plan Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit to the City
Council its recommendation within the time limit specified in Tables
2C and
2D. The City Council shall not act upon any application requiring a Commission
or Board recommendation until either it has received such recommendation or
until such time limit has passed.
The Council shall not approve any application unless it finds that the zoning
action applied for meets applicable Approval Criteria provided herein. An
extraordinary majority vote of all members of the City Council shall be
required to approve an application if so provided in Tables
2C and
2D.
Except in the case of an amendment, the Council may make its approval subject
to any conditions or restrictions it finds necessary to assure compatibility
with the vicinity of the subject property. The Council may also set time limits
within which such conditions or restrictions must be complied with or financial
guarantees to ensure compliance.
7. ISSUANCE OF PERMIT OR CERTIFICATE
The Zoning Administrator shall issue a Special Use Permit or other permit or
certificate given final approval by the Zoning Board of Appeals, Plan
Commission, or City Council within 5 business days after approval thereof
unless the approving body directs otherwise. The permit or certificate shall
specify any conditions or restrictions to which such body has made its approval
subject. The Zoning Administrator shall advise the applicant in writing of any
denial by such body and the reasons, therefore within 5 business days of the
decision.
8. REVOCATION OR INVALIDATION

hereunder:
      (1)   if the action taken after the permit or certificate is issued is
not consistent with plans and information submitted in support of the
application therefore; or
      (2)   if any applicable provisions of this Ordinance or any conditions or
restrictions imposed in connection with approval of the permit or certificate
are not complied with; or
      (3)   if after they are initially complied with, compliance with such
conditions or restrictions is not maintained at any time.
   b.   The Zoning Administrator shall give the permittee or Certificate holder
15 business days notice of any intended revocation and the reasons therefore
and an opportunity within that period to answer any charges of noncompliance or
to propose measures to bring the permitted action into compliance within a
reasonable time.
   c.   In addition, any variance, Special Use, or Site Plan shall
automatically become invalid: (Ord. 2346, 12-15-06)
      (1)   if the use for which it was approved has not been established nor a
Building Permit issued and construction thereof begun within one year of such
approval; or
      (2)   if the use for which it was approved has not been utilized or has
been abandoned for a continuous period of one year or more; or
      (3)   in the case of a Preliminary Plan approval for a Planned Unit
Development Special Use, if a Final Plan or a revised Preliminary Plan is not
filed within one year of approval of the Preliminary Plan, unless the Planned
Unit Development is in the SD District; or
      (4)   in the case of a Planned Unit Development in the SD District, (i) a
Preliminary Plan shall become invalid if a Final Plan or a revised Preliminary
Plan is not approved within seven years of approval of the Preliminary Plan, or
(ii) a Final Plan shall become invalid if a building permit has not been issued
and construction thereof begun within two years of approval of the Final Plan.
The City Council may approve an extension of any time period specified herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the use area identified in an SD District
Preliminary or Final Plan shall survive the expiration of the preliminary or
final plan and the use area so identified shall continue to remain in full
force and effect unless otherwise amended as provided in Section
8.F.4.
9. RESUBMISSION
Except as otherwise provided herein, no application that has been denied shall
be resubmitted within one year of the date of denial except on the grounds of
new factual evidence or a change in conditions found to be valid by the Plan
Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals, whichever has initial jurisdiction over
the application.
C. FILING FEES AND RECOVERABLE COSTS
   1.   Application Fee established: All applications shall be accompanied by
the applicable, non-refundable Filing Fee in the amount set forth in the annual
fee ordinance.
   2.   Recoverable Development Costs:
      a.   Recovery Of Certain Costs Established: Every application filed and
processed pursuant to this zoning ordinance that requires the city to incur
costs associated with review and approval of the application is subject to the
application and, if different, the applicant, are jointly and severally liable
for the payment of recoverable costs. By filing an application, the owner and
applicant are deemed to have agreed to pay the recoverable costs; provided,
however, that the city may require the owner and applicant to enter into an
escrow agreement affirming their responsibility for the payment of the
recoverable costs.
      The recovery of city costs pursuant to this subsection 2.C.2 are, in
addition to all other filing fees and other charges established by the city, as
set forth in this code and the annual fee ordinance.
      b.   Recoverable Costs: The following costs incurred by the city in
processing an application are recoverable costs for the purpose of this
subsection 2.C.2:
         i.   Professional and technical consultant fees, including, without
limitation, fees for engineering and plan, landscape, and traffic consultant
services that the city determines necessary to review the application;
         ii.   The fees and costs of a hearing officer, if any; and
         iii.   Legal fees, including, without limitation, the city attorney
and any additional city-retained attorney or law firm (costs to be measured by
their time expended and multiplied by their hourly rate of pay) incurred for
services rendered related to the application, including, without limitation,
consultation, meeting attendance, and document review, negotiation, and
preparation.
      c.   Payment Of Recoverable Costs And Recoverable Cost Escrow:
         i.   Escrow Required: Upon filing an application, the applicant must
deposit a cash escrow with the city in an amount to be determined necessary by
the community and economic development director to cover the anticipated
recoverable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and processing the
application. Interest is not payable on the escrow.
         ii.   Charges Against Escrow: From the date of filing of an
application, the city will maintain an accurate record of the recoverable costs
incurred in the processing of the application. The city may, from time to time,
draw funds from the escrow account established for the application to pay the
recoverable costs and may transfer such funds to the appropriate city accounts.
The city will notify the owner and applicant and maintain an accurate record of
all such drawings.
         iii.   Additional Escrow Deposits: Should the community and economic
development director at any time determine that the escrow account established
for the application is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay the
recoverable costs, the community and economic development director will inform
the applicant and require an additional deposit in an amount deemed sufficient
to cover foreseeable additional recoverable costs. The community and economic
development director may direct that processing of the application be suspended
or terminated until the additional amount is deposited into the escrow.
         iv.   Final Settlement: As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the city will prepare a final accounting of the
escrow account in connection with the application and of the actual recoverable
costs related to the application and will make a final charge for the actual
recoverable costs remaining to be paid. Any remaining funds in the escrow
account after the final payment will be returned to the owner or applicant, as
applicable. A copy of the final accounting will be provided to the owner and
applicant.
         v.   Insufficient Amount For Final Settlement: If the amount in the
escrow account is insufficient to pay the total actual recoverable costs, a
written demand for payment of the balance due will be mailed to the owner and
applicant.
   3.   Condition Of All Applications, Approvals, And Permits: No application
filed pursuant to this zoning ordinance will be considered complete unless and
until all costs and fees, filing fees and deposits due pursuant to this section
2.C have been paid. Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to
the zoning ordinance is, whether or not expressly so conditioned, deemed to be
conditioned upon payment of recoverable costs and fees as required by this
section.
   4.   Tolling Time Periods: Where this zoning ordinance provides that the
passage of time without decision or action will be deemed an approval or a
recommendation for approval, time periods will be tolled during any period of
nonpayment of the recoverable costs and fees and deposits due pursuant ot this
section.
   5.   Failure To Pay Recoverable Costs And Fees: Failure to fully pay any
incurred recoverable cost, fees, or escrow deposit may requested or denying or
revoking any relief sought or issued to the subject property or development.

Footnotes to Table 4A
(a)   For Single-Family detached dwellings on newly created lots not served by
public sewers, minimum lot area and width shall be 40,000 sf and 140 feet,
respectively.
(b)   Minimum lot area for townhouse, single-family attached, and multi-family
developments shall in no case be less than 40,000 sf.
(c)   Except single-family detached dwellings in R-6, which shall have 6,000 sf
if served by public sewer and 40,000 sf otherwise.
(d)   All principal uses in R-6 except single-family detached dwellings shall
be served by public sewer.
(e)   Except for the following uses in R-6:
 
Two-Family                               80 feet
Single-Family Detached with Public Sewer 50 feet
 
(f)   Or 10% of the width of the lot, whichever is less.
(g)   Minimum interior side yard width in R-6 shall be:
 
Single-Family Detached              5 feet
Single-Family Attached & Townhouses 10 feet
Two-Family                          10 feet
Multi-Family                        25 feet
Side yard requirements for attached dwelling units on separate lots shall not
apply where the unit is attached to another unit at the side lot line.
 
(h)   Unless otherwise approved by Planned Unit Development, the lot coverage
in residential districts shall be as follows:
 
Lot Size                       Max Lot Coverage, whichever is greater
>= 30,000 sf.                  28% or 9,599 sq. feet
>= 14,000 sf. and < 30,000 sf. 32% or 5,039 sq. ft.
>= 10,000 sf. and < 14,000 sf. 36% or 3,999 sq. ft.
>= 7,000 sf. and < 10,000 sf.  40% or 3,080 sq. ft.
< 7,000 sf.                    44% without limitation on the number of square
                               feet
 
   Lot coverage includes principal structures, driveways, and accessory
structures, including, without limitation, patios, pools and accessory
buildings including, without limitation, garages; provided, however, that
pervious pavers, green roofs, and fences shall be excluded from the lot
coverage calculations. For the purposes of this footnote (h), the following
definitions shall apply:
      “Pervious pavers” means pervious concrete, porous asphalt, permeable
pavers or other forms of pervious or porous paving material intended to allow
passage of water through the pavement section. It includes an aggregate base
that provides structural support and acts as a stormwater reservoir.
      “Green roof” means an engineered roofing system that allows for the
propagation of rooftop vegetation and the retention of stormwater while
maintaining the integrity of the underlying roof structure and membrane.”
   Whenever the lot coverage would have exceeded the maximum allowable lot
coverage but for the exclusion of pervious pavers or green roofs, the property
owner must execute and record, at its sole expense, a permeable improvement
maintenance agreement and covenant, in the form periodically approved by the
City council. The permeable improvement maintenance agreement and covenant must
run with the land, bind future owners of the property, require the permeable
improvement to be maintained in a first-rate manner, and prohibit the pervious
pavers or green roof from being converted to impervious pavers or non-green
roof without first obtaining a permit for such conversion from the city.
(i)   Height Bonus: An increase of both minimum required side yard setbacks (or
both a side yard and a corner side yard setback on corner lots) of one foot
(1') more than the setback required under
Table 4A, excluding footnote (f), allows six inches (6'') more of building
height up to the maximum height as specified in
Table 4A.
(j)   Reserve/Flag lots, enabling access to interior areas of a parcel from a
dedicated street only, may be permitted in accordance with the following:
      1.   All lots shall be a minimum of 40,000 sf, exclusive of the portion
of the lot used as the reserve strip;
      2.   That each reserve strip providing access to a lot shall be not less
than 20 feet in width;
      3.   That not more than three lots consisting of two reserve lots with
reserve strips, each 20 feet in width, and one key lot with a frontage of not
less than 125 feet wide along the dedicated street shall be permitted;
      4.   That all reserve lots shall be subdivided in accordance with the
Subdivision Regulations; and
      5.   That where more than one reserve lot is created, the reserve strips,
i.e., 40 foot access to interior lots, shall be dedicated and marked as private
easement or access to interior lots, with only one permitted entrance to the
dedicated street for both reserve lots.
(k)   Subject to the provisions governing Special Uses in the Special
Development Approvals section.
(l)   If a corner lot, in an R-5 residence district cannot meet the
requirements of
Table 4A corner side yard of not less than fifteen (15) feet, maintaining an
interior side yard of five (5) feet and a building width of no more than thirty
(30) feet is allowed.
(m)   The building façade facing the Front Property Line shall contain a window
(s) and/or egress doors containing a total rough opening area not less than 16
square feet.
(n)   Minimum lot width of corner lots in the R-3, R-4, R-5 and R-6 Districts
shall be increased by 20% from the minimum dimensions outlined herein. The
increase shall be required for any subdivision or re-subdivision resulting in
the creation of a corner lot after September 1, 1995.
(o)   Reserved For Future Use.
(p)   Except as otherwise provided in footnote (q), in any single family
residential district where 50 percent or more of the frontage of a block has
been developed with buildings, the minimum front or corner side yard shall be
the lesser of the mean average of the existing actual front and corner side
yards on the block or the underlying front and corner side yard setback
regulations found in Table 4A: Residential District Requirements where the new
building is proposed. In computing the “mean average of the existing actual
front and corner side yards on the block,” the following regulations shall
apply:
1.   Flag lots shall be excluded from the frontage of the block measurement and
from the mean average calculation.
2.   Homes on double frontage and through lots shall only be included in the
mean average calculation when the front façade of the home is oriented towards
the block frontage on which the mean average calculation is being performed.
3.   Frontage of the block measurement and mean average calculation on cul-de-
sac streets shall not include vacant lots where more than 50 percent of the lot
width is located on the cul-de-sac bulb or developed lots with a driveway that
connects to the cul-de-sac bulb.
(q)   The provisions of footnote [p] shall not apply in the following
situations:
   1.   Subdivisions approved as a Planned Unit Development unless specifically
stated in the approved PUD ordinance; or
   2.   Lots located in a new subdivision recorded after the effective date
(Ordinance No. O2017-54 effective August 21, 2017) of this footnote when the
entire block on which said lots are located were created by the new
subdivision; or
   3.   Existing homes proposed for reconstruction or expansion/addition shall
be allowed, subject to the provisions of the Nonconformities Chapter, to be
reconstructed or added onto at their current setback or the minimum front/
corner side yard setback established in the underlying zoning district,
whichever is greater.
(r)   See Section
10.A.3.D of the Zoning Ordinance for building height regulations regarding
solar energy systems.

5. OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
A. PROVISIONS APPLYING TO PARKING AND LOADING
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of the requirements in this chapter is to further the appropriate
provision and design of off-street parking and loading areas that will:
   1.   provide access for occupants, employees, customers, clients, and
visitors to land uses in a community dependent on automobile and truck
transportation
   2.   foster safe and efficient circulation of vehicles and pedestrians both
on private property and on adjacent public streets
   3.   minimize nuisance in residential areas from on- or off-street parking
of large numbers of, or incompatible types of, vehicles.
2. APPLICABILITY
Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided in conformance with the
requirements of Tables
5A,
5B,
5C,
5D, and
5E and other provisions herein for:
   1.   all new uses, and
   2.   all existing uses that are changed so that they are:
      a.   enlarged or expanded, or
      b.   otherwise changed in density, intensity, capacity, or other measure
that determines parking or loading requirements hereunder, or
      c.   converted to any other use to which different parking requirements
herein apply.
Except that any lawful use existing on the day of effect of this Ordinance, or
of any applicable amendment thereto that increases the number of parking or
loading spaces required for such use, shall be required to add only the number
of spaces equivalent to the difference between the requirements of the
Ordinance or amendment for the use after the change and for the use before the
change.
The requirements of this chapter apply to any provision, removal, enlargement,
or alteration of any off-street parking or loading spaces or areas that are
accessory to any building or structure and either:
   1.   are existing as of the effective date of these regulations, or
   2.   are new spaces or areas required to be provided hereunder or
voluntarily provided in excess of the requirements herein.
These provisions shall likewise apply to parking that is the Principal Use of a
parcel. Open sales lots for motor vehicles shall not be considered as parking
spaces for purposes of this chapter.
No additional spaces shall be required for expansion or change of an existing
use if the standards herein would require an increase over the spaces already
provided on the site of less than 15 percent.
3. PREREQUISITE FOR PERMITS
1.   Building Permit/Zoning Certificate
Prior to issuance of a Building Permit, Zoning Certificate, or Special Use
Permit, the Zoning Administrator shall determine that the application therefor
exhibits compliance with:
   1.   all applicable provisions of these and other City regulations from
which a variance has not been approved as provided therein, and
   2.   all conditions to which any approval thereunder has been made subject.
2.   Certificate of Occupancy
Either prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or within such period of
time thereafter as the Plan Commission may have approved, he or she shall
likewise determine either:
   1.   that parking and loading facilities required herein have been fully
installed and improved in conformance with:
      a.   all currently applicable approved applications for City permits,
certificates, or approvals, and
      b.   any conditions to which approval thereof was made subject, and
      c.   all provisions of this and other applicable City ordinances from
which a variance has not been approved, or
   2.   that financial sureties approved by the City Attorney have been
provided guaranteeing such installation and improvement.
4. VARIANCES; ADMINISTRATIVE REDUCTIONS
   1.   The City Council may approve a variance to the parking or loading
requirements herein on the basis either:
      a.   of criteria provided in the general regulations governing variances
in this Ordinance, or
      b.   of submission of parking demand studies, documented industry
standards, or other evidence satisfactory to the Board that the nature of the
use requires fewer spaces than required herein.
      Procedures for approval of parking variances shall otherwise be the same
as provided in this Ordinance for all variance approvals.
   2.   The Community Development Director may reduce the number of off-street
parking spaces for residential and commercial uses required by Table 5D and
Table 5E of this Code by up to 20 percent if the reduction is justified by any

B. OFF-STREET PARKING PROVISIONS
1. COLLECTIVE PROVISION
Required parking spaces for different uses may be provided collectively. Except
as provided herein under Parking for Shopping Centers and Shared Parking, the
total number of spaces so provided shall not be less than the sum of the spaces
required for each separate use, and no parking space shall serve as the
required space for more than one use.
A binding written agreement approved as legally sufficient by the City Attorney
shall be filed with an application for a Building Permit guaranteeing the
intended users of collective parking spaces the right to their use.
2. PARKING FOR SHOPPING CENTERS
The number of parking spaces required for retail and personal service uses
located in a shopping center shall be as provided for shopping centers in
Table 5E rather than the sum of the spaces required for the individual uses.
Except that the number of spaces for restaurants, taverns, and drive-in
facilities located in a shopping center, and for any establishment occupying
over 50 percent of the net floor area of the center, shall be as provided in
Table 5E for these individual uses. This number shall be added to the number of
spaces required by
Table 5E for shopping centers for the balance of the uses in the center.
3. MARKING
All off-street parking spaces for uses required to provide over 15 spaces shall
be marked by durable painted lines, curbs, or other means that clearly
designate individual spaces. (Ord. 2023-28, 8-7-2023)
4. SHARED PARKING
Off-street parking spaces provided in a public or commercial parking lot
located within 500 feet of a house of worship may be credited by the Zoning
Administrator toward the spaces required herein for the house of worship up to
a maximum of 50 percent of the total spaces required.
To be credited, such spaces shall be included in a written agreement filed with
the Zoning Administrator and approved as legally sufficient by the City
Attorney that specifically allows the use of such spaces by the house of
worship.
5. PHASED INSTALLATION OF REQUIRED PARKING FACILITIES
Upon presentation of clear and convincing evidence by the applicant that the
total number of required parking spaces are not immediately necessary for the
current use of a building or structure, the Plan Commission may recommend and
the City Council may permit the phased/future installation of up to 25% of the
total number of required parking spaces. Sufficient area shall be reserved on
the site for the construction of the future parking facilities and related
required landscaping and stormwater management improvements in accordance with
all applicable City requirements.
The future parking facilities shall be installed when the City Council passes a
motion and requires their installation.
If phased installation of required parking facilities is approved, the
applicant shall enter into an agreement, in a form acceptable to the City,
setting forth the terms and conditions applicable to the phased installation of
the parking facilities. The agreement shall run with the land and shall be
recorded with the DuPage County Recorders Office at the applicant's sole cost
and expense. The agreement shall further provide that, in the event that the
applicant fails to comply with any term or condition thereof, the City shall
have the following legal remedies, none of which shall be exclusive:
   (1)   the right to sue for breach of contact, whether in law or in equity,
for damages, specific performance, or any other legal remedy deemed appropriate
by the City;
   (2)   the right to revoke the certificate of occupancy for the premises;
   (3)   the right to enter upon the property to install the required parking
spaces at the owner's sole cost and expense and to lien the premises in order
to enforce payment to the City for the work performed; and
   (4)   the right to recover the City Attorney's fees and court costs in any
enforcement action.
(Ord. 2276, 4-18-06)
6. WHEEL GUARDS OR CURBING
Where parking spaces are so located that vehicles parked therein might extend
beyond the parking surface, such as onto streets, sidewalks, or landscaped
areas, there shall be installed wheel guards, bumper guards, curbing, or other
means of restraint to prevent such encroachment. This requirement shall not
apply to uses providing 15 or fewer parking spaces. (Ord. 2023-28, 8-7-2023)
7. FORWARD VEHICULAR MOTION
Except for dwellings having individual garages or driveways, off-street parking
areas shall be designed to enable vehicles to enter or leave such areas moving
in a forward direction.
8. LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES
a.   On Same Or Separate Lot
Required off-street parking for all residential uses shall be provided on the
same lot as the use served. Parking spaces within garages or carports and on
driveways shall be counted as required spaces for such dwellings and
Transitional Office zoned uses. Stacked parking spaces (i.e., a second parking
space located directly behind the first driveway parking space) shall not be
counted as required spaces for such dwellings, but may be counted (up to a
maximum of 2 spaces deep) as required spaces for Transitional Office zoned
uses.
Required parking for other uses may also be provided on a separate lot that is
in the same possession by deed, lease, or other written certification approved
as legally sufficient by the City Attorney that confirms its availability to
the use.

6. NONCONFORMITIES
A. PURPOSE
The intent of this chapter is to provide for the continuation and, under
appropriate circumstances, elimination of existing uses of property that do not
conform to the requirements of this Ordinance or that may not conform to future
amendments thereto.
The provisions herein are designed to accomplish this intent in a way that:
   1.   Recognizes the rights and interests of owners of individual properties
that have been rendered nonconforming by City action to upgrade zoning policies
and standards;
   2.   Allows the property owner or lessee to recover his or her investment in
the Nonconformity, while also recognizing that by virtue of the Nonconformity
he or she enjoys a right not generally available to other property owners in
the same district; and
   3.   Minimizes the nuisance, reduction in neighboring property values, and
other adverse effects of properties that do not conform to their environs.
B. TYPES OF NONCONFORMITIES
A Nonconformity is any characteristic of a structure or lot or parcel of land,
or of the use thereof, which was lawful prior to the date of enactment of this
Ordinance or any amendment thereto but that does not currently conform to the
requirements thereof.
The lawful issuance of a Building Permit prior to the dates specified above
shall be considered to establish the lawful nonconforming status of any
building or structure.
There are three categories of Nonconformities:
   1. Use Nonconformities
   Use Nonconformities are any activities or functions carried on at a premises
(as either a Principal or Accessory Use) that are not allowed by the Permitted
and Conditional Uses of the zoning district in which the premises is situated,
irrespective of the use for which the premises may have been designed.
   2. Design Nonconformities
   A Design Nonconformity is the design or intended use of all or substantially
all of a premises for any Principal or Accessory Use not allowed by the
Permitted and Conditional Uses of the zoning district in which it is located,
irrespective of the nature of the use or activity currently carried on at that
premises.
   3. Standards Nonconformities
   Standards Nonconformities are all other Nonconformities with the
requirements of this Ordinance, usually involving failure to conform to the
quantitative development standards established herein.
C. ELIMINATION OF NONCONFORMITIES
Properties with Nonconformities shall be lawful uses hereunder and may continue
unchanged without time limitation, but changes thereto shall be subject to the
provisions of
Table 6A.
D. VACANT ADJACENT NONRESIDENTIAL LOTS
Two or more adjacent lots shall be considered as a single lot for zoning
purposes if:
1.   All of the lots are in the same ownership, and
2.   All of the lots are vacant, and
3.   One or more of the lots is a legal nonconforming lot of record, and
4.   All of the lots are in the same non-residential district, and
5.   At least one of the other lots abuts a nonconforming lot along a side lot
line, or, in the case of a corner lot, along a side or rear lot line.
No division, sale, or use shall be made of any portion of such zoning lot
except in conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance and with any
approved variance therefrom.
E. ADMINISTRATION
A Certificate of Occupancy shall be required for the continuation of all
Nonconformities created by this Ordinance or any amendment thereto.
When the Zoning Administrator determines that a property has any Nonconformity,
he or she shall notify the owner or lessee thereof of such Nonconformity and of
the applicable regulations.
Such notice shall require that the recipient file with the Zoning
Administrator, within 90 days of the date thereof, either satisfactory evidence
that the property is not nonconforming or a completed application for a
Certificate of Occupancy to continue the Nonconformity.
Upon timely receipt of a complete and accurate application therefor, the Zoning
Administrator shall issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the nonconforming
property.
The Zoning Administrator shall maintain a file of all Nonconformities of which
he or she has sent notice and of all Nonconformities issued Certificates of
Occupancy.

abutting lot in different ownership.
[a]:   These Nonconformities shall be completely eliminated on properties
having the type of Nonconformity specified when the specified change to the

O2023-21, 5-15-23)
7. SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS
A. VARIANCES
1. PURPOSE
Because of special characteristics of particular properties in the City, the
literal application of the provisions of this Ordinance may in certain
instances create hardships or practical difficulties not intended by these
regulations. The Zoning Board of Appeals may accordingly recommend, and the
City Council may grant, variances from the literal application of the
provisions of this Ordinance based on findings of fact as provided in this
chapter. Variances herein shall be considered the same as variations under the
Illinois Revised Statutes.
2. APPROVAL PROCESS
Variances shall be approved only in conformance with the Approval Process
provided in the Filing Procedures section of this Ordinance and the Approval
Criteria in
Table 7A.
3. EXISTING VARIANCES
Any lawful variance previously granted to any lawful use existing on the date
of adoption of this Ordinance or any amendment thereto that requires a variance
under such Ordinance or amendment, shall be considered a lawful variance
without the need for approval of a variance hereunder. Variances shall be
transferable and shall run with the land.
Table 7A: Approval Criteria for Variances
In recommending or granting approval or conditional approval of a variance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals and the City Council shall prepare written findings of
fact that all of the conditions below apply to the application:
1. Special Circumstances
Special circumstances exist relating to the physical character of the property
that are peculiar to the property and that do not apply generally to other
properties in the same zoning district. And these circumstances are not of so
general or recurrent a nature as to make it practical to provide, in the form
of an amendment to this Ordinance, a general rule to cover them.
2. Hardship or Practical Difficulties
Because of these special circumstances, the literal application of the
provisions of this Ordinance would, without a variance, result in unnecessary
and undue hardship or practical difficulties for the applicant, as
distinguished from mere inconvenience.
3. Not Resulting from Applicant Action
The special circumstances, practical difficulties, or hardship that are the
basis for the variance have not resulted from any act, undertaken subsequent to
the adoption of this Ordinance or any applicable amendment thereto, of any
party with a present interest in the property.
4. Reasonable Use and Return
Without the requested variance, the property cannot yield a reasonable return,
or cannot be reasonably used consistent with the intent of the zoning district
and the use of other properties therein, but the purpose of the variance is not
otherwise to increase the return from the property or to confer special
privileges not ordinarily enjoyed by other properties in the same district.
5. Not Alter Local Character
The variance will not alter the essential character of the locality or
substantially impair public safety or welfare or property values in the area.
6. Minimum Variance Needed
The variance approved is the minimum required to allow reasonable use and
enjoyment of the property.
B. AMENDMENTS AND REZONINGS
1. PURPOSE
To adapt to changing development conditions and provide for the phased
implementation of the City Comprehensive Plan, the Plan Commission may from
time to time recommend, and the City Council may adopt, amendments to the
provisions of the text of this Ordinance, or the Zoning District Map, as
provided by the Illinois Revised Statutes.
2. APPROVAL PROCESS
Amendments shall be approved in conformance with the Approval Process provided
in the Filing Procedures section of this Ordinance. Map amendments shall be
approved only in conformance with applicable Approval Criteria in
Table 7B.
Table 7B: Approval Criteria for Zoning Map Amendments (Rezonings)
In recommending approval or conditional approval of a map amendment (rezoning),
the Plan Commission shall transmit to the City Council written findings of fact
that all of the conditions below apply to the application. In granting approval
or conditional approval, the City Council shall similarly find that all of the
following conditions apply:
   1. Compatible With Use or Zoning of Environs
   The proposed use(s) or the uses permitted under the proposed zoning
classification are compatible with existing uses or existing zoning of property
in the environs.
   2. Supported by Trend of Development
   The trend of development in the general area since the original zoning of
the affected property was established supports the proposed use of zoning
classification.
   3. Consistent With Comprehensive Plan Objectives
   The proposed use or zoning classification is in harmony with the objectives
of the Comprehensive Plan of the City as viewed in light of any changed
conditions since its adoption.
   4. Furthers Public Interest
   The proposed use or zoning classification promotes the public interest and
not solely the interest of the applicant.
C. SPECIAL USES
1. PURPOSE
Certain uses cannot be allowable generally in a particular zoning district, or
in any zoning district, because of the impact their special character creates
on surrounding areas.
Some such uses may, however, be allowed under special conditions. These uses
are provided for in this Ordinance as Special Uses.
Because a Special Use is compatible with the applicable zoning district only
under special conditions, a Special Use Permit is required before any use
authorized herein as a Special Use may be established.
Except as specifically provided herein, all regulations of the applicable
zoning district, and all other applicable regulations of this and other City
ordinances, shall apply to Special Uses.
2. APPROVAL PROCESS
Special Uses shall be approved by the Plan Commission only in conformance with
the Approval Process provided in the Filing Procedures section of this
Ordinance, the applicable Approval Criteria in
Table 7C, and other applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
3. EXISTING USES
Any lawful use existing on the date of adoption of this Ordinance or any
amendment thereto that requires Special Use approval under such Ordinance or
amendment, shall be considered a lawful Special Use without the need for
approval of a Special Use Permit hereunder whether or not a Special Use Permit
was ever issued prior to such date. It shall be the responsibility of the user
of the property to provide evidence of the existence of the use on or prior to
such date.
Any change in the operation of a use that does not conform with conditions
attached to a previous and applicable Special Use Permit Approval and all
changes from the Approved Special Use Permit involving an increase in the
occupant capacity of a structure, in the building footprint, the volume of the
structure, or in the area of parking lot pavement on the site subsequent to
such Approval date shall require the approval of a new Special Use Permit.
(Ord. 2276, 4-18-06)
4. REVIEW OF SPECIAL USES
In evaluating the suitability of a proposed Special Use, the Plan Commission
and City Council shall examine the following characteristics of the proposed
use and its individual structures or components:
   a.   Location and orientation
   b.   Lot size
   c.   Size of facility, including floor area, structure height, design
capacity, and anticipated employment.
   d.   Site design and arrangement
   e.   Provisions affecting on- and off-site pedestrian and traffic movement,
vehicle storage, and the passage of emergency vehicles
   f.   Appearance
   g.   Screening or landscaping
   h.   On- or off-site buffering from incompatible uses with open spaces or
transitional uses
   i.   Operations factors, such as hours of use or environmental controls
   j.   Other characteristics of the proposed use pertinent in the judgment of
the Commission or Council to an assessment of the impact of the use on the area
The Commission may recommend, and the Council may require, such conditions
relating to any of the above characteristics as it may judge necessary to allow
the use to conform to the Approval Criteria in Table 7C.
The Commission or Council may call upon technical experts or have studies
performed to determine specific development standards or conditions for any
particular Special Use.
5. EXPANSION OR ALTERATION
A new Special Use Permit shall be required for any existing Special Use that
expands its operations in conflict with conditions attached to an existing
valid Special Use Permit approval, and/or increases (i) the occupant capacity
of the structure, (ii) the building footprint of the structure, (iii) the
volume of the structure, or (iv) the area of parking lot pavement on the site.
(Ord. 2276, 4-18-06)
Table 7C: Approval Criteria for Special Uses
In recommending or granting approval or conditional approval of a Special Use,
the City Council and Plan Commission shall prepare written findings of fact
that on the basis of the characteristics cited under Review of Special Uses
herein -- or changes to such characteristics that conditions to which the
approval is made subject require -- the proposed use will be compatible with
existing uses in the area, and with Permitted Uses in the zoning district, in
the following ways:
1. Traffic
Any adverse impact of types or volumes of traffic flow not otherwise typical in
the zoning district has been minimized.
2. Environmental Nuisance
Any adverse effects of noise, glare, odor, dust, waste disposal, blockage of
light or air, or other adverse environmental effects of a type or degree not
characteristic of Permitted Uses in the zoning district, have been
appropriately controlled.
3. Neighborhood Character
The proposed use will fit harmoniously with the existing natural or man-made
character of its surroundings and with Permitted Uses in the zoning district.
The use will not have undue deleterious effect on the environmental quality,
property values, or neighborhood character already existing in the area or
normally associated with Permitted Uses in the district.
4. Public Services and Facilities
The proposed use will not require existing community facilities or services to
a degree disproportionate to that normally expected of Permitted Uses in the
district, nor generate disproportionate demand for new services or facilities
as compared with the Permitted Uses, in such a way as to place undue burdens
upon existing development in the area.
5. Public Safety and Health
The proposed use will not be detrimental to the safety or health of the
employees, patrons, or visitors associated with the use nor of the general
public in the vicinity.
6. Other Factors
The proposed use is in harmony with any other elements of compatibility
pertinent in the judgment of the Commission or Council to the particular
Special Use or its particular location.
D. SITE PLAN APPROVAL
No building permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued in any district
for any non single-family or non two-family use that involves a change and
increase in the intensity of the basic land use occurring on the property
(examples include changing from residential to office, residential to
institutional, office to restaurant, etc.), increases in the occupant load of
the structure, increases in the building footprint of the existing principal
structures, increases in the volume of the principal structures, and/or
increases in the area of parking lot pavement located on the site without:
   a.   submission of a Site Plan as provided under Site Plan Review in
Table 2C; and
   b.   determination by the Zoning Administrator and by the City Council,
prior to issuance of any such Permit or Certificate, that such Plan is in
compliance with applicable provisions of this and other applicable City
ordinances except where variances thereto have been approved as provided
therein. Such compliance shall include the provision for, and financial
sureties to guarantee the installation of, such public and private improvements
as are required by Subdivision Control Ordinance No. 807, whether or not a
subdivision of land is proposed.
Neither the Zoning Administrator nor the City Council shall deny any such
Permit or Certificate, or make approval thereof subject to conditions, except
on the basis of noncompliance of the application therefor with applicable City
Ordinances including the City roadway improvement requirements outlined in
Section
7-2-3-1 of the City of Warrenville City Code.
The City's review and approval of a Variance, Special Use Permit, and Final PUD
Plan shall satisfy the Site Plan Approval Requirements of this Section. (Ord.
2276, 4-18-06)
E. UNLISTED USES
The City Council may, by amendment to the district regulations, allow in any
district a use not listed as a Permitted or Special Use in that district if:
   1.   the use is not listed either as a Permitted or Special Use in any
district in the Ordinance, and
   2.   the Council deems the use similar in nature to another use listed as a
Permitted or Special Use in the same district with respect to:
         a.   types of goods or services produced or sold
         b.   generation of automobile, truck, or pedestrian traffic
         c.   hours of operation
         d.   general effect upon its environs.
Provisions and restrictions herein applicable to the listed use shall also
apply to the unlisted use to which it is judged similar. The Zoning
Administrator may make a recommendation to the Council on the approval of such
uses.

Ordinance by the Zoning Administrator or other authorized administrative
official, board, commission, or department of the City other than the City
Council, may file an Appeal with the Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. APPROVAL PROCESS
Appeals shall be decided only in conformance with the Approval Process provided
in the Filing Procedures section of this Ordinance and the Approval Criteria
herein.
3. NOTICE OF APPEAL
A Notice of Appeal shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator within 20 days
of the date of the order or decision being appealed.
The notice shall contain:
   a.   the name, address, and telephone number of the party filing the appeal,
and
   b.   the location of the property affected by the decision being appealed,
and
   c.   identification of the provision of the Ordinance governing the decision

   b.   was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, or
   c.   constituted an abuse of discretion, or
   d.   was based on an erroneous interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance or
zoning law. (Ord. 1018, 3-11-21)
8. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
A. PURPOSE
The provisions of this section are intended for special situations in which:
   a.   adequate space, light, air, and other objectives of this Ordinance
relating to the public health, safety, and welfare can be achieved without the
literal application of the detailed zoning and subdivision requirements
otherwise applicable, and
   b.   special amenities and benefits to the community beyond those required
by this and other City ordinances can be achieved by allowing more flexible
design than is otherwise permitted by such requirements.
These objectives can be achieved where an area of land is planned for
development as an integrated unit and where its design is subject to more
detailed review and approval by the City than is normally required.
The objective of Planned Unit Development (PUD) is therefore not simply to
allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations. It is instead to
encourage a higher level of design and amenity than it is possible to achieve
under the usual land development requirements.
It is accordingly the intent of the City to suspend the application of detailed
zoning and subdivision standards as provided herein only where such special
amenity is achieved. In this way the City may grant the creative developer a
desirable flexibility and at the same time not only protect but enhance the
welfare of the residents and other users of a development as well as the rest
of the community.
B. QUALIFICATION FOR FILING AS A PUD
Planned Unit Development shall be the only form of development in the SD
District. A PUD may also be developed in any other district in which Planned
Unit Developments are allowed as Special Uses.
No development shall be filed as a Planned Unit Development unless it is
initially under the same ownership or control.
A Planned Unit Development may be residential, commercial, office, industrial,
or a combination thereof. Flexibility to suspend requirements imposed elsewhere
is not conferred upon the PUD applicant as a matter of right but is in all
cases subject to a finding by the City that the objectives of these provisions
will be served thereby.
C. INCENTIVES FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
To further a superior level of design and amenity in new development, the
following incentives are offered in Planned Unit Developments:
1. VARIABLE DIMENSIONAL ZONING STANDARDS
Except as otherwise provided herein, standards for lot width, building height,
floor area ratio, yard dimensions, off-street parking and loading, landscaping
and screening, fences, signs, and other standards may vary from those
established elsewhere in this Ordinance if such variations are approved by the
City Council as conforming to the Approval Criteria in
Table 8A.
2. VARIABLE SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
Dimensional and design standards for subdivisions and subdivision improvements
such as streets, blocks, sidewalks and parkways, but not improvement
construction standards, may vary from those established in the City Subdivision
Control Ordinance No. 807.
3. MIXED LAND USES
Land uses other than those allowed as Permitted or Conditional Uses in the
applicable zoning districts may be permitted. In Residential Districts, no more
than 10 percent of the net area of the development--excluding streets,
retention and detention areas, and other public improvements--shall be devoted
to business uses.
4. VARIABLE DENSITY STANDARDS
The City Council may approve a reduction in minimum lot area or minimum lot
area per dwelling unit of no more than 15 percent provided that no less than 15
percent of the net site area excluding streets is devoted to public or common
private open space. Fifty percent of the area of dry stormwater retention areas
may be counted toward such open space. No less than 25 percent of such open
space shall be suitable for use for active recreation. Maximum floor area ratio
required by the applicable zoning district may be exceeded by no more than 20
percent. This subsection shall not be applicable to an SD District for which a
General Site Plan and SD Development Control Regulations have been approved.
5. ESTABLISHMENT OF SD DEVELOPMENT CONTROL REGULATIONS
At the time of approval of a General Site Plan for the SD District, the City
Council may approve detailed design standards (SD Development Control
Regulations) setting forth the zoning and design standards which shall apply to
development in the SD District. Approval of the SD Development Control
Regulations by the City Council shall be subject to conformance of such
Standards to the Approval Criteria in
Table 8A. To the extent the SD Development Control Regulations are exceptions
from otherwise applicable City ordinances, such exceptions shall be subject to
the Approval Criteria in
Table 8A Article 7A and
Table 7A shall not be applicable to such exceptions. The SD Development Control
Regulations shall supersede any provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision
Ordinance, Landscaping Ordinance, Signage Ordinance, or other City ordinances
which are inconsistent with such SD Development Control Regulations. The SD
Development Control Regulations, as originally approved or as generally amended
thereafter, shall govern all future development and land use in the SD
District. A General Amendment to the SD Development Control Regulations shall
be proposed as a major amendment. All Preliminary and Final Plans must conform
to such SD Development Control Regulations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the owner of a lot or development parcel within
the SD District may request an amendment of the SD Development Control
Regulations as they apply to such lot or development parcel, which request
shall be processed as a site-specific major or minor amendment under Article
8.F.4. Requests for exceptions to otherwise applicable City ordinances as part
of an SD District General Site Plan or a PUD Preliminary Plan or Final Plan
shall also be subject to the Approval Criteria in
Table 8A and shall be processed as part of General Site Plan or Preliminary
Plan approval or as a major amendment to an approved plan under Article 8.F.4.
D. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
1. SITE PLAN REVIEW
Whether or not a land subdivision is involved, Preliminary and Final Plans for
the development shall be filed and approved by the City in conformance with the
provisions of
Table 2D in the Filing Procedures section of this Ordinance.
2. REQUIRED COMMON OPEN SPACE
Dedication or reservation of land for park or school sites shall be as provided
in Ordinance No. 392 for developments or portions thereof that provide for
residential uses.
Except in an SD District, for developments or portions thereof in business,
office, or industrial uses, no less than 15 percent of net site area shall be
common open space. In an SD District the percentage of landscape coverage shall
be governed by the General Site Plan and SD Development Control Regulations for
the SD District.
3. QUALITY OF DESIGN
(Ord. 2593, 6-21-10)
To be granted the flexibility permitted hereunder, a Planned Unit Development
must evidence a level of design and amenities exceeding those typical of
conventional development.
Among the features that may evidence such amenities are:
   a.   amount and quality of landscaping,
   b.   amount, quality, and interconnectedness of common open space,
   c.   provision of pedestrian or bicycle paths separated from streets,
   d.   preservation of drainage ways and other natural features,
   e.   provision of common recreational facilities,
   f.   enclosed, underground, depressed, or outstandingly landscaped parking
areas,
   g.   varied building setbacks or other measures to reduce monotony in
design,
   h.   incorporation of stormwater management Best Management practices
(BMPs),
   i.   incorporation of green building, smart growth and other sustainable
design principles,
   j.   Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and/or LEED
Neighborhood Design (LEED-ND) certifications and/or other nationally recognized
sustainable design criteria and standards, and
   k.   other features as determined by the Plan Commission or City Council.
4. MAINTENANCE OF LAND INTENDED FOR FUTURE PHASES
Land designated for future construction phases and other land not intended for
immediate improvement shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained with a neat
and orderly appearance as specified by the Zoning Administrator.
5. UNDERGROUND UTILITIES
All utility lines within a Planned Unit Development shall be installed
underground, except that the City Council may permit electrical transmission
regional service lines to be located aboveground in an SD District as part of
the General Site Plan.
6. DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
Lot coverage by buildings shall not exceed 25 percent on single-family detached
residential lots and 30 percent on all other lots. In Residential Districts,
yards required by applicable zoning district regulations shall be provided on
lots abutting the boundaries of the development. All business and industrial
buildings shall be no less than 50 feet, and all other buildings no less than
30 feet, from such boundaries. No building height shall exceed 45 feet except
as otherwise provided in
Table 4C above. This subsection shall not be applicable to an SD District for
which a General Site Plan and SD Development Control Regulations have been
approved.
7. PARKING SPACE RESERVE
Except as otherwise provided in SD Development Control Regulations, up to 25
percent of the parking spaces required herein for office, laboratory, and
commercial uses may be shown as unimproved parking space reserve areas on the
Preliminary and Final Plans required herein, provided that:
   a.   an alternative version of the Plan is filed with the Plan and is
approved by the City Council that shows the configuration of the reserve areas
when fully improved with parking spaces and related landscaping, marking,
illumination, and other accoutrements, and
   b.   the Plan shows the landscaping of the reserve areas that is proposed to
be installed and maintained until such areas are required for parking, and,
unless such maintenance has been made a condition of the Special Use approval
for Planned Unit Development, is accompanied by an agreement approved by the
City Council binding the applicant to maintain such landscaping until such
time, and
   c.   if at any time after the issuance of the last certificate of occupancy
for a project, after notice to the owner and an opportunity to be heard, the
City determines that the land banked parking, or any portion of such parking,
is necessary to alleviate an observed parking problem, the City Council through
a motion can require the owner of the subject property to install the land
banked parking within one hundred eighty (180) days of the action by the City
Council.
E. APPROVAL PROCESS
(Ord. O2017-26, 5-15-17)
   1.   Preliminary Plans and Final Plans for all Planned Unit Development and
General Site Plans for SD Districts (including Development Control Regulations
associated therewith) shall be approved only in conformance with the Approval
Process provided in
Table 2D and other provisions of the Filing Procedures section of this
Ordinance and the Approval Criteria provide in
Table 8A. No Special Use Permit for a PUD or phase thereof shall be issued
before approval by the City Council of a Final Plan as provided herein.
   2.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8 or in the
City Subdivision Control Ordinance No. 807, the City Council may, within its
reasonable discretion, authorize the issuance of a "Quick Start" grading and/or
infrastructure installation permit at the developer's risk prior to the City
Council's approval of the necessary Ordinances required for Final PUD approval
of a specific project or development. However, in each such case, the
infrastructure which may be installed under a "Quick Start" installation permit
shall be limited to those particular infrastructure components which have
received final engineering review and approval by the City Council.
F. FINAL PLAN
1. FILING OF FINAL PLAN
The City Council may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a Final Plan of a
Planned Unit Development, or any phase thereof, for which it has approved a
Preliminary Plan. The Final Plan may be filed, and may be approved,
simultaneously with the Preliminary Plan.
The terms, conditions, and requirements set forth in a Preliminary Plan, or any
phase thereof, approved by the City Council shall not be modified, revoked, or
impaired by the City except as provided under Revocation or Invalidation in the
Filing Procedures chapter herein.
The financial sureties submitted with the Final Plan in conformance with
Table 2A herein shall provide for the phasing of the installation and
improvement of public or common areas and improvements, open spaces, and

Table 8A: Approval Criteria for Planned Unit Developments
In recommending approval or conditional approval of a General Site Plan for an
SD District Development (including Development Control Regulations associated
therewith) or a Preliminary or Final Plan for a Planned Unit Development (PUD),
the Plan Commission shall transmit to the City Council written findings of fact
that the application meets all of the criteria below or will meet them when the
Commission's conditions are complied with. The City Council shall, in granting
approval or conditional approval, also find that all of the following criteria
are met or will be met when the conditions to which the approval is made
subject are complied with:
1. SUPERIOR DESIGN (Ord. 2593 6-21-10)
The PUD represents a more creative approach to the unified planning of
development and incorporates sustainable design practices (i.e., Stormwater
Management BMPs, LEED and/or LEED-ND certifications), and/or other nationally
recognized sustainable design criteria and standards, and a higher standard of
integrated design and amenities than could be achieved under otherwise
applicable zoning district and subdivision regulations, and solely on this
basis modifications to the use and design standards established by such
regulations are warranted.
2. MEETS PUD REQUIREMENTS
The PUD meets the requirements for Planned Unit Developments set forth in this
Ordinance, and no modifications to the use and design standards otherwise
applicable are allowed other than those permitted herein.
3. CONSISTENT WITH CITY PLAN
The PUD is generally consistent with the objectives of the City Comprehensive
Plan as viewed in light of any changed conditions since its adoption.
4. PUBLIC WELFARE
The PUD will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, or
general welfare.
5. COMPATIBLE WITH ENVIRONS
Neither the PUD nor any portion thereof will be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other properties in its vicinity, seriously impair property values
or environmental quality in the neighborhood, nor impede the orderly
development of surrounding property.
6. NATURAL FEATURES
The design of the PUD is as consistent as practical with the preservation of
natural features of the site such as flood plains, wooded areas, steep slopes,
natural drainage ways, or other areas of sensitive or valuable environmental
character.
7. CIRCULATION
Streets, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bicycle paths, off-street parking, and
off-street loading as appropriate to the planned land uses are provided. They
are adequate in location, size, capacity, and design to ensure safe and
efficient circulation of automobiles, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians, fire
trucks, garbage trucks, and snow plows as appropriate without blocking traffic,
creating unnecessary pedestrian-vehicular conflict, creating unnecessary
through traffic within the PUD, or unduly interfering with the safety or
capacity of adjacent streets.
8. OPEN SPACES AND LANDSCAPING
The quality and quantity of public and common open spaces and landscaping
provided are consistent with the higher standards of design and amenity
required of a PUD. The size, shape, and location of a substantial portion of
total public and common open space provided in residential areas render it
useable for recreation purposes.
Open space between all buildings is adequate to allow for light and air, access
by fire fighting equipment, and for privacy where walls have windows, terraces,
or adjacent patios. Open space along the perimeter of the development is
sufficient to protect existing and permitted future uses of adjacent property
from adverse effects from the development.
9. COVENANTS
Where individual parcels are to be later sold, adequate provision has been made
in the form of deed restrictions, homeowners or condominium associations, or
the like for:
   a.   the preservation and maintenance of any open spaces, thoroughfares,
utilities, water retention or detention areas, and other common elements not to
be dedicated to the City or another public body
   b.   such control of the use and exterior design of individual structures,
if any, as is necessary for continuing conformance to the PUD Plan, such
provision to be binding on all future ownership.
10. PUBLIC SERVICES
The land uses, intensities, and phasing of the PUD are consistent with the
anticipated ability of the City, the school districts, and other public bodies
to provide and economically support police and fire protection, water supply,
sewage disposal, schools, and other public facilities and services without
placing undue burden on existing residents and businesses.
11. PHASING
Each development phase of the PUD can, together with any phases that preceded
it, exist as an independent unit that meets all of the foregoing criteria and
all other applicable regulations herein even if no subsequent phase should ever
be completed. The provision and improvement of public or common area
improvements, open spaces, and amenities--or the provision of financial
sureties guaranteeing their improvement--is phased generally proportionate to
the phasing of the number of dwelling units or amount of non-residential floor
area. (Ord. 1018, 3-11-21; amd. Ord. O2022-13, 4-18-2022)
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
A. PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY
The requirements herein are intended to provide a basis for determining the
compatibility of land uses that may produce measurable adverse environmental
effects on their surroundings.
They shall apply to all uses in the City and shall be administered as provided
under Administration herein. (Ord. 1018, 3-11-21)
B. NOISE
1. MAXIMUM SOUND LEVELS
No operation or activity shall cause or create noise above the sound pressure
levels in Tables
9A and
9B at the locations specified therein.
2. MEASUREMENT
A sound level meter and associated octave band analyzer conforming to the
specifications of the American Standards Association shall be employed to
measure the intensity and frequency of sound.
3. EXEMPTIONS
The following shall be exempt from noise performance standards:
   a.   Noises of construction or maintenance activities from 7 AM to 9 PM.
   b.   Noises of safety signals, warning devices, and emergency pressure
relief valves.
   c.   Transient noises of moving sources such as transportation vehicles.
   d.   Noises associated with snow plowing, street sweeping, and mosquito
abatement.
   e.   Church bells, chimes, and carillons.

measures used to achieve such a measurable average annual milligauss level. The
property owner shall also identify any measure which could reduce the
measurable average annual milligauss levels but which was not deemed
reasonable. In addition, such study shall include a documented projection of
the anticipated measurable average milligauss level at any property line.
N. ADMINISTRATION
The procedures herein are intended to enforce the Performance Standards herein,
to protect businesses from arbitrary enforcement, and to protect the public
from unnecessary enforcement costs.
1. NEW USES
An application for a Special Use Permit or a Building Permit for an industrial
use within any Manufacturing District shall include a certification by a
licensed engineer or scientific laboratory that the use involved in the
application is able to meet all applicable Performance Standards to the extent
that this can be judged based on the submitted building plans and other
information available prior to construction.
This certification shall be accompanied by copies of all data or information
supplied by the applicant and used as the basis of the certification. The
Zoning Administrator may refer the certification and data to the City Engineer
for review.
The Zoning Administrator may also require such certification for a land use in
any other zoning district when in his or her judgment the use has potential to
exceed any Performance Standard herein. Such certification may include all
Performance Standards or only individual Standards specified by the Zoning
Administrator.
2. EXISTING USES
In enforcing Performance Standards on existing uses, the Zoning Administrator
may issue a written Notice of Violation to an alleged violator. The Zoning
Administrator shall, before issuing such Notice, make technical determinations
of violation when such determinations can be made using equipment and trained
personnel normally available to the City or obtainable without extraordinary
expense.
In other cases, however, technical complexity or extraordinary expense may make
it unreasonable for the City to maintain personnel or equipment for making
determinations of violation prior to issuing a Notice of Violation. In such
cases, a Notice of Violation may be issued when the Zoning Administrator has
other reason to believe there is probable violation. The Zoning Administrator
shall give Notice of Violation by any means that ensures a signed receipt for
such notice to the party responsible for the alleged violation.
The notice shall describe the alleged violation and the results of technical
determinations or the other reasons why the Zoning Administrator believes there
is a violation. The notice shall require either an answer or correction of the
alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator and within a
time limit he or she shall specify in the Notice.
The Notice shall also state that failure to provide an answer or correct the
alleged violation within this time limit shall constitute admission of a
violation.
The Notice shall further state that, if technical determinations have not
already been made, upon request of the alleged violator such determinations
will be made. If a violation is found as a result of such determinations, the
cost of the determinations will be assessed against the properties or parties
responsible in addition to any other penalties provided for. If no violation is
found, the City will pay the cost of the determinations.

D. SELECTION, INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PLANT MATERIALS
1. SELECTION
Planting materials used in conformance with the provisions of this Section
shall be of good quality, species normally grown in Northeastern Illinois, and
capable of withstanding the extremes of individual site microclimates. Size and
density at the time of planting and at maturity are additional criteria which
must be considered when selecting plant materials. See the Arboricultural and
Open Space Manual for recommended and unacceptable plant materials. Plants
which clearly show signs of disease shall not be permitted and must be replaced
at the owner's expense.
   a.   Shade Trees
      All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of 2-1/2 (two and one-
half) inches in diameter as measured one foot above the established ground
level upon installation.
   b.   Ornamental Trees
      Ornamental trees should be used, especially in small areas. These trees
shall have a minimum trunk size of 2 (two) inches in diameter as measured one
foot above the established ground level upon installation, or be a clump form
at a height of at least 7-8 (seven to eight) feet.
   c.   Evergreen Trees
      Evergreen trees should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a
site, particularly in those areas screening parking lots from dedicated public
rights-of-way or property zoned for residential use. All evergreen trees shall
have a minimum height of 6 (six) feet at planting.
   d.   Shrubs
      Shrubs should be used extensively throughout the development. Shrubs
shall be a minimum of 2-1/2 (two and one-half) feet in height when measured
after planting, except for dwarf shrubs which do not reach this height at
maturity. Dwarf shrub size shall be approved by the Community Development
Director. Hedges shall be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous,
unbroken, solid visual screen within 1 (one) year after time of planting.
2. INSTALLATION
All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the planting
procedures set forth in the Arboricultural and Open Space Manual.
3. MAINTENANCE
   a.   Responsibility
      The owner of the premises shall be responsible for the maintenance,
repair and replacement of all landscaping materials and barriers, including
refuse disposal areas, as may be required by the provisions of this Chapter, in
accordance with the approved Landscape Plan, Landscape Maintenance Plan and
Landscape Maintenance Calendar for as long as the use/development for which the
landscape plan was approved is in existence. (Ord. 2770, 4-3-13)
      b.   Landscaping Materials
         All landscaping materials, including mulch, shall be maintained in
good condition and shall be replaced when necessary so as to present a healthy,
neat and orderly appearance, and shall be kept free of refuse and debris.
      c.   Fences and Walls
         Fences, walls and other barriers shall be maintained in good repair.
      d.   Planting Beds
         Planting beds should be mulched with shredded bark, wood chips, or
other similar materials.
      e.   Top Soil
         A cover of at least 6 (six) inches of topsoil shall be provided in
turfed areas. A cover of at least 9 (nine) inches of topsoil shall be provided
in all planting beds.
4. RESTRICTED PLANTING MATERIALS
(Ord. 2346, 12-15-06)
The following plant species shall not be used to satisfy minimum planting
requirements of Chapter 11, Landscaping and Screening:
   a.   Ash tree
   b.   Scots (Scotch) pine
   c.   Austrian pine
E. DESIGN CRITERIA
1. SCALE AND NATURE OF LANDSCAPE MATERIAL
The scale and nature of landscape material should be appropriate to the site
and structures. Large scale buildings, for example, should generally be
complemented by larger scale plants.
2. SELECTION OF PLANT MATERIAL
Plant material should be selected for its form, texture, color, concern for its
ultimate growth, durability, maintenance requirements and contribution to local
ecosystem. See the Arboricultural and Open Space Manual for lists of plant
materials recommended and not acceptable for planting. The use of native and
adapted to northern Illinois plants is encouraged.
Native (or indigenous) plants have been described as having "evolved and
adapted to local conditions over thousands of years." In North America, the
term often refers to plants growing in a region prior to the time of settlement
by people of European descent.
Adapted (or introduced) plants have been described as those that "reliably grow
well in a given habitat with minimal winter protection, pest control,
fertilization, or irrigation once their root systems are established."
Native and adapted plants are low maintenance plants. Since they have adapted
to the regional climate without benefit of irrigation or chemical fertilizers,
they require less water and no chemicals and, as a result, cost less to
maintain. They also cost less to maintain because they have developed a
resistance to most pests and diseases and generally do not require the
application of pesticides. The cost of labor to control weeds is also reduced.
Unlike many landscape plants that are selected almost exclusively for their
aesthetic appeal, native plants are not only attractive, but also enrich the
local ecosystem by providing food and shelter to many birds, butterflies and
other animals. (Ord. 2770, 4-3-13)
3. SOFTENING OF APPEARANCE OF WALLS AND FENCES
Groupings of plant materials should be placed intermittently against long
expanses of building walls, fences and other barriers to create a softening
effect.
4. ENERGY CONSERVATION
In order to help conserve energy, the following landscaping measures are
encouraged, where feasible:
   a.   Deciduous trees, shrubs, and vines should be placed on the south and
west sides of buildings and plaza areas to provide shade from the summer sun.
   b.   Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the
north side of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
5. BERMING
Earthen berms and existing topography should, wherever practical, be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site. Slopes should be no
greater than 1 (vertical) in 3 (horizontal) gradient.
F. RIGHT-OF-WAY LANDSCAPING
1. APPLICABILITY
Where a parcel abuts a dedicated public right-of-way, landscaping shall be
provided in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
2. TURF
The unpaved portion of a public right-of-way abutting a parcel shall be fine-
graded and sodded. In instances where any of the following conditions are
present, the Community development Director or his/her designated
representative may approve the use of hydro seeding or a seed and blanket
combination in lieu of sod: (Ord. 2770, 4-3-13)
   a.   No foot traffic expected
   b.   Limited access to source of water for regular application
   c.   Steeply sloped area
3. STREET TREES
Street trees shall be planted on private property unless the property owner,
development Homeowners' Association, or developer of a subdivision executes a
"Landscaping License Agreement' substantially in the form of the agreement
provided in Appendix A of the Arboricultural and Open Space Manual and said
agreement is approved by the Warrenville City Council in which case parkway
trees may be planted in the parkway of streets under City of Warrenville
jurisdiction.
   a.   Selection
      See the Arboricultural and Open Space Manual for acceptable and
unacceptable tree species for right-of-way planting, species diversity
requirements, and nursery stock size and grade requirements.
   b.   Number of Trees Required
      (i.)   The minimum number of street trees required shall be either one
tree for every 40 (forty) linear feet of parcel-to-right-of-way boundary, or
one tree per 800 (eight hundred) square feet of parkway area, whichever is
larger.
      (ii.)   When the parcel is subdivided into lots, at least I (one) street
tree for each lot shall be provided.
   c.   Location and Spacing
      Street tree plantings that are not evenly spaced may be grouped, with a
minimum spacing of at least 15 feet between trees. See the Arboricultural and
Open Space Manual for additional street (parkway) tree location and spacing
requirements.
4. OTHER RIGHT-OF-WAY PLANTINGS
With the execution and approval of a Landscaping License Agreement
substantially in the form of Appendix A, shrubs and perennial plants and
grasses, especially native prairie or savannah plantings, may be used in
addition to street trees. See the Arboricultural and Open Space Manual for
additional right-of-way planting size and location requirements.
G. PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING
1. APPLICABILITY
All developments with 10 (ten) or more parking spaces shall provide Perimeter
Parking Lot Landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Section. All
developments with 20 (twenty) or more parking spaces shall provide Interior
Parking Lot Landscaping in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
2. INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING
   a.   Coverage
      Not less than 10 (ten) percent of the interior of a parking lot shall be

pedestrian pathways within an interior landscape peninsulas and planting
islands shall not exceed one-third of the landscaped area.
      (ii.)   Spacing - Planting islands and/or peninsulas shall be located not
less than every 10 spaces and at the end of every row of parking spaces.
      (iii.)   Alternative Design - Larger landscape islands with bioswales,
where appropriate, may be provided in lieu of interior parking lot landscape
planting islands and/or peninsulas every 10 parking spaces. Such alternative
interior parking lot landscaping shall be authorized by the City through either
the preliminary and/or final PUD Plan review and approval process and shall not
trigger the need for a public hearing or the approval of a Site Specific
Amendment or Site Specific exception.
      (iv.)   Visibility - Visual sight lines at intersections, including
intersections within the parking area, shall not be impeded by landscaping
material. (Ord. 2770, 4-3-13)
   c.   Landscaping Material
      (i.)   Type - The primary landscaping materials used in parking lots
shall be trees which provide shade or are capable of providing shade.
Ornamental trees, shrubbery, hedges, and other live planting materials may be

planting area shall contain at least one shade tree.
3. PERIMETER PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING
   a.   Front and Corner Side Yards Across from Residential Property
      (i.)   Landscaping - Where a parking lot is located across a dedicated
public right-of-way from property zoned for residential use, continuous
landscaping of evergreen or dense deciduous shrubs shall be provided across 100
(one hundred) percent of the street frontage. "Continuous landscaping" shall be
achieved with a planting rate equal to 1 (one) shrub every 5 (five) lineal
feet. Shrubs shall be installed at a height of no less than 2-1/2 (two and one-
half) feet, and shall reach a mature height of at least 4 (four) feet. The
height of such shrubs may be reduced if berming is provided so that the
combined height of shrubs and berming is not less than 4 (four) feet. Spacing
between adjacent shrubs in such shrub masses shall not exceed 5 (five) feet.
         Other landscaping materials, including ornamental trees, evergreens,
shrubs, and/or other live planting material, are encouraged at appropriate
locations along the street frontage.
      (ii.)   Turf - Except where occupied by planting beds, all landscaping
areas located in front and comer side yards shall be sodded or planted with
native or adapted plant materials. In instances where any of the following
conditions are present, the Community Development Director or his/her
designated representative may approve the use of hydro seeding or a seed and
blanket combinations in lieu of sod: (Ord. 2770, 4-3-13)
         (a.)   No foot traffic expected

apply, landscaping shall be provided to conform with the following
requirements.
      (i.)   Planting Materials - Where a parking lot abuts property zoned for
non-residential use, landscaping of evergreen or dense deciduous shrubs shall
be provided across 50% (fifty percent) of that portion of the parking lot
abutting the property line. This requirement shall be achieved with a planting
rate equal to one (1) shrub every ten (10) lineal feet. Shrubs shall be
installed at a height of no less than 2-1/2 (two and one-half) feet, and shall
reach a mature height of at least 4 (four) feet. The height of such shrubs may

protection against deterioration and obsolescence.
   E.   To limit and control the pollution of the environment that can be
caused by inadequate or incomplete urban development.

relationship between the City and the subdivider.

land.
   The regulations are established with reasonable consideration of the
character of the City with a view toward conserving the value of buildings upon
the land and providing the best possible environment for human habitation. It
is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the
enforcement of the provisions and development standards contained in the
Building Code, Official Map Regulations, Zoning Ordinance, and the Official
City Comprehensive Plan.

11-1-5: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Interpretation:
      1.   Minimum Standards Established: In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      2.   Higher Standards Govern: Where the conditions imposed by any
provisions of this chapter upon the subdivision of land are either more
restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other
provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution,
rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and
impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
      3.   Easements Or Covenants Not Abrogated: This chapter is not intended
to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement, provided
that where the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose
higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant, or other private
agreement, the requirements of this chapter shall govern.
      4.   Existing Subdivisions: No subdivision of land, which was not
lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, shall be made
lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this chapter; and, to the extent
that said subdivision of land is in conflict in any manner with the
requirements of this chapter, said subdivision of land remains unlawful
hereunder.
   B.   Separability: It is hereby declared to be the intention of the City
Council of the City of Warrenville that the several provisions of this chapter
be separable in accordance with the following:
      1.   Separability Of Parts: If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
adjudge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, such judgment shall not
affect any other provision of this chapter not specifically included in said
judgment.
      2.   Separability Of Application: If any court of competent jurisdiction
shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this chapter to a
particular subdivision of land, such judgment shall not affect the application
of said provision to any other subdivision of land, not specifically included
in said judgment.
   C.   Unsuitable Land:
      1.   Subdivision Of Unsuitable Land: No land shall be subdivided for any
use which is determined by the City Council after investigation by the City
Engineer, to be unsuitable for such a use by reason of the presence of flood
plain, poor drainage or wetland areas, adverse earth and rock formation or
topography, or any other features likely to be harmful to the health, safety or
welfare of the future residents in the proposed subdivision or of the
community, except under the following conditions:
         a.   Unsuitable land located within areas of special flood hazard may
be subdivided only if the subdivider has complied with Ordinance No. 1189,
Chapter 8-5 Municipal Code, Flood Plain And Storm Water Management.

make the area safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage
and storm water detention facilities.
         d.   Where the developer or subdivider of land outside areas of
special flood hazard can show in writing and with appropriate documentation
that the strict adherence to the design standards set forth causes an
unnecessary hardship, the City Council may approve a variance. Such variance
may be granted after recommendation by the Plan Commission, and where
topography and conditions peculiar to the site or surrounding area substantiate
a variance without destroying the intent of the provisions of this chapter.
      2.   Prohibition From Subdividing: The City Council may, when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit subdivision of any portion of the property
which lies within the flood plain of any stream or drainage course. These flood
plain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting
from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth, waste material, or stumps. (Refer
to Ordinance No. 1189, Chapter 8-5 Municipal Code.)
   D.   Plan Commission Guidelines:
      1.   Particular Attention Of The Plan Commission: The Plan Commission, in
the examination of subdivision plans for approval, and in the application of
this chapter, shall take into consideration the requirements of the community
and the best use of the land being subdivided. Particular attention shall be
given to width and location of streets, suitable sanitary utilities, storm
water drainage, lot sizes and arrangements, as well as local requirements such
as parks and playgrounds, schools and recreation sites, and other public uses.
      2.   Conformity With Comprehensive Plan: The Plan Commission shall
especially require that all subdivisions conform to the provisions and
conditions of the Comprehensive Plan. Plat approval may be withheld if a
subdivision does not conform to the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan.
      3.   Area Plan Required: Where a tract of land proposed for subdivision
is part of a larger, logical subdivision unit in relation to the City as a
whole, the Plan Commission may, before recommending approval, request that the
subdivider submit a plan for the entire area or neighborhood to be used by the
Plan Commission as an aid in judging the proposed plat.
      4.   Storm Water Provisions Required: The Plan Commission shall not
recommend for approval by the City Council any plat of subdivision which does
not make adequate provisions for storm or flood water runoff channel or basins.
      5.   Preservation Of Natural Features: In all subdivisions due regard
shall be given to the preservation of natural features such as large trees,
watercourses, historical sites or structures, and similar features.
      6.   Engineering Standards And Specifications: The Plan Commission shall
require that all subdivisions conform to the Engineering Standards and
Specifications of the City of Warrenville.
   E.   Dedication Of Land For Public Use:
      1.   Acceptance Of Designated Land: When a final plat of a subdivision
has been approved by the City Council and all other required approvals are
obtained and the plat is recorded, that approval shall constitute acceptance
for the purpose designated on the plat of all lands shown on the plat as
dedicated to the public, excepting, street dedications which shall be accepted
only after inspection and recommendation by the City Engineer.
      2.   Refusal Of Designated Land: Whenever a preliminary plat includes a
proposed dedication of land to public use and the Plan Commission finds that
such land is not required or not suitable for public use, the Plan Commission
may either refuse to approve such dedication or require the rearrangement of
lots in the proposed subdivision to include such land.
      3.   Minimum Dedication: For minimum dedication of land for public use
exclusive of public dedicated roads refer to City of Warrenville Code, Section
8-12-1, Dedication of Land or Cash Contribution.
      4.   Contribution Of Sites Or Funds Required: No final plat shall be
approved until such time as the subdivider shall have fully complied with the
provisions of City of Warrenville City Code, Section
8-12-1.
   F.   Vacation Of A Plat Of Subdivision:
      1.   Any plat or any part of a plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lot therein or before any
improvements have been made to any lot, by a written instrument, to which a
copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the- same to be vacated. Except
in the case of a single-family home site, the written instrument of vacation
shall also include a plat of resubdivision in accordance with Section
11-1-6 of this chapter.
      2.   The written instrument of vacation shall be considered by the City
Council in like manner as plats of subdivision. The City Council may reject any
such instrument which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its
streets or public utility easements. Such instrument shall be reviewed and
approved by the Plan Commission; executed, acknowledged or approved, and

AGENT OR BROKER:
1.   The Contractor and the Surety, jointly and severally, bind themselves,
their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns to the Obligee
for the completion of the Subdivision Improvements in a timely manner.
2.   If the Contractor completes the Subdivision Improvements, the Surety and
the Contractor shall have no obligation under this Bond, except to participate
in conferences as provided in Subparagraph 3.1.
3.   The Surety's obligation under this bond shall arise after:
3.1   The Obligee has notified the Contractor and the Surety at its address
described in Paragraph 10 below that the Obligee is considering declaring a
Contractor Default and has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with
the Contractor and the Surety to be held not later than 15 days after receipt
of such notice to discuss methods of completing the Subdivision Improvements.
If the Obligee, the Contractor and the Surety agree, the Contractor shall be
allowed to complete the Subdivision Improvements, but such an agreement shall
not waive the Obligee's right, if any, subsequently, to declare a Contractor
Default; and
3.2   The Obligee has declared a Contractor Default. Such Contractor Default
shall not be declared earlier than 20 days after the Contractor and the Surety
have received notice as provided in Subparagraph 3.1.
3.3   Simultaneously with a declaration of Contractor Default by the Obligee,
or within a reasonable period of time thereafter, the Obligee shall notify the
Surety of the actions that the Obligee requires in order to remedy the
Contractor Default. Pursuant to the Obligee's instructions, the Surety shall
either:
3.3.1   Within 30 days, pay to the Obligee the full amount of the Performance
Bond. The Obligee shall thereupon utilize the bond proceeds solely to cause
completion of the work or to cause correction of defective work associated with
the Subdivision Improvements. Any bond proceeds remaining after the completion
of the work or the correction of defective work shall be returned to the Surety
by the Obligee; or
3.3.2   Undertake to perform and complete the Subdivision Improvements itself,
through its agents or through independent contractors; or
3.3.3   Obtain bids or negotiated proposals from qualified contractors
acceptable to the Obligee for a contract for performance and completion of the
Subdivision Improvements, arrange for a contract to be prepared for execution
by the Obligee and the contractor selected with the Obligee's concurrence, to
be secured with performance and payment bonds executed by a qualified surety
equivalent to the bonds issued on the Subdivision Improvements, and pay to the
Obligee the amount of damages as described in Paragraph 5.
3.4   The Obligee's determination of which course of action the Surety must
pursue under Paragraph 3.3 in order to remedy a Contractor's Default shall be
final.
4.   If the Surety does not proceed as provided in Paragraph 3 in a timely
manner, the Surety shall be deemed to be in default on this Bond.
5.   After the Obligee has terminated the Contractor's right to complete the
Subdivision Improvements, then the responsibilities of the Surety to the
Obligee shall not be greater than those of the Contractor under the Subdivision
Improvements. To the limit of the amount of this Bond, the Surety is obligated
without duplication for:
5.1   The responsibilities of the Contractor for correction of defective work
and completion of the Subdivision Improvements;
5.2   Any and all legal fees, engineering and design professional fees, and all
costs related to the delay, including but not limited to increased labor and
material costs resulting from the acts or failure to act on behalf of the
Surety pursuant to Paragraphs 3 and 4; and
5.3   Actual damages caused by delayed performance or non-performance of the
Contractor.
6.   The Surety shall not be liable to the Obligee or others for obligations of
the Contractor that are unrelated to the Subdivision Improvements. No right of
action shall accrue on this Bond to any person or entity other than the Obligee
or its heirs, executors, administrators or successors.
7.   The Surety hereby waives notice of any change, including changes of time,
to the Subdivision Improvements or to related subcontracts, purchase orders and
other obligations.
8.   Any action, legal or equitable, under this Bond shall be brought only in
the Circuit Court of Illinois in the judicial circuit in which the contract is
to be performed. Such action must be brought within four years after the Surety
refuses or fails to perform as required by the Obligee in Paragraph 3.
9.   In the event the Surety fails to perform its obligations hereunder in a
timely manner, the Obligee may commence legal proceedings in a court of
competent jurisdiction in the location where the Subdivision Improvements are
situated, and the Surety shall be responsible for the payment of all the
Obligee's attorneys' fees and costs incurred in such proceeding, which
attorneys' fees and costs shall be in addition to, and not limited in any
manner by, the principal amount of this Bond.
10.   Notice to the surety, the Obligee or the Contractor shall be mailed or
delivered to the address shown on the signature page.
11.   DEFINITIONS
11.1   Subdivision Improvements: Those improvements identified in Exhibit 1-
A attached hereto.
11.2   Contractor Default: Failure of the Contractor, which has neither been
remedied nor waived.

such claims, demands, liens or suits to the Contractor and the Surety, and
provided there is no Obligee Default.
3.   With respect to Claimants, this obligation shall be null and void if the

   4.2   Claimants who do not have a direct contract with the Contractor:
      a.   Have furnished written notice to the Contractor and sent a copy, or

      b.   Have either received a rejection in whole or in part from the
Contractor, or not received within 30 days of furnishing the above notice any
communication from the Contractor by which the Contractor has indicated the
claim will be paid directly or indirectly; and
      c.   Not having been paid within the above 30 days, have sent a written

under this Bond and enclosing a copy of the previous written notice furnished
to the Contractor.
5.   If a notice required by Paragraph 4 is given by Obligee to the Contractor

funds for the completion of the work.
9.   The Surety shall not be liable to Obligee, Claimants or others for
obligations of the Contractor that are unrelated o the Subdivision

10.   The Surety hereby waives notice of any change, including changes of time,
to the Subdivision Improvements or to related subcontracts, purchase orders and
other obligations.
11.   No suit or action shall be commenced by a Claimant under this Bond other

bond.
