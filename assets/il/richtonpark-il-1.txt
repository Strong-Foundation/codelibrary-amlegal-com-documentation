EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is consistent with
the best accepted practice for codification. Each section is self-identifying
as to code, chapter and section number. For example, 238.02 indicates that the
code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th chapter within code
2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter numbers appear left of
the decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal.
The section number appears to the right of the decimal. As another example,
408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the chapter number is 408 (or the
8th chapter within code 4), and the section number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99. Newly created sections subsequent to the original
codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event
the law properly belongs between consecutively numbered sections. For example,
newly created 660.041, 660.042 and 660.043 follow 660.04 and precede 660.05 to
be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter which was ordained by the ordinance adopting these Codified
Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

January 31, 1934, as amended (Illinois R.S. Chapter 43, Section 95.05).
(1976 Code §12-57.)
212.02 BASIS FOR DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY.
   The President of the Board of Trustees may declare that a state of emergency
exists in the Village or any part thereof whenever he or she determines that
there has been an act of violence, a flagrant and substantial defiance of, or
resistance to, a lawful exercise of public authority or a natural disaster or
man-made calamity, including flood, conflagration, cyclone, tornado, earthquake
or explosion, within the limits of the Village, resulting in the death or
injury of persons or the destruction of property to such an extent that
extraordinary measures must be taken to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, and that, partly on account thereof, there is reason to believe that
there exists a clear and present danger of a riot or other general public
disorder, widespread disobedience of the law and substantial injury to persons
or to property, all of which constitute a threat to public peace or order and
to the general welfare of the Village or a part thereof.
(1976 Code § 12-58.)
212.03 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   (a)   Whenever the President of the Board of Trustees, pursuant to Section
212.02, determines that a state of emergency exists, he or she shall first
sign, under oath, a statement in writing finding that the standards set forth
in Section
212.02 have been met, and shall set forth facts in such statement to
substantiate such findings. Such statement shall also describe the emergency
and shall declare that a state of emergency exists. After the signing of such
statement, the following measures shall, where applicable, be in effect:
      (1)   The emergency measures provided in subsection (b) hereof shall
thereupon be in effect during the period of the emergency and throughout the
Village.
      (2)   The Village Manager may order and promulgate all or any of the
emergency measures provided in subsection (b) hereof, in whole or in part, with
such limitations and conditions as he or she may deem appropriate, and any such
emergency measure so ordered and promulgated shall thereupon be in effect
during the period of the emergency and in the area for which the emergency has
been declared.
   (b)   The emergency measures may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   The prohibition of the sale or other transfer of possession, with
or without consideration, the offer to sell or so transfer and the purchase, of
any ammunition, gun or other firearm of any size or description;
      (2)   The prohibition of the displaying by or in any store or shop of any
ammunition or gun or other firearm of any size or description;
      (3)   The prohibition of the possession, in a public place, of a rifle or
shotgun by a person, except a duly authorized law enforcement official or
person in the military service acting in the official performance of his or her
duty;
      (4)   The prohibition of the possession of a rifle or shotgun in any
place, public or private;
      (5)   The establishment of curfews, including, but not limited to, the
prohibition or restriction of pedestrian and vehicular movement, standing and
parking, but not including the provision of designated essential services such
as fire, police and hospital services, including the transportation of patients
to a hospital, utility emergency repairs and emergency calls by physicians;
      (6)   The prohibition of the sale of alcoholic liquor;
      (7)   The prohibition of a person's having on his or her person, in a
public place, a portable container containing alcoholic liquor;
      (8)   The closing of places of public assemblage, with designated
exceptions; and
      (9)   The prohibition of the sale or other transfer of possession, with
or without consideration, of gasoline or any other flammable or combustible
liquid, except by delivery into a tank properly affixed to an operable motor-
driven vehicle, bike, scooter, boat or airplane and necessary for the
propulsion thereof.
(1976 Code § 12-59.)
212.04 FILING AND NOTICE.
   Any state of emergency or emergency measure declared or ordered and
promulgated under this chapter shall, as promptly as is practical, be filed
with the Village Clerk and be delivered to appropriate news media for
publication and radio and television broadcast thereby. If practical, such
state of emergency declaration or emergency measure shall also be publicized by
other appropriate means, such as by posting or broadcasting over loudspeakers.
(1976 Code § 12-60.)
212.05 DURATION; AUTHORITY OF BOARD OF TRUSTEES.
   A state of emergency established under this chapter shall commence upon
declaration thereof by the President of the Board of Trustees and shall
terminate not later than the adjournment of the first regular meeting of the
Board after the state of emergency is declared. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed as limiting the power of the Board to declare, by ordinance, a
curfew throughout all or part of the Village or adopt such emergency measures
as may be required.
(1976 Code § 12-61.)

   (b)   Restricted Activities.
      (1)   No elected or appointed official shall be interested, directly or
indirectly, in any contract, work or business of the Village, or in the sale of
any article, whenever the expense, price or consideration of the contract,
work, business or sale is paid either from the treasury or by any assessment
levied by any statute or ordinance. No elected or appointed official shall be
interested, directly or indirectly, in the purchase of any property which
belongs to the Village, is sold for taxes or assessments or is sold by virtue
of legal process at a suit of the Village.
      (2)   The Village may enter into a contract with any person, in which an
elected or appointed member of the Village corporate authorities has an
interest, direct or indirect, provided that the following requirements are met:
         A.   If the amount of the contract does not exceed two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) and the total of such contracts awarded to the same person in
a given year does not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), the contract may
be entered into without violating the conflict of interest laws.
         B.   If the amount of the contract exceeds two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) and the total of such contracts awarded to the same person in a given
year does not exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500), such contract
may be entered into, provided that the interested official has less than a
seven and one-half percent ownership interest in the business.
         C.   If the amount of the contract exceeds one thousand five hundred
dollars ($1,500) and the annual aggregate of such contracts awarded to the same
person is less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), such contract may
be entered into, provided that the interested official has less than a seven
and one-half percent ownership interest in the business and the contract is
awarded, after sealed bids, to the lowest responsible bidder.
         D.   If the contract is for the procurement of public utility
services, such contract does not constitute a conflict of interest, provided
that the interested official does not own more than a seven and one-half
percent ownership interest in the public utility company.
         E.   In each of the instances cited in paragraphs (b)(2)A. through (b)
(2)D. hereof, the interested official must disclose the nature and extent of
his or her interest, he or she must abstain from voting on the award of the
contract and the award of the contract must be approved by a majority vote of
the Board of Trustees.
      (3)   The Village may deposit funds in a bank in which a member of the
corporate authorities has an interest, provided that his or her ownership
interest in the bank does not exceed five percent of the aggregate ownership.
      (4)   No elected or appointed official shall accept any compensation for
the performance of his or her official duties other than that provided to him
or her by the Village.
      (5)   Every elected or appointed official shall file a financial
statement on or before April 15 of each year hereafter disclosing his or her
investments and interests in real property located in the Village or within the
one and one-half mile planning perimeter. Such statement shall be filed on a
form prescribed by the Village Clerk and shall be available for public
inspection. Such statement shall include information regarding any investment
or interest in any parcel of real estate, except the personal residence of the
elected or appointed official, and should include a statement of any economic
interest should there be any doubt on the part of the elected or appointed
official that the holding of such economic interest creates a conflict of
interest with his or her Municipal duties and responsibilities. Such official
shall file a copy of his or her statement of economic interest with the Clerk
within thirty days after he or she is required to file such statement with the
County Clerk as required by law.
(1976 Code § 2-77; Ord. 507. Passed 9-26-77.)
   (c)   Rules of Conduct.
      (1)   No member of the corporate authorities may solicit, accept or agree
to accept, gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality or services
under circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that a major
purpose of the donor is to influence the member in the performance of his or
her official duties. This provision does not apply to:
         A.   Any political contribution, in cash or in kind, if such
contribution is used for political purposes;
         B.   Any promotional contribution which would benefit the community;
         C.   The purchase of tickets or advertisements for political,
testimonial or goodwill dinners; or
         D.   A commercial reasonable loan made in the ordinary course of
business.
      (2)   No elected or appointed official shall accept any economic
opportunity, under circumstances where he or she knows that there is a
substantial possibility that the opportunity is being afforded to him or her
with the intent to influence his or her conduct in the performance of his or
her official duties.
      (3)   No elected or appointed official shall charge to or accept, from a
person known to have a legislative interest, a price, fee, compensation or
other consideration for the sale or lease of any property, or for the
furnishing of services, which is substantially in excess of that which the
legislator would charge in the ordinary course of business.
      (4)   No elected or appointed official, in order to further his or her
own economic interests, or those of any other person, shall disclose or use
confidential information acquired in the course of his or her official duties.
      (5)   No elected or appointed official shall receive compensation as an
elected or appointed official of any other unit of government in the State
without first obtaining the consent of the corporate authorities.
      (6)   No elected or appointed official may engage in other conduct which
is unbecoming to a public servant or which constitutes a breach of public
trust.
(1976 Code § 2-78; Ord. 507. Passed 9-26-77.)
   (d)   Ethical Principles.
      (1)   Where feasible, and taking into account the fact that legislative
service is part-time, an elected or appointed official should avoid accepting
or retaining an economic opportunity which presents a substantial threat to his
or her independence of judgment.
      (2)   When a member of the corporate authorities takes official action on
a legislative matter as to which he or she has a conflict situation created by
a personal, family or client legislative interest, he or she should consider
the possibility of eliminating the interest creating the conflict situation. If
that is not feasible, he or she should consider the possibility of abstaining
from such official action. In making his or her decision as to abstention, the
following factors should be considered:
         A.   Whether a substantial threat to his or her independence of
judgment is created by the conflict situation;
         B.   The effect of his or her participation on public confidence in
the integrity of the Village government;
         C.   Whether his or her participation is likely to have a significant
effect on the disposition of the matter; and
         D.   The need for his or her particular contribution, such as special
knowledge of the subject matter, to the effective functioning of the Village
government.
         He or she need not abstain if he or she decides to participate in a
manner contrary to the economic interest which creates the conflict situation.
         If he or she does abstain, he or she shall disclose that fact to the
Board of Trustees.

256.29 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   (a)   Intent. It is the policy of the Village to preserve, protect and
enhance the dignity of all Village personnel and to provide a professional work
environment free from sexual intimidation, ridicule, insult and overtones
perpetrated upon or by any employee.
   (b)   Application of Policy. This Policy prohibiting sexual harassment
applies to all officers and employees of the Village, including, but not
limited to, full-time and part-time employees, permanent and temporary
employees, employees covered under Fire and Police Commission rules, and
elected and appointed officials.
   (c)   Sexual Harassment Defined. Sexual harassment is behavior with sexual
content or overtones that is unwelcome and personally offensive. For the
purposes of this Policy, "sexual harassment" means unwelcome sexual advances,
direct or implied requests for sexual favors, and other verbal and/or physical
conduct of a sexual nature:
      (1)   When submission to such conduct is made, explicitly or implicitly,
a term or condition of an individual's employment, evaluation, advancement or
promotion;
      (2)   When submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis, or any part of the basis, affecting such individual's
career, job or employment conditions; or
      (3)   When such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an
individual's performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive
working environment.
   (d)   Prohibited Conduct.
      (1)   Sexual harassment includes conduct directed by men toward women, by
women toward men, by women toward women and by men toward men. Sexual
harassment consists of, but is not limited to, the following:

or suggestions about another employee's gender or sexuality; threats relating
to sexual conduct; repeated unwelcome requests for dates; statements of a
sexual nature about other employees; obscene or lewd sexual comments; using
slang names or labels that can be considered derogatory or too familiar, such
as "honey," "sweetie," "dear," "darling," "boy," "girl" or other terms people
may find offensive; or talking about or calling attention to an employee's body
or characteristics in a sexually negative or embarrassing way.
         B.   Nonverbal behavior: sexually suggestive looks; sexually
suggestive or insulting sounds, such as whistles, catcalls or smacking or
kissing noises; or obscene or sexually suggestive bodily gestures.
         C.   Physical behavior: unwelcome physical contact, such as pats,
squeezes, hugs, kissing, pinching, purposeful rubbing against another person's
body or actual sexual assault or abuse;
         D.   Visual behavior: displaying pictures, cartoons, posters, pinups,
calendars, signs, etc., of a nude or of a sexual nature.
         E.   Other behavior, including, but not limited to, laughing at,
ignoring or not taking seriously an employee who experiences sexual harassment;
blaming the victim of sexual harassment for causing the problems; continuing
the offensive behavior after a co-worker has expressed objection to the
behavior; retaliating against an employee who rejects sexual advances by
denying promotions or other job related benefits; gossiping about or ridiculing
a victim or alleged harasser with respect to the alleged harassment; demanding
or requesting sexual favors tied to promises of better treatment or threats
concerning employment; discriminating against an employee for refusing to give
in to demands or requests for sexual favors; or rewarding or granting favors to
one who submits to demands or requests for sexual favors.
      (2)   No employee shall, directly or indirectly:
         A.   Threaten or insinuate that another employee's refusal to submit
to sexual advances will adversely affect that employee's relationship with the
Village, work status evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties or any
other condition of employment;
         B.   Promise, imply or grant preferential treatment in connection with
another employee engaging in sexual conduct; or
         C.   Abuse the dignity of another employee through insulting or
degrading sexual remarks or conduct.
   (e)   Reporting of Alleged Violations. An employee alleging a violation of
this Policy should report, as quickly as possible, in confidence, such
complaints. Such allegations may be brought to the attention of an immediate
supervisor, the Assistant Village Manager, the Village Manager or the Village
President. Persons receiving such complaints shall secure, in written form, the
following information:
      (1)   The name, department and position of the complainant;
      (2)   The name(s) of the person(s) alleged to be in violation of this
Policy, if known;
      (3)   The specific action or series of acts or actions constituting the
behavior alleged to be sexual harassment, including, but not limited to:
         A.   The length of time that such behavior has transpired.
         B.   The implied or actual employment action (i.e. failure to promote,
job assignments, refusal to hire, etc.) that may have occurred.
   (NOTE: Sexual harassment does not necessarily have to be linked to the grant
or denial of an economic quid pro quo. Sexual harassment leading to a
noneconomic injury is also prohibited.)
      (4)   The names of any witnesses or others with knowledge of such
behavior.
   Every effort will be made to promptly investigate any allegation of sexual
harassment in as confidential a manner as possible.
   (f)   Investigation of Alleged Violations; Determinations; Disciplinary
Action.
      (1)   The Village Manager or his or her designated agent shall
investigate complaints alleging violations of this Policy, except in an

be searched by the Secretary of State for the purpose of obtaining the required
ownership information.
   The Chief shall cause the stolen motor vehicle files of the State Police to

information determined from these record searches shall be returned to the
Chief for his or her use in sending a notification by certified mail to the

   In those instances where the certified notification specified in Section
418.06 of this Traffic Code and Section 4-206 of the Illinois Vehicle Code is

the Village, or another governmental agency desiring the same, or it may be
removed and dismantled.
(1976 Code § 22-24.)

restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation, or if the eligible
vehicle is parked or left in violation of any provision of this chapter or
other applicable chapters concerning obstruction of traffic, access to or
egress from driveways, alleys, fire lanes, hydrants or stations, or in any
place where it constitutes an obstruction or a hazard, or where it impedes
workers during such operations as snow removal, the Chief of Police may cause
the eligible vehicle to be towed to a vehicle pound or be relocated to a legal
parking place and there restrained.
   (b)   Immobilization List; Accumulated Citations. A vehicle shall be
eligible for immobilization as provided herein anytime after inclusion of its
State registration number on an immobilization list. A vehicle State
registration number shall be included on an immobilization list only if:
      (1)   The registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated five or more
parking citations in the Village on which no payment has been made or
appearance filed within the time specified by the citations;
      (2)   At least twenty-one days prior to placing the registration plate
number of the vehicle on the immobilization eligibility list, notice of
impending vehicle immobilization has been sent to the registered owner, first
class mail, postage pre-paid, at the address of the registered owner recorded
with the Secretary of State or, in the case of a vehicle bearing a registration
number of a State other than Illinois, at the address of the registered owner
recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles.
   (c)   Notice Requirements. The notice required in subsection (b) hereof
shall state the name and address of the registered owner, the state
registration number of the vehicle, the nature of the ordinances violated and
the numbers and issue dates of the outstanding citations. The notice shall also
advise that a person may challenge the validity of notice of impending vehicle
immobilization by appearing in person and submitting evidence which would
conclusively disprove liability, such as the following:
      (1)   That the person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the
date or dates the citations were issued;
      (2)   That the fines or penalties for the violations cited in the report
were paid; or
      (3)   That the registered owner has not accumulated five or more parking
citations which were unpaid, or not adjudicated, or for which no appearance has
been filed.
   (d)   Notice of Liability for Damage to Restraint.
      (1)   Upon immobilization of an eligible vehicle, a notice shall be
affixed to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Such notice shall warn that the
vehicle is immobilized and that any attempt to move the vehicle may result in
its damage.
      (2)   The notice shall also state that the unauthorized removal of or
damage to the immobilizing restraint is a violation of 720 ILCS 5/16-1 and 5/
21. The notice shall also provide information specifying how release of the
immobilizing restraint may be had and how the registered owner may obtain an
immobilization hearing pursuant to this section.
   (e)   Towing and Impoundment. Except where the vehicle is otherwise subject
to towing, if the immobilizing restraint has not been released within seventy-
two hours of its placement, the restraint shall be released and the vehicle
towed and impounded. Within ten days after a vehicle has been impounded, a
notice of impoundment shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the registered owner of the vehicle at the address to which the
notice was mailed. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to a
post-immobilization and post-towing hearing, and that if the car is not claimed
within thirty days from the date of the notice, the vehicle may be sold or
otherwise disposed of in accordance with this chapter.
   (f)   Hearings. The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall have the right to
a hearing to determine whether the immobilization or any subsequent towing was
erroneous or whether the vehicle was property included on an immobilization
list, if the owner files a written demand for a hearing with the Village within
fourteen days after issuance of the notice specified in subsection (e) hereof
or within fourteen days of the immobilization, whichever is later. A hearing
shall be conducted within forty-eight hours of receipt of a written demand for
the same unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties. Failure to request
or attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a
hearing. In the event of such failure, any amount deposited pursuant to
subsection (g) hereof shall be forfeited. A hearing provided by this section
shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or
notice of parking violation issued relative to the immobilized vehicle.
   (g)   Release of an Immobilized Vehicle. Prior to a hearing on the validity
of the immobilization, as provided in subsection (f) hereof, the owner of an
immobilized vehicle or other authorized person shall be permitted to secure
release of the vehicle by:
      (1)   Paying the immobilization, towing and storage fees, if applicable;
and
      (2)   Paying all the fines and penalties, if any, on the outstanding
complaints specified in the notice of impending vehicle immobilization, or
arranging for the payment as approved by the Chief of Police.
   The fee for immobilization shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). The fee
for towing subsequent to immobilization shall be two hundred and fifty dollars
($250.00). The storage fee shall be set by the towing company at an amount not
to exceed what is allowed by state law. However, no fees shall be assessed for
any immobilization or tow which has been determined to be erroneous.
   (h)   Unauthorized Removal of Immobilization Device. No person shall
relocate or tow any vehicle restrained by an immobilizing device without the
approval of the Chief of Police or his designee.
   (i)   Suspension of Driving Privileges. Pursuant to the provisions of 625
ILCS 5/6- 306.5, the Secretary of State shall be provided a certified report
indicating that:
      (1)   The registered owner or lessee of the vehicle has accumulated ten
or more parking citations in the Village on which no payment has been made or
appearance filed within the time specified by the citations and therefore
requesting suspension of the registered owner's or lessee's driving privileges.
      (2)   Any person whose license is suspended pursuant to this section and
State statute may challenge the accuracy of the certified report submitted to
the Secretary of State by the Village. The challenge shall be heard by an
individual to be designated by the Village President. The grounds for the
challenge shall be limited to the following issues:
         A.   Whether the person was the owner or lessee of the vehicle or
vehicles receiving ten or more parking violation notices on the date or dates
such notices were issued; and
         B.   Whether the person has already paid the fine or penalty for the
ten or more violations indicated on the certified report.

456.03 RED LIGHT VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Violation. The registered owner of record of a vehicle is liable for a
violation of this Chapter when the vehicle is recorded by an automatic traffic
law enforcement system as being operated in a manner that constitutes
disregarding a traffic control device or committing a "no turn on red"
violation. A photographic recording of the violation obtained by an automatic
traffic law enforcement system shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of
this Chapter. It shall be a defense to a violation if:
      (1)   The operator of the vehicle was issued a uniform traffic citation
for a violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-306.
      (2)   The violation occurred at a time during which the vehicle or its
state registration plates of the motor vehicle were reported to a law
enforcement agency as having been stolen and the vehicle or its plates had not
been recovered by the owner at the time of the alleged violation; or

designee, the correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle identified
in the Notice of Violation at the time of the violation, together with a copy
of the lease agreement and any additional information as may be required by the
Traffic Compliance Administrator. Where the lessor complies with the provisions
of this subsection, the lessee of the vehicle shall be deemed to be the

authorized designee, that, based on inspection of recorded images generated by
the system, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-
208.6 or this Chapter. All determinations by a technician, or his/her
authorized designated that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of
625 ILCS 5/11-208.6 or this Chapter must be reviewed and approved by a Village
police officer or a retired police officer of the Village.
(Ord. 1323. Passed 8-27-07; Ord. 1651. Passed 10-9-17.)

Compliance Administrator, or his/her authorized designee, determines that a
motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section
456.03 of this Chapter, the Traffic Compliance Administrator, or his/her
authorized designee, shall issue or cause to be issued a written Notice of

designee, shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered in the
violation notice by signing his/her name to the notice at the time of service,

456.06 HEARING.
   (a)   The owner of a vehicle who is sent a Notice of Violation may elect to
contest the Notice of Violation at an administrative hearing. If the owner of
the vehicle is not a resident of the Village, then the owner of the vehicle
shall have the alternative of requesting that the hearing be conducted by mail
as provided in Section
412.09 of the Codified Ordinances; except, however, the statement of facts
provided by the owner of the vehicle in support of his/her defense need not be
notarized. If a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be conducted on the
date, time and location provided in the Notice of Violation.
   (b)   The hearing shall be limited to determining whether the Notice of
Violation, including the recorded images together with any other evidence that
may be presented at the hearing support a determination that:
      (1)   The operator of the vehicle was issued a uniform traffic citation
for a violation of 625 ILCS 5/11-306.
      (2)   The violation occurred at the time during which the vehicle or its
state registration plates of the motor vehicle were reported to a law
enforcement agency as having been stolen and the vehicle or its registration
plates had not been recovered by the owner at the time of the alleged

the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle identified in the Notice of
Violation at the time of the violation.

Violation and shall be admissible in any hearing held to consider a charge that
there was a violation of Section
456.03(a) of this Chapter, subject to rebuttal on the basis of evidence
showing:
      (1)   The existence of one of the defenses set forth in Section

fine.
   (e)   If the person identified as the registered owner of a vehicle in a
Notice of Violation issued pursuant to Section
456.05 of this Chapter is not a resident of the Village, then such person may
contest the charges in the Notice of Violation using the grounds set forth in
Section
456.06(b) of this Chapter. In lieu of attending the administrative hearing in
person, the registered owner may, no later than the response date specified in
the Notice of Violation, submit any and all documentation or other materials to
the Traffic Compliance Administrator by mail. The Traffic Compliance
Administrator, or his/her authorized designee, shall forward all timely-
submitted documentary and other materials to the Hearing Officer for review and
determination. The records of the Secretary of State shall be prima facie
evidence as to whether the registered owner is a resident of the Village.

606.07 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   All buildings and premises subject to this chapter are subject to
inspection from time to time by the Health Officer or the Village Manager or
his or her designee.
   (b)   All rooms and areas in the building shall be available and accessible
for such inspection which shall be made during usual business hours if the
premises are used for nonresidential purposes. However, inspections may be made
at other times if:
      (1)   The premises are not available for inspection during such usual
business hours;
      (2)   There is reason to believe that violations are occurring on the
premises which can only be apprehended and proved by inspection during other
than the prescribed hours.
      (3)   There is reason to believe a violation exists of a character which
is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring inspection and abatement
without delay.
   (c)   Emergency inspections may be authorized without warrant if the Health
Officer or the Manager or his or her designee has reason to believe that a
condition exists which poses an immediate threat to life, health or safety.
Such procedure shall take place only where the time required to apply for and
secure the issuance of a warrant would render ineffective the immediate action
necessary to abate the condition.
   (d)   Emergency inspections may also be authorized in times of air pollution
emergencies as provided by law. Where the Health Officer, the Manager or his or
her designee is refused entry or access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by
the owner, occupant or operator from conducting an inspection of the premises,
such owner, occupant or operator shall be in violation of this chapter and
subject to the penalty set forth in Section 606.99.
(1976 Code 16-8.)
606.08 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   (a)   The Health Officer or the Village Manager or his or her designee may,
upon affidavit, apply to the judge of competent jurisdiction for a search
warrant setting forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances that
provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or a violation of any
of the provisions of this chapter may exist on the premises, including one or
more of the following:
      (1)   That the premises require inspection according to the cycle
established by the Health Officer or the Manager or his or her designee for
periodic inspections of premises of the type involved;
      (2)   That observation of external conditions (e.g. smoke, ash, soot,
odors) of the premises and its public areas has resulted in the belief that
violations of this chapter exist; or
      (3)   That circumstances such as age and design of fuel-burning equipment
and/or system, types of incinerator and particular use of premises render
systematic inspections of such buildings necessary in the interest of public
health and safety.
   (b)   If the judge of competent jurisdiction is satisfied as to the matters
set forth in the affidavit, he or she shall authorize the issuance of a search
warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of the premises on
which the nuisance or violation may exist.
(1976 Code 16-9.)
606.09 INTERPRETATION.
   This chapter shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes herein
described. Nothing herein is to be construed as repealing or abridging the
emergency powers of any agency of government except to the extent expressly set
forth therein. (1976 Code 16-10.)

Manager within seven days after the owner received notice of the vicious dog
declaration. In the event that the owner fails to file a written request for a
hearing within the requisite seven-day period, or fails to appear at a
scheduled hearing, the owner will be deemed to have waived the right to a

the owner may be required to present proof of insurance demonstrating that the
owner is maintaining said insurance.

the Village Manager or the Police Department immediately upon learning that the
vicious animal is unconfined or on the loose, or if the dog has attacked a
human being or domestic animal.

gives away or otherwise transfers custody or ownership of the vicious animal,
the owner shall, within three days of the sale or transfer, provide the Village
Manager or Police Department with the name, address and telephone number of the
vicious dog’s new owner or custodian. The owner shall notify the new owner or
custodian of the animal’s designation as a vicious dog . If the new owner or
custodian resides or keeps the animal within the corporate limits of the

the Complete Streets policy.
   (a)   The Village shall undertake the following process for implementing the
Complete Streets policy:
      (1)   Develop a multi-modal transportation plan.
      (2)   Establish a checklist of pedestrian, bicycle and transit
accommodations such as accessible sidewalk curb ramps, crosswalks, countdown
pedestrian signals, signs, median refuges, curb extensions, pedestrian scale
lighting, bike lanes, shoulders and bus shelters, with the presumption they
shall be included in each project unless supporting documentation against
inclusion is provided and is found to be justifiable.
      (3)   Establish a procedure to evaluate resurfacing projects for complete
streets inclusion according to the length of the project, local support,
environmental constraints, total available right-of-way, funding resources, and
bicycle and/or pedestrian compatibility.

and other relevant guidelines. Methods for providing flexibility within safe
design parameters, such as context sensitive solutions and designs, will also
be considered.
      (5)   Implementation of regular training for existing and new Village
engineers, planners and elected officials on bicycle/pedestrian/transit
policies and the integration of non-motorized travel options into
transportation systems.
      (6)   Update of all relevant and appropriate codes, standards, and
ordinances to ensure the design components for all modified streets meet the
intent of this policy.
      (7)   Identification of all current and potential future sources of
funding for street improvements.
      (8)   Establishment of performance measures to gauge the success of the
Complete Streets policy.
   (b)   Through the implementation of the above outlined process, the Village
will:
      (1)   Create a comprehensive, integrated, connected multi-modal network
by providing connections to biking and walking trip generators such as
employment, education, residential, recreational and public facilities, as well
as retail and transit centers.
      (2)   Provide safe and accessible accommodations for existing and future
pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities.
      (3)   Address the need for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross corridors
as well as travel along them. Even where bicyclists and pedestrians may not
commonly use a particular travel corridor that is being improved or
constructed, they will need to be able to cross such corridor safely and
conveniently. Therefore, the design of intersections shall accommodate
bicyclists and pedestrians in a manner that is safe, accessible and convenient.
      (4)   Research, develop and support best practices in improving safety
and mobility.
      (5)   Consider connections for safe routes to schools, trail crossings,
and areas or population groups with limited transportation options.
      (6)   Comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

temporary relief, pending final determination of the proceedings under this

free and uninterrupted passage of vehicles, traffic or pedestrians; or
      (2)   Commit, in or upon any public street, highway, sidewalk or any
other public place or building, any act or thing which is an obstruction or
interference to the free and uninterrupted use of property or with any business
lawfully conducted by anyone in or upon or facing or fronting on any such
public street, highway, sidewalk or any other public place or building, all of
which prevents the free and uninterrupted ingress, egress and regress therein,
thereon and thereto.
(1976 Code § 12-16.)
   (b)   No person shall loiter on quasipublic portions of private property, or
institutional property of a public nature, such as schools, churches, etc., and

does not apply to participation in a recognized athletic activity, facilities
for which are provided by the institutional proprietor.
(Ord. 588. Passed 6-14-82.)
   (c)   When a person causes or commits any of the conditions set forth in
subsections (a) and (b) hereof a police officer or other law enforcement

be guilty of a violation of this section.
   (d)   A person is also in violation of this section if he or she loiters or

individuals under circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or
property in the vicinity.

whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the actor takes flight upon
the appearance of a peace officer, refuses to identify himself or herself or
manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.
      (2)   Unless flight by the actor or another circumstance makes it
impractical, a peace officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under
this subsection, afford the actor an opportunity to dispel any alarm which
would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him or her to identify himself or
herself and explain his or her presence and conduct.
      (3)   No person shall be convicted of an offense under this subsection if
the peace officer did not afford the actor such opportunity or if it appears,
at trial, that the explanation given by the actor was true and, if believed by
the peace officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm.

to carry on the same business or occupation at the place named in such new

corporation to accept the franchise as provided herein shall cause the

(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)

franchise granted pursuant to this chapter should be renewed or extended, if
the grantee applies to the Board at least nine months prior to the expiration
of the franchise agreement or any renewal thereof. Failure to make such a
timely application may be cause for the forfeiture of renewal rights.
   (b)   Conditions. The grantee's renewal application, when filed, shall
demonstrate:
      (1)   That the grantee has been and continues to be in substantial
compliance with this chapter and the franchise agreement;

high quality service; and

findings, issue a report within ninety days of the public hearing, that it:
      (3)   Has found that the public interest is no longer served by the
continuation of the system's communications services in the Village, and
therefore has decided that such services should not be enfranchised in the
Village during the year succeeding the date of the grantee's termination of
service;
      (4)   Has found that the grantee has substantially failed to meet the
criteria for renewal established in subsection (b) hereof, and therefore has
decided that the grantee's renewal application may be denied; or
      (5)   Has found that the grantee has substantially met the criteria
established in subsection (b) hereof, except where prevented by conditions
beyond its reasonable control, and therefore has decided that the franchise may
be renewed.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)

   The grantee is obliged and entitled to continue to operate its system under

(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.10 REVOCATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   In addition to any rights set out elsewhere in this chapter, the
grantor reserves the right to revoke the franchise, and all rights and
privileges pertaining thereto, as provided in this section.
   (b)   The franchise may be revoked if the grantee:
      (1)   Willfully or repeatedly refuses, neglects or fails to construct,
operate or maintain its cable television system in accordance with this chapter
and the franchise;
      (2)   Willfully or repeatedly refuses, neglects or fails to comply with
the conditions of occupancy of any public land;
      (3)   Delays the system's construction schedule for more than eighteen
months;
      (4)   Willfully or repeatedly refuses, neglects or fails to make required
extensions of service;
      (5)   Practices any fraud or deceit upon the Village or the system's
subscribers;
      (6)   Becomes insolvent, is unable or unwilling to pay its debts, is
adjudged bankrupt or seeks relief under the bankruptcy laws; or
      (7)   In any other way substantially violates or fails to comply with any
of the provisions of this chapter, the franchise or any rule or regulation
adopted thereunder.
   (c)   If the Board of Trustees determines that grounds for revocation exist
or have existed, the Board shall notify the grantee, in writing, setting forth
the nature and facts of the alleged violation or noncompliance. If, within
sixty days following such written notification, the grantee has not furnished
reasonable evidence that corrective action has been initiated, taken or is
being actively and expeditiously pursued, that the alleged violation or
noncompliance did not occur or that the alleged violation or noncompliance was
beyond the grantee's control, then the matter will be referred to the Board for
further determination.
   (d)   Upon the failure of the grantee to comply with the provisions of the
franchise or to commence appropriate corrective action within sixty days after
receiving written notice by certified mail to the general manager, or agent, of
the grantee of such noncompliance from the grantor, the grantor may hold a
public hearing to consider the option of revocation of the franchise. The
grantor shall give the grantee at least twenty days advance written notice of
such hearing and shall also publish such notice in advance in a newspaper with
local circulation. If, after such hearing, at which the grantee will be
afforded all due process of law, including the right to appear and be heard,
the grantor determines that the franchise should be revoked, the grantor must
advise the grantee of its decision in writing and may, by ordinance, declare a
forfeiture, whereupon all rights of the holders of the franchise shall
immediately be divested without a further act upon the part of the grantor. The
Board may require the grantee to remove its visible structures or property from
all public ways and restore the streets to such condition as the grantor may
reasonably require. Upon failure to do so, the grantor may perform the work and
collect the cost thereof from the grantee. The cost thereof shall be a lien
upon all property of the grantee located within the franchise area. Such lien
shall not attach to property of the grantee located on the poles or other
utilities until such property has been removed therefrom.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.11 GRANTEE'S OBLIGATION AS TRUSTEE.
   (a)   At all times from the expiration or revocation of a franchise and
until either a grantee transfers to the Village or other succeeding operator of
the system all of its rights, title and interest to all assets, real and
personal, related to its cable television system, or the Village's right to
either acquire or assign its rights to acquire any of the grantee's assets
expires without the Village having exercised such a right, whichever occurs
first, the grantee shall have a duty to such successor as a trustee holding
such assets for the benefit of such successor, and the grantee shall not sell
any of the system assets or make any physical, material or administrative
operational changes that would tend to degrade the quality of service to the
subscribers, decrease gross revenues or materially increase expenses, without
the express permission, in writing, of the Village or its assigns. The grantee
shall at all times operate the system in accordance with this chapter and the
franchise as if the franchise had not expired or had not been revoked.
   (b)   In the event of the expiration or revocation of a franchise, this
section shall not be construed to give a grantee any vested or other franchise
right, but the right of the grantee in such circumstances shall exist only on a
day-to-day basis until the transfer is effected.
   (c)   For its management services during the interim period as a trustee,
the grantee shall receive, as compensation, the net profit generated during the
period between the expiration or revocation of the franchise, as the case may
be, and the transfer of the grantee's assets to the Village or the successor.
   (d)   Further, this section shall in no way limit the power of the Village,
upon expiration or revocation of a franchise, to require the grantee to cease
all operations whatsoever and/or remove its facilities, or to otherwise
exercise any rights the Village would otherwise have.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.12 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   As consideration for a franchise granted under this chapter, the
grantee shall pay to the Village an amount equal to three percent of the
grantee's gross revenues. However, as the Village is interested in actively
creating local programming and is therefore desirous of generating additional
revenues, the grantee agrees that it will immediately assist and cooperate with
the Village in an application to the Federal Communications Commission to
increase such franchise fee to five percent of the grantee's gross revenues.
   (b)   If the law, in the future, permits some larger basis for computing
such fee, the Board of Trustees shall, at its election, be entitled to collect
such additional moneys upon sixty days prior written notice to the grantee,
provided that upon receipt of such notice, the grantee shall be entitled to
initiate a petition for an equivalent rate increase pursuant to Section
814.32(c), notwithstanding any other then pending or recently decided rate
requests. In such event, the Board shall afford the rate increase petition a
presumption of reasonableness and shall stay the effective date of the new fee
until sixty days after its decision on the rate petition.
   (c)   The Board anticipates that franchise fees would be utilized to defray
the expense of local regulation of the grantee, to support the development of
the access channels and generally to encourage development of the system.
   (d)   Payments due under this section shall be payable thirty days after the
end of each calendar quarter. Each such payment shall be accompanied by a
report, certified by an officer of the grantee, showing the basis for the
computation thereof.
   (e)   The Board may, at its option, elect to receive from the grantee a lump
sum advance on the payments to be made under this section at any time within
three years from the date of the franchise award upon request by the grantor to
the cumulative limit of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Such payment
shall be credited to the grantee, and the grantee shall not be required to make
the quarterly payments until the credit has been eliminated. At that time, the
grantee shall be obliged to continue making quarterly payments as required by
this section.
   (f)   No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the
amount paid is in fact the correct amount, and all amounts paid shall be
subject to audit and recomputation by the Village for eighteen months after
receipt thereof. In the event that such recomputation results in additional
fees owed, such amount shall be subject to an interest charge at the current
prime lending rate from the date the payment was due.
   (g)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as relieving the grantee
of its liability for other properly applicable local taxes.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82; Ord. 598. Passed 8-23-82.)
814.13 ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF FRANCHISE.

required prior to the assignment or transfer of the franchise. If the franchise
is transferred, the Village reserves the right to renegotiate any and all
portions of the franchise agreement.
   (b)   Notification of the Board is required where ownership or control of
more than twenty percent of the right of control of the grantee is acquired in
any transaction or series of transactions by a person or group of persons
acting in concert, none of whom already owns or controls twenty percent or more
of such right of control, singularly or collectively. By its acceptance of this
franchise, the grantee specifically grants and agrees that the occurrence of
any such acquisition without prior notification of the Board will constitute a
violation of this chapter by the grantee.
   (c)   The sale, transfer, lease or trust mortgage of, or any other
instrument of hypothecation regarding, the franchise shall not constitute a
waiver or release of any of the rights of the Village under this chapter and
the franchise.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the grantee may
assign, transfer, sell or dispose of, in whole or in part, by voluntary sale,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or the cable television
system to a wholly owned subsidiary or an affiliated interest without the prior
consent of the Board, provided that the parent company remains fully liable for
the provisions of the franchise agreement and the Village is timely notified of
the time and circumstance of such transaction.
   (e)   The grantor's right to assign a franchise shall not limit the right of
the Village to assign its rights to acquire all of the assets of a grantee's
cable television system.

his or her agents upon public ways to ensure compliance with this chapter. If
such an inspection reveals that the grantee has failed, in the Village's
judgment, to fulfill its obligations under this chapter, the Village shall
notify the grantee, in writing, of its specific deficiencies. If the grantee
has not commenced the needed corrective action within forty-eight hours of
receipt of such notification, the Village, at the direction of the Board of
Trustees, may undertake the necessary repairs for restoration at the grantee's
sole expense under Section
814.35.

caused by conditions which are beyond the grantee's reasonable control or which
are not reasonably foreseeable. In imposing this penalty, the Board shall
comply with the provisions of Section
814.50.
   In addition, if the Village has reasonable evidence to support a belief that
the service provided fails to meet the performance standards, it may require
the grantee to test twenty subscribers. If the service of more than ten percent
of such subscribers fails to meet performance standards, the grantee shall be
required to indicate what corrective measures have been taken, and the entire
test shall be repeated for at least twenty different locations, of which at
least eight locations, as the Village may direct, shall be at the far ends of
the distribution of the main trunk line. If a second test results in failure of
more than ten percent, the Board may, at its sole option, reduce subscriber
rates due to degraded service, unless the circumstances of the failure are
caused by conditions which are beyond the grantee's reasonable control or which
are not reasonably foreseeable. In imposing this penalty, the Board shall
comply with the provisions of Section
814.50.
(Ord. 598. Passed 8-23-82.)
814.315 COMPLIANCE WITH FCC REGULATIONS RE SERVICE RATES.
   The Village shall follow all FCC regulations in the administration of basic
service tier rates.
(Res. R-7-94. Passed 2-14-94.)
814.32 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (a)   Initial Rates for Basic Service.
      (1)   The grantee shall establish initial rates for the subscriber
services indicated in Attachment B, which is attached to original Ordinance
593, passed July 12, 1982. The grantee shall not increase the initial rates for
a period of twenty-four months after system activation or thirty-six months
from the date of the franchise award, whichever is longer. The maintenance of
initial rates shall include pay television rates, and the grantee shall not
utilize Federal Communications Commission or other pre-emption of pay cable
rates to increase such rates prior to the expiration of such period. Upon the
expiration of the initial period, rates and charges for those services for
which rate regulations are not pre-empted by the Federal Communications
Commission shall be subject to regulation by the grantor.
      (2)   The grantee may add to its service or installation fees any
Federal, State or local tax or fee directly imposed on subscribers or any
additional copyright fee that may be imposed as a result of legislative or
judicial action at the Federal, State or local level taken after the filing of
the franchise application. If, during the term of the franchise, the grantee
receives a refund of any copyright payment caused by an error in copyright fee
computations which results in an overcharge to subscribers, the grantee shall,
without delay, notify the Board of Trustees, suggest a plan for flow-through of
the refund to its subscribers and retain such refund in an interest-bearing
escrow account pending an order of the Board. After considering the plan
submitted by the grantee, the Board shall order flow-through of the refund with
accrued interest to the grantee's subscribers in a fair and equitable manner.
   (b)   Rate Regulation. The grantor may consider any or all of the following
factors in determining whether to approve, modify or disapprove the grantee's
requests for rate increases during the term of the franchise:
      (1)   The grantee's substantial fulfillment of all material requirements
of the franchise;
      (2)   The quality of service, as indicated by the number and type of
service complaints, the grantee's response to complaints and the results of
periodic system performance tests;
      (3)   Prevailing rates for comparable services in other cable systems of
similar size and complexity;
      (4)   The rate of return on the grantee's financial investment and
equity, as compared to businesses of equivalent risk. The rate of return shall
be calculated on a cumulative basis for all system revenues and costs,
including services such as pay television that may be exempt from local rate
regulation. The grantor may request from the grantee all information as shall
reasonably be necessary to determine system revenues and costs.
      (5)   The performance of the grantee in introducing new services and
expanding the cable system's capability, as compared to other systems of
similar size and complexity.
   (c)   Rate Changes. The grantee shall not request increases in rates for
basic service more often than annually. Upon receipt of a rate increase
request, the grantor may schedule a public hearing prior to arriving at a
decision. The grantor may request relevant financial and other information
necessary to determine the justification for the requested increase. Within
ninety days after receipt of the rate increase request, the grantor may, by
resolution, approve the request in full, approve the request in part or
disapprove the request. In any event, the grantor shall provide findings as to
the basis for its decision. If no grantor action has occurred within ninety
days after receipt of the rate increase request, the request shall be deemed to
have been approved.
   (d)   Rates for Other Than Basic Service. At least ninety days in advance of
the offering of any service or equipment other than basic subscriber service,
the grantee shall file with the Board of Trustees a schedule of the rates and
charges and the rules relating to such other service and equipment and shall
not alter the same upon less than ninety days notice and only in accordance
with the then applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission and/or other agencies of competent jurisdiction. If, at any time,
applicable Federal or State law would permit Board regulation of the rates in
accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (c) hereof, such
regulation shall be authorized under this section.
   (e)   Rates to be Nondiscriminatory. The grantee shall administer any and
all rates and charges so as not to give preference to or discriminate among
subscribers of a like category or class. Nothing in this provision, however,
shall be deemed to prevent the grantee from establishing:
      (1)   Special temporary reduced rates for periodic promotional offers to
attract new subscribers or for subscribers who pay promptly;
      (2)   Reasonable policies for deposits, penalties or denial of service
where a particular subscriber has proven to be a bona fide credit problem;
      (3)   With the prior approval of the Board, special schedules of rates
and charges for service to premises in annexed areas not meeting the density
standards established in Section
814.26, provided that the same are not inconsistent with applicable Federal
Communications Commission rules and regulations; or
      (4)   Separate rates for commercial and noncommercial users of access
channels.
   (f)   No Charge for Certain Installations. Each public or private school
located in the Village shall be given, upon request, one free outlet and
subscription to the system's basic subscriber service. All Village-occupied
buildings shall receive, upon request, the same free service and maintenance as
schools, such buildings to include, but not be limited to, courts, correctional
systems, publicly-supported health facilities, public safety facilities,
publicly-supported day care centers and publicly-supported libraries.
Additional outlets and service shall be governed by the other rate provisions
of this chapter. In addition, the Village shall have the unrestricted use of
cable for Municipal security systems, traffic control systems or other
Municipal use deemed to be in the public interest. However, the Village shall
not offer services in direct competition with those offered by the grantee.
   (g)   Advance Charges and Deposits. The grantee may require subscribers to
pay for basic subscriber service one month in advance. No other advance payment
or deposit shall be required by the grantee for the basic subscriber service,
except as provided for in paragraph (e)(2) hereof. No deposit or advance
payment shall be charged for the provision of a basic converter without the
prior approval of the Board of Trustees.
   (h)   Disconnection and Reconnection. Except as otherwise provided by the
Board, there shall be no charge for the disconnection of any installation or
outlet. If a subscriber fails to pay a properly due monthly subscriber fee or
any other properly due fee or charge, the grantee may disconnect the
subscriber's service outlet. However, such disconnection shall not be effected
within thirty days after the due date of the delinquent fee or charge and shall
include ten days written notice of the intent to disconnect, properly mailed to
the subscriber in question. After disconnection, upon payment in full of the
delinquent fee or charge, any reasonable collection expense or penalty and the
reconnection charge, the grantee shall promptly reinstate the subscriber's
cable service.
   (i)   Changes in Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
the grantee shall be entitled to impose charges for downgrade in service or a
lateral change in service pursuant to this chapter so long as the charge
imposed does not exceed ten dollars ($10.00) for each downgrade in service or
lateral change in service. Downgrade or lateral service change charges shall
not be charged until after thirty days from the date of original installation
or, for existing installations, thirty days from the passage of this chapter.
   (j)   Refunds. If a subscriber terminates the basic subscriber service
during the first twelve months of the service because of the failure of the
grantee to render service in accordance with the standards set forth in Section
814.40, the grantee shall refund to such subscriber an amount equal to the
installation charges paid, if any, by the subscriber, multiplied by the
fraction derived by dividing, by twelve, the months remaining before the annual
anniversary of service.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82; Ord. 598. Passed 8-23-82; Ord. 642. Passed 5-14-84.)
814.33 GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   The grantee shall pay, and, within thirty days of the effective date
of the award of the franchise agreement, specifically agrees to pay, all
charges, damages and penalties which the Village may legally be required to pay
as a result of granting the franchise.
   (b)   The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify and hold
harmless the Village, its officials, boards, commissions, agents and employees
against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments
for damages arising out of the operation of the cable television system under
the franchise agreement. Such damages shall include, but not be limited to,
penalties arising out of copyright infringements and damages arising out of any
failure by the grantee to secure consent from the owners, authorized
distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's cable
television system, whether or not any act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise. Indemnified expenses shall
include, but are not limited to, all out-of-pocket expenses such as attorney's
fees, court costs and witness fees and shall also include the reasonable value
of any service rendered by assistants, agents or employees of the Village.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.34 LIABILITY INSURANCE AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   The grantee shall maintain, and, within thirty days of the effective
date of the award of the franchise agreement, specifically agrees to maintain,
throughout the term of the franchise, liability insurance insuring the Village
and the grantee throughout the life of the franchise as follows:
      (1)   Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) workers' compensation/
employers' liability coverage;
      (2)   One and one-half million dollars ($1,500,000) comprehensive general
liability/bodily injury coverage;
      (3)   Five hundred thousand dollars/one and one-half million dollars
($500,000/$1,500,000) property damage coverage;
      (4)   One million dollars/two million dollars ($1,000,000/2,000,000)
motor vehicle liability coverage; and
      (5)   One hundred percent builders' risk, fire and extended coverage.
   (b)   The grantee shall maintain and, within thirty days of the effective
date of the award of the franchise agreement, furnish proof of the posting of a
performance bond running to the Village with good and sufficient surety
approved by the Village in the amount specified in the franchise. If no amount
is specified therein, then the bond shall be five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000), conditioned upon the faithful performance and discharge of the
obligations imposed by this chapter and the franchise awarded hereunder from
the date thereof including, but not limited to, the faithful compliance with
the construction timetable proposed by the grantee in its application as
incorporated into the franchise, unless an appropriate extension thereof is
approved by the Board of Trustees. When regular subscriber service is available
to more than ninety percent of the occupied dwelling units within the franchise
area, the amount of the bond shall be reduced to one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000).
   (c)   The performance bond and all certificates of insurance policies
required in this section shall be in forms reasonably satisfactory to the
Village Attorney and shall require thirty days written notice to both the
Village and the grantee of any cancellation thereof. In the event of any such
cancellation notice, the grantee shall obtain, pay all premiums for and file
with the Village written evidence of the issuance of a replacement bond or
policy within thirty days following receipt by the Village or the grantee of
such notice of cancellation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the bond shall not
apply to damages proximately resulting from noncompliance with Section
814.28, for which separate penalty provisions are provided in Section
814.49.
   (d)   Within thirty days of the effective date of the award of the franchise
agreement, the grantee shall furnish proof to the Board of Trustees that a
satisfactory insurance certificate and performance bond have been obtained.
Such insurance certificate and performance bond shall be approved by the Board,
and a copy of such insurance policy and performance bond, along with written
evidence of payment of the required premiums, shall be filed and maintained
with the Village. The insurance policy and bond shall specify that at least
thirty days prior written notice shall be filed with the Board of any intention
to not renew or to cancel the policy or bond or to make a material change
therein.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82; Ord. 598. Passed 8-23-82.)
814.35 SECURITY FUND.
   (a)   Commencing with the effective date of the franchise, the grantee shall
post a letter of credit or other financial security with the Village, in a form
approved by the Village Attorney, in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000)
as a cash escrow security fund for the faithful performance by the grantee of
all the provisions of the franchise agreement; the grantee's compliance with
all orders, permits and directions of the grantor having jurisdiction over the
acts and defaults under the franchise; and the payment by the grantor of any
claims, liens and taxes due the grantor which arise out of the construction,
operation or maintenance of the system. After the initial construction of the
system is completed, the Village shall, upon the request of the grantee, reduce
the deposit to five thousand dollars ($5,000) and return to the grantee any
overages existing at that time. At the end of two years after such completion
date, the grantee may petition the Village for a reduction of such funds, and
if the Village finds that the performance of the grantee has been such as to
make it reasonably unnecessary to retain such funds for the purposes specified
in this section, the Village may permit the requested reduction or any portion
thereof. The remaining sum shall stand during the term of such franchise as the
security fund in full compliance with this section.
(Ord. 605. Passed 12-13-82.)
   (b)   The sum shall be maintained on deposit throughout the term of the
franchise on a quarterly basis, in an account bearing the maximum interest
permitted by law, which interest shall be payable to the grantee. The grantee
may withdraw the interest on the security fund at any time. However, during the
existence of the security fund, the grantee must agree not to withdraw any part
of the principal amount required at that time as the security fund. The amount
of the security fund shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of
Section
814.10.
   (c)   If the grantee fails, after ten days notice, to pay to the Village any
tax due and unpaid or any lien, claim, damage or cost or expense which the
Village may be compelled to pay for reason of any act or default of the grantee
in connection with the franchise, or fails, after thirty days notice of such
failure, to comply with any provision of the franchise which the Village
determines can be remedied by the expenditure of the security, the Village may
immediately thereafter withdraw the amount thereof from the security fund. In
such event, the grantor shall notify the grantee of the amount withdrawn and
the amount necessarily required to replenish the security fund.
   (d)   The security fund, once established, shall become the property of the
grantor if the franchise is cancelled by reason of the default of the grantee
or revoked for cause.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.36 BOOKS, RECORDS AND REPORTS.
   (a)   The grantee's operation under the franchise agreement shall be viewed
as one financial and reporting unit, and its books and records shall be kept in
such a way as to show the activities of this unit separate from any other
activities of the grantee. The Village may inspect, at any time during normal
business hours, all records and documents related to expenses, revenues and
accounts receivable applicable to the operation of the franchise agreement.
Such records shall be kept available for a minimum of eighteen months after the
month in which a transaction occurs. Access to the records or reports provided
pursuant to Section
814.32(b) shall not be denied on the basis that such records or reports contain
"proprietary" information. Access to the records and reports shall be granted
at the nearest local business office. However, the Village shall treat all
information obtained from the grantee with the same degree of confidentiality
as would be accorded similar information by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   (b)   The grantee shall file, with the Village, true and accurate maps of
the system to be constructed under this chapter and shall keep the same as
current as is practical.
   The grantee shall file, with the Board of Trustees, copies of all
complaints, petitions or other orders of the FCC, EEOC or FAA, in which the
grantee is a named party, and the grantee's response thereto, if any, all
within ten days or as deemed necessary by the Cable Television Commission.
   Upon reasonable notice, the grantee shall appear at any meeting or public
hearing called by the Board to review or evaluate grantee activities or
performance.
   All complaints, petitions or orders received by the Village or the Complaint
Officer related to the grantee's activities under this chapter shall be
forwarded to the grantee and answered by the grantee, with a copy to the
original addressee and the Complaint Officer, within ten days of receipt
thereof.
   (c)   Whenever, pursuant to the franchise, the grantee makes available for
inspection by the grantor, or submits to the grantor, reports containing
information considered proprietary by the grantee, and the information is
separately labeled as such, the grantor shall not disclose or release such
reports or information to the public without prior written consent.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.37 RIGHTS OF REAL ESTATE OWNERS.
   (a)   No property owner, condominium association, managing agent, lessee or
other person in possession or control of any residential building located
within the franchise area shall forbid or prevent any occupant, tenant or
lessee of any such building from receiving cable television services from the
franchisee, or demand or accept payment from any such occupant, tenant or
lessee in any form as a condition of permitting the installation of cable
television facilities or the maintenance of cable television service in any
such building or any portion thereof occupied or leased by such occupant,
tenant or lessee, nor shall such property owner, condominium association,
managing agent, lessee or other person discriminate in rental charges or
otherwise against any occupant, tenant or lessee receiving cable service,
provided, however, that:
      (1)   The owner of such building may require, in exchange and as
compensation for permitting the installation of cable television facilities
within and upon such building, a reasonable sum to be paid by the cable
television franchisee which provides such cable television service, such sum to
be determined in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) hereof; and
      (2)   The cable television franchisee installing such cable television
facilities shall agree to indemnify the owner of such building for any damage
caused by the installation, operation or removal of such cable television
facilities and service.
   (b)   No property owner, condominium association, managing agent, lessee or
other person in possession and control of any improved or unimproved real
estate located within the franchise area shall forbid or prevent the franchisee
or grantee from entering upon such real estate for the purpose of and in
connection with the construction or installation of such cable television
facilities, nor shall any such property owner, condominium association,
managing agent, lessee or other person in possession or control of such real
estate forbid or prevent the grantee from construction or installing upon,
beneath or over such real estate, including any buildings or other structures
located thereon, hardware, cable, equipment, materials or other cable
television facilities utilized by the grantee in the construction and
installation of such cable television system, provided, however, that:
      (3)   The owner of any such real estate may require, in exchange and as
compensation for permitting the construction or installation of cable
television facilities upon, beneath or over such real estate, a reasonable sum
to be paid by the grantee which provides such cable television service, such
sum to be determined in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) hereof; and
      (4)   The grantee who is constructing or installing such cable television
facilities shall agree to indemnify the owner of such real estate for any
damage caused by the installation, operation or removal of such cable
television facilities and service.
   (c)   In any instance in which the owner of a residential building or the
owner of improved or unimproved real estate intends to require the payment of a
reasonable sum in excess of one dollar ($1.00) in exchange for permitting the
installation of cable television facilities in and upon such building or upon,
beneath or over such real estate, the owner shall serve written notice thereof
upon the grantee and the Cable Television Commission. Such notice shall be
served within twenty days of the date on which such owner and the Commission
are notified of the grantee's intention to construct or install cable
television facilities in and upon such building or upon, beneath or over such
real estate. Unless timely notice, as provided in this subsection, is given by
the owner to the grantee and the Commission, it will be conclusively presumed
that the owner of any such building or real estate does not claim or intend to
require a payment of more than one dollar ($1.00) in exchange and as
compensation for permitting the installation of cable television facilities
within and upon such building or upon, beneath or over such real estate.
   (d)   An owner of a residential building described in subsection (a) hereof,
or an owner of improved or unimproved real estate described in subsection (b)
hereof, who has given timely written notice to the grantee and the Commission
as provided in subsection (c) hereof, may assert a claim for reasonable
compensation. If within sixty days after the receipt of the owner's claim, the
grantee has not agreed to pay the amount claimed or some other amount
acceptable to the owner, the owner may bring suit to enforce such claim for
compensation. Any such action shall be brought within six months of the date of
the notice provided for in subsection (c) hereof. In any action brought to
enforce such right, it shall be presumed that reasonable compensation therefor
shall be one dollar ($1.00), but such presumption may be rebutted and overcome
by proof that the owner has a specific alternative use for the space occupied
by cable television facilities, the loss of which will result in a monetary
loss to the owner, or that installation of cable television facilities within
and upon such building or upon, beneath or over such real estate otherwise
substantially interferes with the use and occupancy of such building to an
extent which causes a decrease in the resale or rental value of such building
or real estate.
   (e)   The giving of a notice under subsection (c) hereof, the assertion of a
specific claim or the initiation of legal action to enforce such claim, as
provided in subsection (d) hereof, shall not delay or impair the right of the
grantee to construct or install cable television facilities and maintain cable
television services within or upon any building described in subsection (a)
hereof or upon, beneath or over real estate described in subsection (b) hereof.
   (f)   No owner of a residential building described in subsection (a) hereof
or of improved or unimproved real estate described in subsection (b) hereof
shall resell, without the express, written consent of the grantee and the Board
of Trustees, any cable service, program or signal transmitted by a cable
television company operating under a franchise issued by the Village.
(Ord. 639. Passed 3-12-84.)
814.38 RIGHTS OF GRANTOR.
   (a)   The grantor reserves the right to exercise its governmental powers,
now or hereafter, to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or
granted to the Village, including the right to regulate any satellite system,
multipoint distribution service or master antenna television system as may be
provided by law and for which such regulation is not pre-empted by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   (b)   The grantor reserves the right to amend a franchise when necessary to
enable the grantee to take advantage of advancements in the state of the art
which will afford it an opportunity to more effectively, efficiently or
economically service its subscribers. However, this section shall not be
construed to require the Village to make any amendment. The Board of Trustees
may annually review the current state of the art in respect to services being
provided by cable television companies within a fifty-mile radius of the
Village. If, as a result of such review, the Board determines that there are
significant services available to the industry but not being provided by the
grantee, the Board may:
      (1)   Require the grantee, at its own expense, to conduct and provide to
the Board, within ninety days, a study analyzing the ready availability and
proven reliability of the services, the benefit of such services to the Village
and the subscribers, the financial impact upon the grantee and any other
pertinent matter; and
      (2)   Recommend such additional services as it has determined
appropriate.
   If the Board makes a determination that the services are readily available
to the grantee, have proven reliable in the cable television industry and will
permit a reasonable return to the grantee upon investment, the Board may
authorize and approve such additional services.
   (c)   Upon request, the grantee shall furnish the Village a list of the
names and addresses of persons owning three percent or more of the outstanding
stock or equivalent ownership interest of the grantee. Such list shall include
a roster of the grantee's officers and directors (or equivalent managerial
personnel) and their addresses.
   (d)   The grantee shall not oppose any intervention by the grantor in any
suit or proceeding to which the grantee is a party.
   (e)   The grantee reserves the right of transfer of ownership to the grantor
in those circumstances, which may be provided for in a separate ordinance,
wherein the Village may have the right to purchase the ownership of a grantee's
cable television system or any of its assets. The Village may give notice that
it elects to exercise such right and may acquire such assets at the time of
payment in accordance with terms of such ordinance, if enacted.
   (f)   If the franchise is terminated prior to its expiration date, and the
Village invokes its right to purchase the grantee's cable television system,
the grantee shall file with the Village, within thirty days of the date that
ownership and control passes to the Village or its assignee, a financial
statement clearly showing the gross revenues received by the grantee since the
end of the previous fiscal quarter. The grantee shall pay the franchise fee due
at the time such statement is filed or within thirty days, whichever is sooner.
   (g)   If the Board of Trustees elects to establish a Cable Television
Commission, or elects to purchase a grantee's cable television system or any of
its assets, the Board shall, by ordinance, prescribe the applicable due process
procedures to be followed for such purposes.
   (h)   The Board and the grantee may schedule such performance evaluation
sessions as may be required by Federal or State law or upon the request of
either the Board or the grantee. The evaluation sessions shall be open to the
public and announced in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village.
   (i)   During any review and evaluation session, the grantee shall fully
cooperate with the Board and shall provide such information and documents as
the Board may need to reasonably perform its review to determine whether or not
performance of the system is adequate.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82; Ord. 598. Passed 8-23-82.)
814.39 LOCAL BUSINESS AND MAINTENANCE OFFICE.
   The grantee shall maintain a business and maintenance facility in the
Village which shall be open during normal business hours. Such office shall
have a publicly listed telephone and shall be so operated that complaints and
requests for repairs or adjustments may be received and processed with a
minimum of delay. Provision shall also be made for telephonically receiving
service interruption calls on a twenty-four hour basis.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.40 SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   The grantee shall render prompt and efficient service and repairs, and
shall voluntarily interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest
time possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by
twenty-four hours notice, by the use of a creeper, on all channels and shall
occur during periods of minimum use. The grantee shall maintain an independent
source of "standby" electrical generation equipment sufficient to operate the
system at full capacity.
   (b)   Without additional charges to subscribers, the grantee shall maintain
its facilities in good working order and repair. Any verbal, telephonic or
written complaint relating to the quality or continuity of service shall be
attended to by the close of the second business day following the receipt of
such complaint, provided that the subscriber or his or her representative is
available during this period at the premises to be serviced. If the complaint
is not responded to, or service is not restored to the levels required by the
Federal Communications Commission during such period, the subscriber is
entitled to a rebate of one-thirtieth of his or her monthly service fee for
each day or a part thereof between the end of the second business day and the
time service is restored to good working order.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.41 DELEGATION OF FUNCTIONS.
   Any right, power or duty of the grantor, the Village or any official of the
Village under this chapter may be transferred or delegated, by ordinance,
resolution or other appropriate action of the Board of Trustees, to an
appropriate officer, employee or department of the Village or any legal
authority, including any intergovernmental agency created for the purpose of
regulating the operation and development of the cable television system.
(Ord. 593. Passed 7-12-82.)
814.42 COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any subscriber, user, programmer or member of the general public who
has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television service, equipment
malfunctions, billing or any other matter, which remains unresolved for thirty
days after it has been brought to the grantee's attention, in writing, may file
such complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer, who shall have primary
responsibility for the continuing administration of complaint procedures under
this chapter.
   (b)   Upon the filing of such a complaint, the Complaint Officer shall
notify the grantee and make an investigation to determine whether or not there
is probable cause to credit the allegations. If he or she determines, after
such investigation, that there is probable cause to credit the allegations of
the complaint, he or she shall so notify the grantee and complainant and shall
promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and persuasion. If the
Complaint Officer is unable to obtain conciliation within a reasonable time, he
or she shall, with the consent to the complainant, promptly notify the Cable
Television Commission of such complaint. The Commission shall, within ten days
following the receipt of such notice, schedule a hearing at which it shall
receive evidence to determine if there is a legitimate complaint. Not later
than fourteen days after the conclusion of such a hearing, the Commission shall
make public its decision, which shall include a written statement of its
findings. If the Commission finds that the grantee is in violation of the
franchise agreement, the Commission may order such disbursement from the
security fund, as established in Section
814.35, as it may deem necessary and justified. Hearings may be ex parte if,

      (6)   Up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for the failure to

      (7)   Up to fifty dollars ($50.00) per day for the failure to supply data
requested by the Village in connection with installation, construction,
customers, finances or financial reports or rate review;
      (8)   Up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day, as the Village may
determine, for the persistent failure to comply with reasonable recommendations

other reasonable requests or recommendations as may be made pursuant to

necessary permits and clearances. Within two months, four months and six months

grantor its estimate of the initial construction date. The initial construction
date estimated after six months may be used by the grantor as the presumptive
construction starting date, with all construction requirements based on that
date, provided, however, that the grantee may adjust its estimated initial
construction date upon a showing of delays which are beyond its reasonable
control or which are not reasonably foreseeable. For any schedule delay that
may occur, the burden of proof shall be on the grantee to demonstrate that such
delay was beyond its reasonable control or was not reasonably foreseeable. The
imposition by the grantor of any remedy listed in subsection (a) hereof shall
be in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter.

grantee violates or fails to comply with any other material provision of the
franchise, provided that the grantee has not commenced corrective action within
thirty days of written notice, by certified mail, to the general manager of the
grantee:
      (1)   The grantor may impose a financial penalty, not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000) per day or per incident, for the grantee's individual
willful and/or repeated violation of any provision of the franchise or the
failure to take corrective action with respect to such a violation.
      (2)   The grantor may require the grantee to make rate rebates or
payments to the customers or classes of customers in such amount and on such
basis as the grantor may deem reasonable.
      (3)   The grantor may require the grantee to correct or otherwise remedy
the violation prior to any rate increase becoming effective.
   (b)   If the stated violation or noncompliance is not reasonably curable
within sixty days of the date of the written notice provided for in subsection
(a) hereof, the franchise will not be terminated or revoked, and a remedy will
not be imposed pursuant to Section
814.35 or this section, if the grantee provides, within the sixty days, a plan,
satisfactory to the grantor, to remedy the violation and continues to
demonstrate good faith in seeking to correct the violation.
   (c)   In determining which remedies for the grantee's violation are
appropriate, the grantor shall take into consideration the nature of the
violation, the person bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the
remedy required in order to prevent further such violations and such other
matters as the grantor may deem appropriate. However, adequate penalties must
be imposed if service is in any way materially lessened or if any material
provision of the franchise is not complied with.
   (d)   Within ten days after receipt of the written notice provided for in
subsection (a) hereof, the grantee may request a hearing before an impartial
hearing officer or commission in a full public proceeding affording due
process. Such hearing shall be held within thirty days of the receipt of the
request therefor.
   (e)   Any appeal from the determination of the hearing officer or the Cable
Television Commission shall, within thirty days of the issuance of such
determination, be made to the Board of Trustees.
   (f)   The grantor and the grantee acknowledge that damages at law are an
inadequate remedy for violations of the franchise and agree that either party
may obtain injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of the franchise.

such gross charge an amount equal to three percent of the tax they collect to
reimburse them for the expenses incurred in keeping records, billing customers,
preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the

890.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
   (a)   "Gross charges" means the amount paid to a telecommunications retailer
for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications within
the Village, and for all services rendered in connection therewith, valued in
money, whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services,
and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any
deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the
materials used, labor or service costs, or any other expense whatsoever. In
case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when
paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at
each channel point within the Village, charges for the channel mileage between
each channel point within the Village, and charges for that portion of the
interstate inter-office channel provided within the Village. However, "gross
charges" shall not include:
      (1)   Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made
under:
         A.   The fee imposed by this section;
         B.   Additional charges added to a purchaser's bill under Section 9-
221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act;

      (2)   Charges for a sent-collect telecommunication received outside the
Village;
      (3)   Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of
data or information or the subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or
information intended to change its form or content. Such equipment includes,
but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers, data processing
equipment, tabulating equipment, or accounting equipment, and also includes the
usage of computers under a time-sharing agreement;
      (4)   Charges for customer equipment, including equipment that is leased
or rented by the customer from any source, wherein such charges are
disaggregated and separately identified from other charges;
      (5)   Charges to business enterprises certified under Section 9-222.1 of
the Public Utilities Act to the extent of such exemption and during the period
of time specified by the Village;
      (6)   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment
provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly
owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries, and only to the extent
that the charges between the parent corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation
between the corporations and not the generation of profit other than a
regulatory required profit for the corporation rendering such services;
      (7)   Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related
to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or
excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under
applicable Federal Income Tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to
be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that
portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);
      (8)   Charges paid by inserting coins in coin-operated telecommunications
devices; or
      (9)   Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment
provided to the Village.
   (b)   "Public right-of-way" means any Municipal street, alley, water or
public right-of-way dedicated or commonly used for utility purposes, including

locate or permit the location of utilities consistent with telecommunications
facilities. "Public right-of-way" shall not include any real or personal
Village property that is not specifically described in the previous sentence
and shall not include Village buildings and other structures or improvements,
regardless of whether they are situated in the public right-of-way.
   (c)   "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", or any like
term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within the State of
Illinois, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities,
transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse, or other place of business,
or any agent or other representative operating within this State under the
authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place
of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or
temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business
in this State.
   (d)   "Sale of telecommunications at retail" means the transmitting,
supplying, or furnishing of telecommunications and all services rendered in
connection therewith for a consideration, other than between a parent
corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned
subsidiaries, when the gross charge made by one such corporation to another
such corporation is not greater than the gross charge paid to the retailer for
their use or consumption and not for sale.
   (e)   "Service address" means the location of telecommunications equipment
from which telecommunications services are originated or at which
telecommunications services are received. If this is not a defined location, as
in the case of wireless telecommunications, paging systems, maritime systems,
air-to-ground systems, and the like, "service address" shall mean the location
of the customer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by
the location in Illinois where bills are sent.
   (f)   "Telecommunications" includes, but is not limited to, messages or
information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide-area telephone

requires otherwise, "telecommunications" shall also include wireless
telecommunications as hereinafter defined. "Telecommunications" shall not
include the value added services in which computer processing applications are

purchase of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use
as a component part of the service provided by him or her to the ultimate
retail consumer who originates or terminates the end-to-end communications.
Retailer access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of
intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision and used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end
telecommunications service shall not be included in gross charges as sales for
resale. "Telecommunications" shall not include the provision of cable services
through a cable system as defined in the Cable Communications Act of 1984 (47
U.S.C. 521 and following) as now or hereafter amended or cable or other
programming services subject to an open video system fee payable to the Village

installs, owns, operates or controls equipment in the public right-of-way that
is used or designed to be used to transmit telecommunications in any form.
   (h)   "Telecommunications retailer," "retailer" or "carrier" means and
includes every person engaged in the business of making sales of
telecommunications at retail as defined in this section. The Village may, in
its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the fee hereby
imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within the State,
who, to the satisfaction of the Village, furnishes adequate security to ensure
collection and payment of the fee. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of
such retailer to pay the fee upon all of the gross charges for
telecommunications in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a
retailer maintaining a place of business within the Village.
   (i)   "Wireless telecommunications" includes cellular mobile telephone
services, personal wireless services as defined in Section 704(C) of the

as now or hereafter amended, including all commercial mobile radio services and
paging services.
(Ord. 958. Passed 11-10-97.)
890.02 REGISTRATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS.
   (a)   Every telecommunications provider as defined by this chapter shall
register with the Village within thirty days after the effective date of this
chapter or becoming a telecommunications provider, whichever is later, on a
form to be provided by the Village, provided, however, that any
telecommunications retailer who has filed a return pursuant to Section
890.04(c) shall be deemed to have registered in accordance with this section.
   (b)   Every telecommunications provider who has registered with the Village
pursuant to subsection (a) hereof has an affirmative duty to submit an amended
registration form or current return as required by Section
890.04(c), as the case may be, to the Village, within thirty days from the date
of the occurrence of any changes in the information provided by the
telecommunications provider in the registration form or the most recent return
on file with the Village.
(Ord. 958. Passed 11-10-97.)
890.03 IMPOSITION OF FEE.
   (a)   A Village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee is hereby
imposed upon all telecommunications retailers in the amount of one percent of
all gross charges charged by the telecommunications retailer to service
addresses within the Village for telecommunications originating or received in
the Village.
   (b)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this chapter, the Village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the Village by telecommunications retailers.
Imposition of the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this chapter
does not, however, serve as a limitation on the levying of any taxes or the
imposition of any other fees otherwise authorized by law.
   (c)   The Village telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized by this section shall be collected, enforced, and administered as
set forth in Section
890.04.
(Ord. 958. Passed 11-10-97.)
890.04 COLLECTION OF FEE; ENFORCEMENT; ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   A telecommunications retailer shall charge to and collect from each
customer an additional charge in an amount equal to the Village infrastructure
maintenance fee attributable to that customer's service address.
   (b)   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Manager, the infrastructure
maintenance fee shall be remitted by the telecommunications retailer to the
Village not later than the last day of the month subsequent to the month in
which a bill is issued to the customer, provided, however, that the
telecommunications retailer may retain an amount not to exceed two percent of
the Village infrastructure maintenance fee collected by it to reimburse itself
for expenses incurred in accounting for and remitting the fee.
   (c)   Remittance of the Municipal infrastructure maintenance fee to the
Village shall be accompanied by a return, in a form to be prescribed by the
Village Manager, which shall contain such information as the Village Manager
may reasonably require.
   (d)   Any infrastructure maintenance fee required to be collected pursuant
to this chapter and any such infrastructure maintenance fee collected by such
telecommunications retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village. The charge imposed under subsection
(a) hereof by the telecommunications retailer pursuant to this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the purchaser to the telecommunications retailer who
provides such services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the
same manner as the original charge for such services.
   (e)   If it shall appear that an amount of the infrastructure maintenance
fee has been paid that was not due under the provisions of this chapter,
whether as a result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount
shall be credited against any infrastructure maintenance fee due, or to become
due, under this chapter, from the telecommunications retailer who made the
erroneous payment, provided, however, that the Village Manager may request, and
the telecommunications retailer shall provide, written substantiation for such
credit.
   (f)   Amounts paid under this chapter by telecommunications retailers shall
not be included in the tax base under any of the following acts as described
immediately below:

Act;
      (2)   "Gross receipts" for purposes of the municipal utility tax as
prescribed in Section 8-11-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code;
      (3)   "Gross charges" for purposes of the municipal telecommunications
tax as prescribed in Section 8-11-17 of the Illinois Municipal Code;
      (4)   "Gross revenue" for purposes of the tax on annual gross revenue of
public utilities prescribed in Section 2-202 of the Public Utilities Act.
   (g)   The Village shall have the right, in its discretion, to audit the
books and records of all telecommunications retailers subject to this chapter
to determine whether the telecommunications retailer has properly accounted to
the Village for the Village infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of
the amount of the Village infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by
the telecommunications retailer shall be paid to the Village, plus five percent
of the total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit. If the audit
indicates that the underpayment was more than three percent of the amount
remitted to the Village in a timely manner as provided in this chapter, then
the telecommunications retailer shall reimburse the Village for any costs
incurred by the Village in conducting the audit. Any amounts payable to the
Village pursuant to this subsection shall be paid to the Village within twenty-
one days after the date of issuance of an invoice for the same.
   (h)   The Village Manager, or his or her designee, may promulgate such
further or additional regulations concerning the administration and enforcement
of this chapter, consistent with its provisions, as may be required from time
to time and shall notify all telecommunications retailers that are registered
pursuant to Section
890.02 of such regulations.

890.05 EXISTING FRANCHISES AND LICENSES.

retailers and the Village entered into before the effective date of this
chapter regarding the use of public rights-of-way shall remain valid according
to and for its stated terms, except for any fees, charges or other compensation
to the extent waived.
(Ord. 958. Passed 11-10-97.)
890.06 WAIVER AND FEE IMPLEMENTATION.

waiver is given as provided in Section 25(f) of the Act, whichever is later,
and during the time the Village imposes the telecommunications infrastructure
maintenance fee provided herein, the Village waives all fees, charges, and
other compensation that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to
the Village by a telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing Village
franchise, license, or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer.
This waiver shall only be effective during the time the Infrastructure
Maintenance Fee provided for in this chapter is subject to being lawfully
imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by the
telecommunications retailer from the customer. Any fees, charges or other
compensation that may be due and payable for the period through January 31,
1998, are not waived.
   (b)   The Village Clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified mail,
return receipt requested, to each telecommunications retailer with whom the

upon which to protest the taxes at the time of payment or if the taxpayer paid
the taxes under duress.
   (b)   The statute of limitations on a claim for credit or refund shall be

administered taxes, interest or penalties paid in error shall be as follows:

check or receipt for the payment;
         D.   The taxpayer's recalculation, accompanied by an amended or
revised tax return, in connection with the claim; and
         E.   A request for either a refund or a credit in connection with the
claim to be applied to the amount of tax, interest and penalties overpaid, and,
as applicable, related interest on the amount overpaid; provided, however, that
there shall be no refund and only a credit given in the event the taxpayer owes
any monies to the Village.
      (2)   Within twenty-one days of the receipt by the local tax
administrator of any claim for a refund or credit, the local tax administrator
shall either:
         A.   Grant the claim; or

to the reason for the denial or the partial grant and denial.
      (3)   In the event the local tax administrator grants, in whole or in
part, a claim for refund or credit, the amount of the grant for refund or
credit shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per annum, based on a
year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed, from the date of the

return shall be imposed; and a late payment penalty of five percent of the tax
due shall be imposed. If no return is filed within the time or manner provided
by the controlling tax ordinance and prior to the Village issuing a notice of
tax delinquency or notice of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty
shall be assessed equal to twenty-five percent of the total tax due for the
applicable reporting period for which the return was required to be filed. If
no return is filed after the issuance of a notice of tax delinquency or notice
of tax liability, then a failure to file penalty shall be assessed equal to
thirty-five percent of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period
for which the return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty
shall not apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling
ordinance.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.12 ABATEMENT.
   The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate any
late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the
local tax administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or
failure to make a filing.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.13 INSTALLMENT CONTRACTS.
   The Village may enter into an installment contract with the taxpayer for the
payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local tax
administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the
local tax administrator that the payment is thirty days delinquent, the
taxpayer shall have fourteen working days to cure any delinquency. If the
taxpayer fails to cure the delinquency within the fourteen day period or fails
to demonstrate good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the
local administrator, the installment contract shall be canceled without further
notice to the taxpayer.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.14 PERIOD FOR REQUESTING REFUND OR MAKING PAYMENT OF REMAINING TAX DUE.

the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax
still due and owing.

892.15 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than four
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
   (b)   If any tax return is not filed or if during any four year period for
which a notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the Village,
the tax paid was less than seventy-five percent of the tax due, the statute of
limitations shall be six years maximum after the end of the calendar year in
which return for the applicable period was due or end of the calendar year in
which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (c)   If a fraudulent tax return was filed by the taxpayer, there shall be

(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.16 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the
filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of
filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety days after the
filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within ninety days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.

892.17 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.
   Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be published via normal or
standard publishing requirements, including but not limited to, publication in
pamphlet form. The posting of a tax ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the
publication requirements. Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available
to the public upon request at the Village Clerk's office.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.18 LIENS.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (a)   Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
   (b)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (c)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)
892.19 APPLICATION.

of the Village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this ordinance, this ordinance shall be
controlling.
(Ord. 1064. Passed 12-27-00.)

make or assist in the making of additional inspections of the premises to
ascertain if illegal connections are present. Upon completion of any visual
outside or inside inspection, the Village shall advise the property owner in
writing if any illegal connection is observed, and shall advise as to the
manner of correction to achieve compliance with this chapter. After the
correction is made, the Village shall, at no expense to the owner, make further
inspection of the correction to ensure compliance with this chapter.
(Ord. 413. Passed 8-23-73; 1976 Code § 19-35.)
   (b)   In addition to the inspections provided for in subsection (a) hereof,

storm sewer or waterline extension, in accordance with Village standards and
specifications, inspected and approved by the proper official of the Village,
and when properties other than the property of the person constructing such
improvement intervene and abut upon that section of the street within which
such improvement lies, then, when the constructing owner furnishes
certification and satisfactory evidence of the cost of such improvement, the
Village Clerk and/or the Village Manager, together with the Village Engineer,
shall investigate the reasonableness thereof in accordance with existing
prices. When the corporate authorities are satisfied as to such reasonableness,
the Clerk shall make an appropriate record of the nature, extent, location and
cost of such improvement.

construction of that section of such line abutting the applicant's property,
and shall, before issuing a permit to tap into or connect therewith, receive
such pro-rata contribution for reimbursement. Upon receipt thereof, the Clerk
and/or the Manager shall remit the same to the person constructing such
extension, as set forth in subsection (a) hereof. The determination of the
Clerk and/or the Manager as to the amount of such contribution shall, in the
absence of willful fraud and misconduct, be conclusive as between the Village
and the person having constructed such extension.
(Ord. 377. Passed 7-25-72; 1976 Code § 19-41.)

lines.
(Ord. 377. Passed 7-25-72; 1976 Code § 19-42.)
   (d)   Criteria Determining Extension of Improvement. When an owner of
property contiguous to the property of an owner who has previously constructed
a private improvement, as provided for in subsection (a) hereof, wishes to
connect to and extend the sewer or water line within the public streets, such
extension shall be permitted only if, in the opinion of the Village Engineer,
or an engineer acting for the Village, the existing facility is adequate for
such purpose and provided that such extension is made along the total frontage
of the property of the applicant owner abutting upon the street.
(Ord. 377. Passed 7-25-72; 1976 Code § 19-43.)
1042.17 RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING CONNECTIONS WITH WATER MAINS.
   The following rules and regulations shall govern all connections with the

all uses of Village water and the maintenance of all hydrant connections
connected with the Village water system.
   (a)   No person, except a legally authorized agent of the Village, shall
take water from any public or private hydrant plug, hose, pipe or fountain,
except for fire purposes, for the use of the Fire Department in case of fire,
and except for drinking at public fountains.
   (b)   No person shall willfully break, injure, mar, deface, interfere with
or disturb any building, machinery, apparatus, attachment or appurtenance of
the Village water system, or any public or private hydrant, stop-cock, service
plug or water or service pipe, or any part thereof, or injure or deposit
anything in any service box, or commit any act tending to obstruct or impair
the intended use of any of the above mentioned things, without the permission
of the Village Manager or a person duly authorized to issue permits under this
chapter, except in cases herein provided.
   (c)   No person shall make any excavation in any street, alley or public
ground for the purpose of laying water pipe or a connection into any water or
service pipe already laid without written permission from the Department of
Public Works, and only such persons as are authorized to perform such work
shall do the same.
   (d)   All applications for the introduction of water into any premises, or
for the extension of any water pipe, shall be made to the Department by the
owner or a duly authorized person, on blanks provided by the Department for
that purpose. The application shall state fully and truthfully all purposes for
which the water is required. Should the additional use of water at any time be
required, the person desiring it shall make a new application before such
additional use will be allowed. The applicant must subscribe to and agree to be
bound by such rules governing the use of water as may then be in force or may
be passed from time to time by the Board of Trustees. If there is no objection,
the Department shall thereupon issue a permit authorizing the tapping of the
main and insert a corporation cock for such service and place a stop-cock and

Superintendent of Public Works, the Water Department or an authorized agent
shall have the right to enter, at any reasonable time, any property serviced by
a connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the Village
for the purpose of verifying information submitted by the customer regarding
the required cross-connection control inspection. On demand, the owner, lessees
or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the Superintendent of
Public Works or the Water Department any information which may be requested
regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such property. The
refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the
Superintendent of Public Works of the Water Department, be deemed evidence of
the presence of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Superintendent of Public Works or the Water Department is hereby
authorized and directed to discontinue, after notice to the occupant thereof,
the water service to any property where any connection in violation of the
provisions of this section is known to exist, and to take such other
precautionary measures as he or she may deem necessary to eliminate any danger
of contamination of the public water supply distribution mains. Water service
to such property shall not be restored until such conditions have been
eliminated or corrected in compliance with the provisions of this section and
until a reconnection fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) is paid to the
Village. Immediate disconnection with verbal notice can be effected when the
Superintendent of Public Works or the Water Department reasonably believes that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be
effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the opinion of the Superintendent of
Public Works, the Water Department or the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency, such immediate action is required to prevent actual or potential
contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the Village, the
Superintendent of Public Works, the Water Department, nor its agents or

condition for discharge established by the Village or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
   (b)   The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed
by the owner shall be as stipulated by the Village, but not less than once per
year the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to ensure that there is compliance with Federal, State and
local standards. The owner shall report the results of measurements and
laboratory analyses to the Village at such times and in such a manner as
prescribed by the Village. The owner shall bear the expense of all
measurements, analyses and reporting required by the Village. At such times as
deemed necessary, the Village reserves the right to take measurements and
samples for analysis by an outside laboratory service.
(Ord. 795. Passed 9-27-93.)
1044.35 METHODS OF TESTING AND ANALYSIS.
   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with MWRD standards. If no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling
shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is
appropriate or whether a grab sample should be taken. Normally, but not always,
BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four hour composites
of all outfalls, whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
(Ord. 795. Passed 9-27-93.)
1044.36 SPECIAL AGREEMENTS.

Ch. 1044
1045.01 SEWER AND WATER SINKING FUND.
   (a)   The Village has determined that both the public interest and the
Village policy of correcting illegal connections would be served by the
transfer of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) from the Village Sewer and Water
Account into a Village Sewer and Water Sinking Fund and by the earmarking of
such funds for improvements, rehabilitation, repairs and extensions of the
Village sewer and water system. The Village has further determined that
sufficient excess funds exist for such transfer.
   (b)   Therefore, there is hereby established the Village Sewer and Water
Sinking Fund, and the Director of Finance is hereby authorized to withdraw
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) from the Sewer and Water Fund and place such
funds in such Sinking Fund. This Fund shall be used to pay for any contingent
costs which might be required to complete the policy of enforcing the
Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago (MSDGC) mandate.
(Ord. 661. Passed 10-14-85.)
1045.02 AREAS OF ENFORCEMENT; SPECIAL SERVICE AREAS.
   (a)   There shall be established five specific areas within the Village to
enable the Director of Public Works to meet his or her compliance schedules.
Such areas shall be generally described by boundaries. The inspection reports
from each area shall list the specific address, the name of the owner, the
nature of the violation and the estimated cost of repair.
   (b)   The corporate authorities hereby determine that two of these areas,
namely Area 2 west and Area 2 east, comprising certain portions of property
within the Richton Hills subdivision, may be designated as a special service
area or two special service areas, as the case may be. These special service
areas are unique in that the correction of the many illegal connections therein
would require considerable expense to homeowners. Village investigations find
that many of these illegal connections were created when National Homes, Inc.,
and its successors, built FHA program housing almost two decades ago, and such
violations shall be specifically corrected by special procedures set forth in
this section.
   Moreover, the Village has determined that one of the feasible ways to
finance this project is to levy a special tax upon the specific parcels within
the designated area applicable to such owners who are in violation of this
chapter. This levying of taxes and the ad valorem bonds to be issued therefor
could be enacted by an ordinance pursuant to Illinois R.S. Chapter 120,
Sections 1301 et seq., and pursuant to Section 7(6) of Article VII of the
Illinois Constitution which provides that any non-home rule Village "may levy
or impose additional taxes upon areas within their boundaries in the manner
provided by law for the provision of special services to these areas and for
the payment of debt incurred in order to provide those special services."
   Once the full and complete report is furnished, as provided by this section,
and the Village has determined the appropriate method of financing this
project, then the Village Attorney will be authorized to present the
appropriate ordinance required for these purposes to the corporate authorities
for its consideration for passage. The Village Attorney is hereby authorized to
retain special bond counsel and a special bond consultant whenever he or she
deems it necessary.
   (c)   For property designated as a special service area within Area 2 west
and Area 2 east, the Director of Public Works, in addition to the information
required by subsection (a) hereof, shall also include in his or her inspection
report the permanent index tax number, the full name of each owner of record
and the legal description of the real estate in or on which there is an illegal
connection to the sanitary system.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall preclude any owner of property located
in the designated Areas of 2 west and 2 east from independently contracting for
the correction of illegal connections, and for his or her payment therefor, so
long as the installation is approved by the Director and the Village Manager
and is timely completed.
   (e)   The Village Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to negotiate
with any bank to make financing plans available to property owners in Areas 2
west and 2 east, even if the Village guarantees payment of the funds borrowed
to finance all or part of the corrections of any illegal connections within
Areas 2 west and 2 east.
   (f)   If alternative financing can be arranged, or if the Village determines
the designation of Areas 2 west and 2 east to be special service areas, within
the meaning of Ill. R.S. Chapter 120, Sections 1301 et seq., then a lien shall
be impressed on the real estate of any property owner whose corrections of
illegal connections are paid for by the Village to the extent of such payment
made by the Village in accordance with Illinois R.S. Chapter 24, Sections 11-
138-2 and 11-138-8, and Chapter 82, Sections 72 through 75. Such lien shall
commence with a notice of lien filed in the office of the County Recorder of
Deeds or in the office of the Registrar of Title, as the case may be, and such
notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out the legal description,
the amount of money advanced for services and the date when such amount becomes
delinquent. The Village may foreclose on such lien consistent with State
mortgage law proceedings.
(Ord. 661. Passed 10-14-85.)
1045.03 OPTIONAL CORRECTION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   After the Director of Public Works sends a ninety-day notice to a
property owner demanding the correction of his or her illegal connection
pursuant to Section
1042.14, he or she shall contact the owner, arrange for such owner to pay to
the Village his or her corrective costs or, in the alternative, cause the owner
to arrange for a loan at a bank. Such owner's corrective costs shall also
include any out of pocket loss prorata incurred by the Village, except staff
time.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the owner's estimated costs for corrections, the
Village may create a special escrow trust account and arrange for private
contractors to bid on the work for the designated area involved. Upon approval
of the lowest and responsible bid, the Director shall oversee the work involved
under the direction of the Village Manager and pay the contractor in full upon
his or her full satisfaction of the completed work.
   (c)   Because an emergency exists and procurement of this special work is
unique, the Village Engineer or the Director may solicit bids privately rather
than advertise for bids in accordance with customary procedures.

independently contracting for the correction of illegal connections, and for
his or her payment therefor, so long as the installation is approved by the
Director and the Village Manager and is timely completed.
   (e)   The Director shall promulgate such rules and regulations as he or she
deems necessary to implement these procedures upon concurrence of the Board of
Trustees. He or she may send such other follow-up notices to property owners in
violation, in addition to the first ninety-day notice, as he or she deems
necessary.
   (f)   The Village shall waive any permits or permit fees which may be
required to implement these corrections.
   (g)   The Director shall continue in-house inspections and smoke testings

(Ord. 661. Passed 10-14-85.)
1045.04 COLLECTION OF CORRECTION CHARGES; ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   If the Director of Public Works, at the direction of the Village
Manager, determines, upon good cause shown, that a property owner is unable to
pay for his or her corrective costs of any project area installation let to a
contractor, or is unable to pay for his or her own private installation, then
the Village may assist him or her by advancing such amount of his or her
estimated cost as may be necessary, in whole or in part, upon good and valuable
security furnished. Such advance shall be repaid within four years thereafter
by adding such amortized billing, together with a reasonable rate of interest
as a surcharge, on such owner's sewer and water bill.
   (b)   Upon an owner's failure to timely pay his or her appropriate sewer and
water bill, the Village may shut off his or her water in accordance with its
authority. The Village shall not shut off such owner's water solely for failure
to pay such surcharge.
   (c)   To further secure the Village in the repayment of any advances once
made to an owner in need, the owner shall pledge or post good and sufficient
security in a form and amount satisfactory to the Village Attorney. He or she
shall further submit evidence of his or her title and ownership of the real
estate and the contract for the corrections, upon request.
   (d)   For any owner who receives Village advances under this section and
fails to correct his or her illegal connection, or for any owner who fails to
correct his or her illegal connection once notice of the same has been sent to
him or her, the Village may elect to cause such correction, pay the costs
thereof and impose additional sewer and water billing as provided in subsection
(a) hereof. The same procedure may be followed if such charges or surcharge
rates are not paid by the owner on his or her utility bill.
   In either event, a lien shall be impressed on the real estate of any
property owner to which this subsection applies, pursuant to Illinois R.S.
Chapter 24, Sections 11-138-2 and 11-138-8, and Chapter 82, Sections 72 through
75. Such lien shall commence with a notice of lien filed in the office of the
County Recorder of Deeds or in the office of the Registrar of Titles, as the
case may be, and such notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out the
legal description, the amount of money advanced for services and the date when
such amount becomes delinquent. The Village may foreclose on such lien
consistent with State mortgage law proceedings.
   (e)   The Village may assist such owner, whenever practical, to cause such
correction policy to be implemented.
   (f)   Nothing in this section shall preclude the Village from prosecuting
such violations under any Federal or State law, applicable Metropolitan
Sanitary District of Greater Chicago rules or these Codified Ordinances. The
Village shall have other cumulative remedies it may utilize and may apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction for equitable and/or legal relief as it deems
appropriate.
   (g)   No waiver or sufference of any breach, covenant or agreement with any
owner shall operate as a waiver of any subsequent breach, covenant or agreement
with respect to that owner, nor shall any delay by the Village in enforcing
these corrective proceedings operate as a waiver of such owner's obligation to
correct his or her illegal connection, nor shall any waiver of Village
enforcement to any particular owner due to his or her individual and particular
circumstances operate as a waiver of any other owner's obligation under this
chapter and other provisions of these Codified Ordinances, particularly
Chapter 1042.
(Ord. 661. Passed 10-14-85.)
1045.05 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   If any provision of this chapter is inconsistent with a provision of any
other Village ordinance, then this chapter shall prevail over any other
inconsistency to the extent of such inconsistency, but only for and until the
time the purposes of this chapter have been fully accomplished.
(Ord. 661. Passed 10-14-85.)

1052.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the Village's
jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the Village
rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.
   (b)   Intent. In enacting this Chapter, The Village of Richton Park intends
to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the Village of Richton Park
and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys,
parkways and other public ways and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
      (6)   Preserve the character of neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way;
      (9)   Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
   (c)   Facilities Subject to This Chapter. This Chapter applies to all
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public
rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully
established prior to the effective date of this Chapter may continue to be
maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and
located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise,
license or similar agreement. This Chapter shall not apply to any facilities
constructed by others to be owned by the Village.
   (d)   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The Village, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the Village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with
this Chapter.
   (e)   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.
      (1)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this Chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any
telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
      (2)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,
license or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or
similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
   (f)    Conflicts with Other Ordinances. This Chapter supersedes all
ordinances or parts of ordinances adopted prior hereto that are in conflict
herewith to the extent of such conflict.
   (g)   Conflicts with State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable
federal or State laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
Chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or State laws or regulations.
   (h)   Sound Engineering Judgment. The Village shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this Chapter and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter when the Village so
determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the
Village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health,
safety and welfare.

property and to minimize disruptions to efficient pedestrian and vehicular
traffic; and
         B.   An emergency contingency plan which shall specify the nature of
potential emergencies, including, without limitation, construction and
hazardous materials emergencies, and the intended response by the applicant.
The intended response shall include notification to the Village and shall
promote protection of the safety and convenience of the public. Compliance with
ILCC regulations for emergency contingency plans constitutes compliance with
this Section unless the Village finds that additional information or assurances
are needed;
      (6)   Drawings, plans and specifications showing the work proposed,
including the certification of an engineer that such drawings, plans, and
specifications comply with applicable codes, rules, and regulations;

      (10)   Such additional information as may be reasonably required by the
Village.
   (d)   Supplemental Application Requirements for Specific Types of Utilities.
In addition to the requirements of subsection (c) of this Section, the permit
application shall include the following items as applicable to the specific
utility that is the subject of the permit application:
      (1)   In the case of new electric power, communications, cable service,
video service or natural gas distribution system installation, evidence that
any “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity” or other regulatory
authorization that the applicant is required to have, or that applicant has

utility that is paying the municipal electricity infrastructure maintenance fee
pursuant to the Electricity Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.05 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit applications,
containing all required documentation, shall be examined by Village Engineer
and the Director of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. If the
application does not conform to the requirements of all applicable ordinances,
codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Engineer or Director of Public
Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor.
If the Village Engineer and Director of Public Works are satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Chapter and all applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Director of Public Works
shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. In all instances it shall
be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer or Director of Public Works, that the construction proposed under the
application shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (b)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220 ILCS 65/4,
a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it intends to
commence work governed by this Chapter for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten days prior to the commencement of
work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty days prior to the
commencement of work requiring excavation. The Director of Public Works shall
specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed,
used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Director of Public Works fails to provide
such specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either
(i) ten days after service of notice to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for new construction or
(ii) twenty-five days after service of notice by the telecommunications
retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new construction, the
telecommunications retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under
this Chapter. For purposes of determining when the ten or twenty-five day
period specified in this subsection begins, service of notice to the Village
shall be considered to have occurred on the date that the Village has received
all of the documentation required to be submitted under Section 25-105(b)(1).
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village, where a
permit is required for work pursuant to Section
1052.04 of this Chapter the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the
Village an application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed. Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of subsection (a) of this
Section.
   (c)   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five days after
the submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted upon by the Village,
provided the holder has complied with all applicable Village codes, ordinances
and regulations.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this Chapter on Village rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (b)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the Village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.07 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this Chapter, it shall be treated as a
request for variance in accordance with Section
1052.21 of this Chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify
the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or
plans therefor.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.08 INSURANCE.
   (a)   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as “X”, “C”, and “U” coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         A.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         B.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one accident; and
         C.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.
   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors
and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Section.
   (b)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this Section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (c)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the Village within ten days following
receipt of a written request therefor from the Village. In lieu of a copy of
the policy, a certificate indicating that the insurance policies required by
this Section have been obtained and are in force, may be submitted with the
approval of the Director of Public Works.
   (d)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:
      “It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled
nor the intention not to renew be stated until ten (10)) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of
a written notice addressed to the Village's Director of Public Works of such
intent to cancel or not to renew.”     Within seven days after receipt by the
Village of said notice, and in no event later than three days prior to said
cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of
replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.
   (e)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this
Section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and
(d) of this Section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of
this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a “private self insurer”
under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (f)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.09 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, and costs
of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of
or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Chapter by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.10 SECURITY.
   (a)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this Section. The security fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The security fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this
Chapter; and
      (3)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by permittee in violation of this Chapter including, without
limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this Chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Chapter or any other applicable law.
   (b)   Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form
acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided
pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, Will or
DuPage Counties, Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (c)   Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village, and may also include reasonable, directly
related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the
permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple
locations in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where
construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial
completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village may, in
the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount
of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be
equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions
of this subsection (c) for any single phase. The security fund for each
construction project will be ten dollars ($10.00) per lineal foot of the
project, or the company may post a yearly cash retainer or letter of credit for
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) (replenished yearly), or a bond for an amount
determined by the Village, for all construction work to be undertaken that
year.
   (d)   Withdrawals. The Village, upon fourteen days' advance written notice
stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under
this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that
the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for such amount within the
fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the Village
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
   (e)   Replenishment. Within fourteen days after receipt of written notice
from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection
(c) of this Section.
   (f)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such
withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required
in subsection (c) of this Section.
   (g)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (h)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.11 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (a)   Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village may revoke or suspend a
permit issued pursuant to this Chapter for one or more of the following
reasons:
      (1)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially incomplete
statements in the permit application;
      (2)   Non-compliance with this Chapter;
      (3)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of permittee's facilities
on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the public rights-of-way
presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health, safety, or welfare;
or
      (4)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities substantially in
accordance with the permit and approved plans.
   (b)   Notice of Revocation or Suspension.  The Village shall send written
notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this
Chapter stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or suspension and the
alternatives available to permittee under this Section.
   (c)   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of Revocation or
Suspension. Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or suspension from
the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that no cause exists
for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village, the
deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village within five working days after receipt of the written
notice of revocation;
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the public rights-of-way and restore the rights-
of-way to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof of such
removal to the Village within ten days after receipt of the written notice of
revocation.
   The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the time
periods provided in this subsection; or
   (d)   Village Correction and Notice. If the deficiency creates an imminent
threat to life, health or safety, the Village may correct the deficiency
immediately upon verbal notice by the Village to permittee.
   (e)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order immediately upon
discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection (a)
of this Section.
   (f)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection (c) of this Section, the Village or
its designee may, at the option of the Village:
      (1)   Correct the deficiencies;
      (2)   Upon not less than twenty days notice to the permittee, remove the
subject facilities or equipment; or
      (3)   After not less than thirty days notice to the permittee of failure
to cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village.
The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of
removal.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.12 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR OWNER'S IDENTITY OR LEGAL STATUS.
   (a)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village no less
than thirty days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility in the
right-of-way or change in identity of the utility. The new owner of the utility
or the facility shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the
former owner under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances,
rules and regulations, including this Chapter, with respect to the work and
facilities in the right-of-way.
   (b)   Amended Permit. A new owner shall request that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have
accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if
the new owner uses the facility or allows it to remain on the Village's right-
of-way.
   (c)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.13 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Standards and Principles. All construction in the right-of-way shall
be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules and regulations,
and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control and construction
principles, sound engineering judgment and, where applicable, the principles
and standards set forth in any applicable ordinances, rules, regulations or
manuals of the Village and in the following IDOT publications:
      (1)   Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction;
      (2)   Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special Provisions;
      (3)   Highway Design Manual;

exists between or among differing principles and standards required by this
Chapter, the Village Engineer shall determine, in the exercise of sound
engineering judgment, which principles apply and such decision shall be final.
If requested, the Village Engineer shall state which standard or principle will
apply to the construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the
future.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.14 TRAFFIC CONTROL.
   (a)   Minimum Requirements. The Village's minimum requirements for traffic
protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices and this Code. The Village Director of Public Works may require that
additional traffic protection measures be taken, if because of the location
where the work is to be performed or because of anticipated high traffic
volumes, he determines additional traffic protection measures are warranted.
   (b)   Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers. The utility is
responsible for providing and installing warning signs, protective devices and
flaggers, when necessary, meeting all applicable federal, state, and local
requirements for protection of the public and the utility's workers when
performing any work on the public rights-of-way.
   (c)   Interference with Traffic. All work shall be phased so that there is
minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The Director of
Public Works may prohibit work from being performed at specified hours or on
specified days where higher than usual traffic volumes are anticipated.
   (d)   Notice When Access is Blocked. At least forty-eight hours prior to
beginning work that will partially or completely block access to any residence,
business or institution, the utility shall notify the resident, business or
institution of the approximate beginning time and duration of such work;
provided, however, that in cases involving emergency repairs pursuant to
Section 1052.20 of this Chapter, the utility shall provide such notice as is
practicable under the circumstances.
   (e)   Compliance. The utility shall take immediate action to correct any
deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought to the
utility's attention by the Village.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.15 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Parallel Facilities Located Within Rights-of-Way.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility may be
located within the right-of-way only if overhead utility facilities already
exist in the area of the right-of-way where the overhead parallel facility is
proposed to be located and if:
         A.   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way line
and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole alignment
will permit;
         B.   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable from
the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6 m) behind the face of the
curb, where available;
         C.   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2 m) outside the
outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         D.   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         E.   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot (0.3
m) of the right-of-way or as near as possible to the right-of-way line.
      (2)   Underground Parallel Facilities. An underground parallel facility
may be located within the right-of-way only if approved by the Director of
Public Works and:
         A.   The facility is located as near the right-of-way line as
practicable and not more than eight feet (2.4 m) from and parallel to the
right-of-way line, and five feet (1.5 m) from any water main;
         B.   A new facility may be located under the paved portion of a
roadway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         C.   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as approved by the Director of Public Works and any
above-grounded appurtenance shall be located within one foot (0.3 m) of the
right-of-way line or as near as practicable.
   (b)   Facilities Crossing Roadways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of Village roadways
may require the incorporation of materials and protections (such as encasement
or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs to the roadway
resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be
located in culverts, or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety-degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a ninety-degree angle to the centerline as practicable, unless
otherwise approved by the Village.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or
communication facility may cross a right-of-way only if:
         A.   It has a minimum vertical line clearance as required by ILCC's
rules entitled, “Construction of Electric Power and Communication Lines” (83
III. Adm. Code 305);
         B.   Poles are located within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way
line and outside of the clear zone; and
         C.   Overhead crossings at major intersections are avoided.
      (5)   Underground power or communication facility. An underground power
or communication facility may cross a right-of-way only if:
         A.   The design materials and construction methods will provide
maximum maintenance-free service life; and
         B.   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable future expansion needs is
provided in the initial installation.
      (6)   Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at
each right-of-way line where an underground facility other than a power or
communication facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type
of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be
eliminated as provided in current federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. 192.707).
   (c)   Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way. The Village
may require that facilities be located within particular rights-of-way (a
public utility easement, for example) that are not highways, rather than within
particular highways.
   (d)   Freestanding Facilities.
      (1)   The Village may restrict the location and size of any freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way.
      (2)   The Village may require any freestanding facility located within a
right-of-way to be screened from view.

      (1)   The Village may prohibit the installation of facilities in
particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees, vegetation or terrain
features visible to the highway user or impair the aesthetic quality of the
lands being traversed.
   (f)   Above Ground Installation. Above ground facilities may be installed
only if:
      (1)   Existing facilities in the area are located above ground;
      (2)   New underground installation is not technically feasible, as
determined by the Village Engineer; and
      (3)   The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will
employ suitable design and materials, to provide the greatest protection of
aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed without adversely affecting
safety. Suitable designs include, but are not limited to, self-supporting
armless, single-pole construction with vertical configuration of conductors and
cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable -the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
      (4)   The above ground facilities installed are located so as to cause
only minimal interference with the use of any right-of-way within which the
facilities are installed and with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners who adjoin said right-of-way.
      (5)   The smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power
pedestals and/or cabinets then in use by the facility owner for the type of
above ground facility shall be used.

measured from the base or bottom support the facility is located above ground.
   (g)   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the utility has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A utility shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure supporting data demonstrating the
impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         A.   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         B.   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the roadway
structure in the transportation system;
         C.   The alternative routings available to the utility and their
comparative practicability;
         D.   The proposed method of attachment;
         E.   The ability of the structure to bear the increased load of the
proposed facility;
         F.   The degree of interference with bridge maintenance and painting;
         G.   The effect on the visual quality of the structure; and
         H.   The public benefit expected from the utility service as compared
to the risk involved.

one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Village Engineer and/or Director of Public
Works.
         B.   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by Chapter 6 of the Illinois
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where practicable, the excavated
material shall be deposited between the roadway and the trench as added
protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to remain on the paved
portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not allow for windrowing
excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway, excavated material
shall be hauled to an off-road location.
         C.   The utility shall not trench within the drip line of any tree
designated by the Village to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.

time of the reconstruction or resurfacing or unless a pavement cut is necessary
for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         A.   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
roadway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
Village. Casing pipes shall be installed where required and approved by the
Village Engineer and/or Director of Public Works.
         B.   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend within one
foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes shall be
located in the area established as clear zone for that particular section of
the roadway.
         C.   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         D.   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than 60 psig, encasement may be eliminated only if: (1)
extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or repair and (2)
cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         E.   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.

activities in the right- of-way in accordance with applicable Illinois laws and
regulations, and additionally, with such local franchise or other agreement
with the Village of Richton Park as permitted by law.
   (b)   Other Utilities - Tree Trimming Permit Required. Tree trimming that is
done by any other utility with facilities in the right-of-way and that is not
performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically
governing same, shall not be considered normal maintenance operation, but shall
require the application for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any
other permit required under this Chapter.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require the
removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would leave
them in an unacceptable condition.
   (c)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village may
require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of
special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side
arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement
in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   (b)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty days following
written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains
any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-
way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or
appurtenances from the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and
subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or
franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
      (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or franchise, if required;
      (3)   If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance
of a required permit in violation of this Chapter; or
      (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.
   (c)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-
way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be necessary, appropriate

right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary
protection for traffic on the roadway or the public on the right-of-way
including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does
not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to
require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an
emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility
is available.
      (2)   In an emergency, the utility shall, immediately, notify the Village
Police Department of the situation. This notification shall include a
description of the problem, work being undertaken, and what steps have been
taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make
the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere
with the free movement of traffic, the Village Police Department shall be
notified immediately.

variance is authorized for each provision of this Chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
   (c)   Conditions for Granting of Variance. The Village Board may authorize a
variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
      (1)   One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such
as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special
hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the
public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
      (2)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that
would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
   (d)   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance. As a condition for
authorizing a variance, the Village Board may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be
expressly contained within this Chapter but which carry out the purposes of
this Chapter.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.22 PENALTIES.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance
with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the Village
will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the
utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
Chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost appointment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a
utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.23 ENFORCEMENT.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or
further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Chapter.
(Ord. 1446. Passed 1-11-09.)
1052.24 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
Chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of

1214.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   Purpose. Landscaping shall be provided as part of any site plan and or
subdivision design. Landscaping regulation is designed to achieve a number of
objectives, including: to maintain and protect property values, create
transitions, and reduce the negative impacts of surrounding land uses; provide
relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare and the spread of dust and/or debris;
enhance the aesthetic appearance of the Village; reduce soil erosion and
silting of local detention facilities and lakes; preserve existing plant and
wildlife species; and reduce the effects of wind and heat through the provision
of shade.
   (b)   Policies and Intent. All plans shall be conceived with the entire site
in mind by integrating the various elements of the site. The intent of this
chapter shall be to preserve and enhance the existing vegetation and ground
cover, minimize coverage by impervious surfaces, regulate grading and the
movement of soils by working with the natural grade of the site, and provide
on-site detention through the use of landscaping for run-off created by
impervious surfaces.
   (c)   Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all zoning
districts and land uses within the Village. The regulations contained herein
shall be applied for any plan, plat or permit requiring review and/or approval
involving any land development, alteration and/or modification of a zoning lot,
building, structure, or parking facility contained therein requiring Planning
Department approval.
   Individuals purchasing property within a completed residential development,
and homeowners' associations in the case of townhome and condominium
developments, shall be exempt from the planting specifications and regulations
contained herein, with the following exceptions:
      (1)   Any landscape plan approved as part of a development shall be
maintained as the minimum landscape requirements for that development and shall
not be removed without Planning Commission approval;
      (2)   All maintenance responsibilities as specified in Section
1214.06 and the proximity of plant materials to Municipal utilities and
property as stated in Section
1214.04 shall be enforced; and
      (3)   Parkway trees and plantings shall be required to meet all
established regulations for the applicable district.
(Ord. 940. Passed 4-14-97.)
1214.02 LANDSCAPE PLAN.
   A landscape plan shall be submitted with each preliminary plat application
and/or plan. Landscape plans shall identify existing and proposed trees,
shrubs, and ground covers, natural features, such as rock outcroppings,
wetlands, and other landscaping elements. All plans shall show the existing
and/or proposed locations of plantings and/or construction details, including
paving materials, walls, fences, and street furniture. All plans shall indicate
the tree species, spacing, number of trees, and an approximate planting time
table. All existing plant material to be preserved during construction shall be
indicated on the submitted landscape plans along with the proposed methods for
protection.
(Ord. 940. Passed 4-14-97.)
1214.03 SITE PROTECTION AND GENERAL PLANTING REQUIREMENTS; ALL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Topsoil Preservation. A permit shall be required prior to the
clearing, grading, transportation, or other movement of soil or earth. A

permit shall not be required for roto-tilling, planting, or other activity
typically associated with privately maintained residential lots and gardens.
Topsoil moved during construction shall be redistributed on all re-graded
surfaces to provide a minimum of six inches of even cover throughout the
development area, and shall be stabilized following final grading using seed,
sod, hydro-seed, or other vegetation. During construction, erosion control
devices, including silt fences, hay bails, and tarps, shall be used to prevent
destabilized soils from being washed or blown from the site. All erosion
control measures shall be approved by the Village Engineer prior to beginning
construction.
   (b)   Protection of Existing Plantings and Natural Features. A minimum of
ten percent of the natural features of the site, including trees, rare plants,
watercourses, historic areas, and other irreplaceable assets, shall be
maintained. This requirement is in addition to all other required land
donations. Temporary material and soil deposit may not be placed within five
feet of shrubs or within ten feet of the drip line of any tree designated to be
retained on the landscape plan. Protective barriers and tree wells shall be
installed around all plants, trees, and/or groups thereof that are to be
retained. Barriers shall be at least four feet in height and constructed of
durable materials and are to remain in place until construction is completed.
   (c)   Debris Removal. All stumps, tree parts, litter, brush, weeds, scrap or
excess building materials, or other debris, shall be removed from the site
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. No tree stumps, tree parts, or

                                                  A durable material that can
                                                  be easily cut and repaired as
                                                  needed. Requires occasional
Asphalt                Low construction cost      resurfacing. Is an absorber
                                                  of heat and is aesthetically
                                                  unappealing in large
                                                  expanses.
                                                  Requires minimal maintenance,
                                                  but if not made properly,
Concrete               Moderate construction cost will crack. Not attractive in
                                                  large expanses but does work
                                                  well with other paving
                                                  materials.
                                                  Long life expectancy with
                       High construction cost     minimal maintenance. The

                                                  attractive than normal
                                                  concrete.
                                                  Long life expectancy and

                                                  Is made in a wide range of
                                                  colors and is highly
                                                  attractive. Can be laid in a
Brick and Brick Pavers Moderate to high           variety of patterns and is
                       construction cost          durable. Snow is not easily
                                                  removed and if not cared for
                                                  can be dangerous to
                                                  pedestrians.
                                                  Economical and attractive
                                                  when used in conjunction with
                                                  other paving surfaces (i.e.
Brick Grid             Moderate construction cost entrances, courts, plazas and
                                                  private spaces). Requires
                                                  minimal maintenance when

                                                  Used primarily for special
                                                  effects and has a wide range
                                                  of designs. Requires
Wood Decking           Low construction cost      continual maintenance and
                                                  repair. If not treated
                                                  properly, has a very limited
                                                  life span.
                                                  Excellent surface material.
                                                  It is durable and attractive
                                                  and is made in a wide range
                                                  of colors, textures and
Stone                  High construction cost     styles. Granites are among
                                                  the most durable. The type of
                                                  stone used should be
                                                  appropriate for the local
                                                  climate and environmental

RHODODENDRONS
There are over 900 species and an infinite number of cultivars that comprise
the genus 'Rhododendr on'. While often considered separate species, azaleas are
included in the genus 'Rhododendr on'. Azaleas have been classified above as
deciduous shrubs. Rhododendro ns are characterized by very showy spring flowers
and evergreen foliage. Azaleas differ from true rhododendro ns in that they are
deciduous and generally smaller. Both require a well-drained acidic soil and
protection from harsh winter conditions.

PINE/SPRUCE
There are many dwarf and weeping varieties of pine and spruce that may be
acceptable for use as evergreen shrubs but do not satisfy the intent of this
chapter for evergreen trees. They are too numerous to list here.
YEW
There are too many varieties of yew to list here. The most commonly used yews
in Central Illinois fall under one of two species - Taxus cuspidata and Taxus x
media. Taxus cuspidata tend to be larger than Taxus x media. While some yews
can actually grow to be as tall as sixty feet, they are classified as shrubs.
The reason for such classification is that yews will not take on the typical
form of an evergreen tree if allowed to grow to maturity. Rather, it will have
the appearence of an overgrown, poorly maintained shrub.

   (c)   Elimination of Code Violations. Any and all violations stated in the
report of the inspector must be eliminated or corrected prior to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy. If any and all violations are not eliminated or
corrected within the time specified in the report of the inspector, the owner
shall be deemed to be in violation of this chapter and subject to the fines and
penalties contained herein.
   (d)   Denial. If, after the inspector determines that the premises is not in
compliance with all the provisions of the International Property Maintenance
Code, as adopted in
Chapter 1480  of these Codified Ordinances, and such compliance could not be
effected prior to the scheduled occupancy of the premises, the inspector shall
set forth a reasonable time frame in which to correct these violations. After
the reinspection of the premises and a finding that such corrections were not
effected within the time frame set for such purpose, the inspector shall
thereupon serve notice or order denying the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy and shall inform the owner, agent or person in charge of the premises
of the penalty provisions as stipulated in the International Property
Maintenance Code, as adopted in
Chapter 1480  of these Codified Ordinances. However, the inspector shall
withhold, for good cause, the issuance of the certificate of occupancy and
prohibit the premises to be occupied until correction of the outstanding
violations is achieved.
   (e)   Exception. In the event that the culmination of the sale of a premises
would be jeopardized if violations are unable to be corrected within the
specified time frame, a certificate of occupancy may be issued by the inspector
if violations are not corrected, provided that all of the following are true.
      (1)   Security is posted with the Village in a sufficient amount to cover
all expenses needed to correct the violations, but not less than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) plus all reinspection fees and contingency expense.
      (2)   The new owner, in addition to posting the cash security bond,
states in writing that he or she expressly undertakes and assumes
responsibility for the corrections within a time frame not to exceed thirty
days. The new owner shall also authorize the inspector to enter the dwelling
within five working days after the required date of compliance to ascertain if
the corrections have been made either by him or her or the previous owner.
      (3)   The original owner understands that the abatement of any of the
violations found during the occupancy inspection is his or her responsibility,
and in the event that the new owner refuses to accept responsibility for the
repair of the violations under the provisions of paragraph (e)(2) hereof, he or
she shall be required to abate the violations or be subject to the penalties
contained herein.

agreement is not consummated or is terminated so that the new owner, occupant
or tenant would not thereupon occupy such premises in question, then the issued
certificate of occupancy shall expire after six months from the date of
issuance. Upon the expiration of this certificate of occupancy, it may be

it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of the
crime-free lease addendum has occurred.

proceedings based on the tenant's violation of the crime-free lease addendum,
the Village will, at no charge to the landlord and without the necessity for
subpoena, cooperate by arranging for Village staff who have relevant
information to testify at any such legal proceeding.
   (d)   Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated in this
Section 1467.12, no tenant or landlord shall be subject to any penalty under

or about the rental premises is not considered criminal activity for purposes
of subsection (f)(1) hereof, except as to the perpetrator of such violence.
      (4)   Violation of any of the above provisions shall be a material
violation of the lease and good cause for termination of the tenancy. A single
violation of any provision of this added addendum shall be deemed a serious
violation and material non-compliance with the lease. Any violation of the
above provisions will still be considered a violation regardless of whether or
not the tenant could not control the behavior of other occupants of the
premises. It is understood and agreed that a single violation shall be good
cause for termination of the lease under the Illinois Compiled Statutes. Unless
otherwise provided by law, proof of violation shall not require criminal
conviction, but shall be by preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance of the
evidence can be determined by but not limited to a police report, police

served upon any occupant or other person of suitable age and discretion who is
present at the premises and residing therein, notwithstanding the fact that a
tenant, co-signer, occupant or guarantor may reside at a different location
other than the property address described in the lease agreement. This
agreement regarding service is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any manner
of service authorized under Illinois law or rule. By signing this lease the
undersigned hereby waives any objection to service carried out under the terms
of this agreement. This provision shall be effective for any extension, renewal
or modification of the initial lease.
(Ord. 1829. Passed 2-12-24.)
1467.13 PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION; HEARING OPPORTUNITY.
   Simultaneously with the service of any request made by the Village upon a
landlord for implementation of eviction or other proceedings to terminate a
residential lease, the procedures set forth in this section shall apply.
   (a)   Notice shall be served by personal delivery, U.S. Mail, or e-mail if
available upon the landlord and the tenant, containing at a minimum, a copy of
this chapter and facts alleging the grounds for revocation or suspension of the
lessor's or landlord's license, and advising that either landlord or tenant may
appeal this preliminary determination. In the event neither the tenant nor the
landlord files a written appeal under this section with the Village Manager
within ten calendar days of the date stated on the notice served, the right to
appeal shall be deemed waived. In the discretion of the hearing officer
described below, an appeal may be accepted late.
   (b)   In the event of the timely filing of a written appeal by the landlord
or the tenant under this section, the party appealing shall receive a hearing
before a hearing officer appointed by the Village Manager before any steps are
taken toward revocation of the landlord's business license, and before further
steps taken by the Village to request eviction.
   (c)   An appeal may be filed by the landlord, or the tenant. "Tenant" shall
mean the adult person (or persons) (other than a live-in aide):
      (1)   Who resides in the unit, and who entered into the lease as lessee
of the dwelling unit, or, if no such person now resides in the unit.
      (2)   Who resides in the unit, and who is the remaining head of household
of the tenant family residing in the dwelling unit.
   (d)   Failure to request a hearing. Failure to request a hearing shall not
constitute a waiver by the tenant of his or her right thereafter to contest an
eviction disposing of the eviction complaint in an appropriate judicial
proceeding.
   (e)   Scheduling of hearings. Upon a party's filing an appeal, a hearing
shall be scheduled by the hearing officer. A written notification specifying
the time, place and the procedures governing the hearing shall be mailed to the
landlord and tenant.
   (f)   The party appealing shall be afforded a fair hearing before the
hearing officer, which shall include:
      (1)   A pre-hearing opportunity to examine documents, including records
and regulations, that are directly relevant to the hearing. The tenant or
landlord shall be allowed to copy any such document at their own expense.
      (2)   The right to be represented by counsel or other person chosen as
the landlord's or tenant's representative, and to have such person make
statements on the tenant's behalf;
      (3)   The right to present evidence and arguments in support of the
landlord's or tenant's grievance, to controvert evidence relied on by the
police or building and zoning administrator, and to confront and cross-examine
all Village employees who made the determination of a violation; and
      (4)   A decision based solely and exclusively upon the facts presented at
the hearing, based upon the preponderance of the evidence presented.
   (g)   The hearing officer may render a decision without proceeding with the
hearing if the hearing officer determines that the issue has been previously
decided in another proceeding.
   (h)   If an appealing party fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the
hearing officer may make a determination to postpone the hearing for a time not
to exceed five business days or may make a determination that the party has
waived his or her right to a hearing. Both the landlord and tenant shall be
notified of the determination by the hearing officer: Provided, that a
determination that a party has waived his or her right to a hearing shall not
constitute a waiver of any right the appealing party may have to contest the
disposition of the grievance in an appropriate judicial proceeding.
   (i)   At the hearing, the Village will present evidence and testimony in
support of the determination.
   (j)   The hearing shall be conducted informally by the hearing officer and
pertinent oral or documentary evidence may be received without strict
compliance with the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The
hearing officer may rely on any evidence that prudent people would rely upon in
the conduct of serious affairs. Failure to comply with the directions of the
hearing officer to maintain decorum and order may result in exclusion from the
proceedings or in a decision adverse to the interests of the disorderly party,
and granting or denial of the relief sought, in the hearing officer's
discretion.
   (k)   The hearing officer shall prepare a written decision, together with
the reasons therefore, within a reasonable time after the hearing. A copy of
the decision shall be served on the landlord and the tenant by one of the
methods set forth in subsection (a) above. A decision by the hearing officer
which denies the appeal in whole or in part shall not constitute a waiver of,
nor affect in any manner whatever, any rights a landlord or tenant may have to
a trial on the original merits or judicial review in any judicial proceedings,
which may thereafter be brought in the matter.
   (l)   The hearing officer's decision shall be limited to the question
whether the landlord is obligated under this section to begin eviction
proceedings against the tenant.
(Ord. 1829. Passed 2-12-24.)
1467.14 EXISTING MONTH-TO-MONTH TENANCIES; FUTURE ORAL LEASES.

addendum in writing within ninety days of such notice.

CHAPTER 1470 Registration of Foreclosing Mortgages and Vacant Property
1470.01   Purpose and intent.
1470.02   Definitions.
1470.03   Applicability and jurisdiction.
1470.04   Establishment of a registry.
1470.05   Inspection and registration of real property under foreclosure.
1470.06   Inspection and registration of vacant real property.
1470.07   Maintenance requirements.
1470.08   Security requirements.
1470.09   Provisions supplemental.

1470.11   Opposing, obstructing enforcement officer; penalty
1470.12   Immunity of Enforcement Officer
1470.13   Penalties
1470.01   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the Village Board to establish a process to
address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value of Village of Richton
Park neighborhoods caused by property with foreclosing or foreclosed mortgages
located within the Village of Richton Park, and to identify, regulate, limit
and reduce the number of these properties located within the Village of Richton
Park. It has been determined that owner-occupied structures are generally
better maintained when compared to vacant structures, even with a diligent off-
site property owner. Vacant structures or structures owned by individuals who
are economically strained and unable to meet their mortgage obligations are
often not properly or diligently maintained, which contribute to blight,
declined property values, and have a negative impact on social perception of
the residential areas where they are located. It is the Village Board's further
intent to establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect
neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance
of properties that are in foreclosure or foreclosed, and to provide a mechanism
to avert foreclosure actions through timely intervention, education, or
counseling of property owners.
(Ord. 1704. Passed 9-23-19; Ord. 1843. Passed 6-24-24.)
1470.02   DEFINITIONS.

that required registration.
   (l)   “Utilities and Services” shall mean any utility and/or service that is
essential for a building to be habitable and/or perform a service necessary to
comply with all Village of Richton Park codes. This includes, but is not
limited to, electrical, gas, water, sewer, lawn maintenance, pool maintenance,

   (c)   Within ten (10) days of the date any mortgagee files a foreclosure
action, the mortgagee shall register the real property with the Village of
Richton Park Registry, and, at the time of registration, indicate whether the

inspect, maintain, and secure the real property subject to the mortgage under a
foreclosure action. A separate registration is required for each property under
a foreclosure action, regardless of whether it is occupied or vacant.
   (d)   Initial registration pursuant to this section shall contain at a

each property. Subsequent non-refundable semi-annual renewal registrations of
properties and fees in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) are due
within ten (10) days of the expiration of the previous registration. Said fees
shall be used to offset the costs of: (1) registration and registration
enforcement; (2) code enforcement and mitigation related to defaulted
properties; (3) post-closing counseling and foreclosure intervention limited to

   (f)   Each individual property on the registry that has been registered for
twelve (12) months or more prior to the effective date shall have thirty (30)
days to renew the registration and pay the non-refundable five hundred dollar

registration fee.
   (g)   If the mortgage and/or servicing on a registrable property is sold or
transferred, the new mortgagee is subject to all the terms of this chapter.
Within ten (10) days of the transfer, the new mortgagee shall register the
property or update the existing registration. The previous mortgagee(s) will
not be released from the responsibility of paying all previous unpaid fees,
fines, and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's involvement with the
registrable property.
   (h)   If the mortgagee sells or transfers the registrable property in a non-
arm's length transaction to a related entity or person, the transferee is
subject to all the terms of this chapter. Within ten (10) days of the transfer,
the transferee shall register the property or update the existing registration.
Any and all previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties, regardless of who the
mortgagee was at the time registration was required, including, but not limited
to, unregistered periods during the foreclosure process, are the responsibility
of the transferee and are due and payable with the updated registration. The
previous mortgagee will not be released from the responsibility of paying all
previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's
involvement with the defaulted property.
   (i)   If the foreclosing or foreclosed property is not registered, or the
registration fee is not paid within thirty (30) days of when the registration
or renewal is required pursuant to this section, a late fee equivalent to ten
percent (10%) of the semi-annual registration fee shall be charged for every
thirty-day period (30), or portion thereof, the property is not registered and
shall be due and payable with the registration.
   (j)   This section shall also apply to properties that have been the subject
of a foreclosure sale where title is transferred to the mortgagee as well as
any properties transferred to the mortgagee under a deed in lieu of foreclosure
or by any other legal means.

annual registration requirement, and the inspection, security, and maintenance
standards of this section as long as the property remains registrable property.
   (l)   Failure of the mortgagee and/or property owner of record to properly
register or to modify the registration to reflect a change of circumstances as
required by this chapter is a violation of this chapter and shall be subject to
enforcement by any of the enforcement means available to the Village of Richton
Park.
   (m)   If any property is in violation of this chapter the Village of Richton
Park may take the necessary action to ensure compliance with and/or place a
lien on the property for the cost of the outstanding obligation and any
additional cost incurred to the property into compliance.

sensitive site planning to further the preservation of mature trees and natural
areas; to protect trees during construction; to facilitate site design and
construction which contribute to the long term viability of existing trees; to
control the removal of trees when necessary; and, to enable the Village of
Richton Park to receive and maintain designation as a Tree City USA.
   (b)   Planning and Zoning Commission. The Village of Richton Park Planning
and Zoning Commission (PZC), as established in Chapter 260 of the Village Code,
shall serve as the Tree Board. It shall be the responsibility of the Tree Board
to update and administer the Urban Forestry Management Plan (UFMP).
   (c)   Administrative Official.
      (1)   The Public Works Director or his designee shall serve as the
Administrative Official for this chapter and oversee the duties of any forestry
staff in the implementation of this chapter, the UFMP and in service to the

of the Standard of Care and shall direct the planting, maintenance, and removal
of all public trees in the Village.
      (3)   The Administrative Official shall achieve and maintain
certification as an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) Certified
Arborist.
   (d)   Urban Forestry Management Plan (UFMP). The Urban Forestry Management
Plan (UFMP) is a document that establishes arboricultural standards, methods
and priorities for the management of the urban forest of the Village. The UFMP
is adopted and amended by the Tree Board and administered by the Administrative
Official.
   (e)   Minimum Tree Program Budget. At the start of each fiscal year, the
Village shall budget at least two dollars ($2.00) per capita annually for the
restoration and upkeep of its urban forest. By way of example, if at the start
of a given fiscal year the Village has a population of 13,000 residents, then
the Village shall budget a minimum of twenty-six thousand dollars ($26,000)
($2.00 x 13,000) to be used for the following purposes:
      (1)   Educating the public on the benefits of conservation and
environmental preservation;
      (2)   Planting, maintaining, and managing trees and landscaping on public
property in the Village;
      (3)   Creating, restoring and expanding wooded property within the
Village;
      (4)   Purchasing of conservation easements and/or environmental
preserves; and
      (5)   Other purposes specifically described in this chapter.

   The Village hereby adopts the most current version of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) A300, Z133.1, and Z60.1 standards which, in concert
with this chapter and the UFMP, shall serve as the arboricultural standards of
care for all public trees, protected trees and any other trees regulated under
this chapter. In the administration of this tree management program, if there
is a conflict between this chapter, the Village Zoning Ordinance, the Village
Subdivision Ordinance, the UFMP and/or the aforementioned ANSI standards, then
the order of precedence shall be 1) this chapter, 2) the Village Zoning
Ordinance, 3) the Village Subdivision Ordinance, 4) the UFMP, and 3) the ANSI
standard.

disasters, including but not limited to, tornadoes, straight-line winds, ice
storms, fire, floods, hail, or lightning strikes, or through the independent
actions of third parties, the applicant shall be relieved of the responsibility
of replanting the tree or trees so affected.
      (2)   Requests for on-site mitigation.
         A.   Requests to mitigate on-site must be incorporated in the
applicant's TCA or TCP.
         B.   Plan requirements. The TCA or TCP must graphically represent the
species and location for all trees to be planted on-site. It shall also include
a chart clearly stating the following information:
            1.   The number of trees requested for removal;
            2.   The percentage below the minimum canopy requirement they
represent;
            3.   Tree removal due to the grading work done to create tie backs
for roads shall be pursuant to Section 11 of the Zoning Ordinance; and,
            4.   The species and number of trees to be planted.
         C.   Species selection. Species must be selected from the approved
species list and shall be based upon the amount of space available for proper
growth on the site, and must be approved by the Tree Board as part of the TCA
or TCP.
         D.   Placement of trees. The applicant is expected to plant trees in
locations on the site where the environmental benefits of canopy cover are most
likely to offset the impact of development. Trees shall not be placed within
utility easements, or in other locations where their future protection cannot
be assured.
         E.   On-site mitigation incentive. If all the required trees can be
located on-site, the Administrative Official may approve up to a twenty percent
reduction in the number of trees to be planted. Any incentive reductions
allowed shall be based upon the species of the mitigation trees and the space
needed for the healthy growth of trees.
      (3)   Request for off-site alternatives. Requests for off-site
alternatives must be incorporated in and submitted concurrently with the
applicant's TCA or TCP. The applicant may seek approval of the Administrative
Official to preserve an equal or greater amount of canopy cover at a site
within the Village limits.
      (4)   Off-site forestation. If off-site preservation cannot be achieved,
the applicant may seek approval from the Administrative Official to plant the
required number of trees on another site owned by the applicant and located
within the Village limits.
      (5)   Financial mitigation, tree planting and maintenance fee. When on-
site mitigation, off-site preservation and off-site forestation cannot
completely fulfill a developer's obligation under this chapter, the developer
shall pay the Village a planting and maintenance fee for each required tree
where such fee fairly represents the costs of material and labor to plant each
tree as well as three years of maintenance costs to ensure each tree survives
for that period of time.
         A.   An applicant which cannot achieve the requirements through
preservation or mitigation shall contribute to the Village. The Village shall
use the money paid to the Village to plant trees within the subdivision along
rights-of-ways, detention ponds, common areas or other areas where trees can be
protected and have a high probability of survival to a mature tree. This shall
be accomplished once the subdivision is built out or as approved by the
Administrative Official.
         B.   Money contributed in lieu of on-site mitigation or off-site
forestation shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit and prior to
final plat acceptance.
         C.   Money contributed under this section:
            1.   May be used for canopy mitigation, including planting site
identification, tree acquisition, planting, and maintenance, utilizing either
Village staff or contract labor;
            2.   Shall not revert to the general fund for ongoing operations.
         D.   Any refunds shall be paid to the applicant who made the original
contribution.
         E.   Notice of the right to a refund, including the amount of the
refund and the procedure for applying for and receiving the refund, shall be
sent or served in writing to the applicant no later than thirty days after the
date which the refund becomes due. The sending by regular mail of the notices
to the applicant shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of notice.
         F.   The refund shall be made on a pro rata basis, and shall be paid
in full no later than ninety days after the date certain upon which the refund
becomes due.
         G.   At the time of the contribution to the Village, the
Administrative Official shall provide the applicant with written notice of
those circumstances under which refunds of such fees will be made. Failure to
deliver such written notice shall not invalidate any contribution to the
Village under this chapter.
   (d)   Standards for Approval.
      (1)   A TCA/TCP shall be approved if it will preserve existing tree cover
in accordance with the percentage requirements established by Table 2.0. If not
in compliance with Table 2.0, the TCA/TCP shall be supplemented with a request
for mitigation as provided for in subsection (c) hereof.
   Table 2.0 - Existing Tree Cover Preservation Requirements
 
Percentage of existing tree cover on the Minimum percentage of existing tree
entire site                              cover to be preserved*

50.1% - 100%                             30%
*Minimum percentage of existing tree cover to be preserved shall exclude any
area in public rights-of way.
      (2)   The Administrative Official shall review the application for a TCA
or TCP and make a recommendation to the Tree Board. The Tree Board shall
approve the TCA or TCP if the Board finds that it:
         A.   Provides for the placement of building pads, parking areas,
driveways, streets, and utility easements so as to maximize the preservation of
environmental features of the property;
         B.   Maximizes the preservation of existing tree stands with the
potential to buffer residential areas from the noise, glare, and visual effects
of nonresidential uses;
         C.   Maximizes the preservation of trees adjoining a natural or man-
made drainage creek, if any;
         D.   Maximizes the preservation of existing protected trees; and
         E.   Mitigates the alteration of trees through tree replacement
procedures pursuant to this chapter.
   (e)   Action on TCA and TCP.
      (1)   An application that requires the submittal of either a TCA or a TCP
shall first be reviewed by the Administrative Official in conjunction with the
accompanying development application.
      (2)   The Administrative Official shall prepare and present a report to
the Tree Board that evaluates the extent to which the proposed development is
responsive to the approval criteria outlined in subsection (d) hereof and makes
a recommendation to the Tree Board for approval or denial of the TCA or TCP.
      (3)   The Tree Board shall approve the proposed TCA or TCP if it finds
that it meets the criteria outlined in subsection (d) hereof.

1472.08   TREE REPLACEMENT AND TREE PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Generally. Any protected or public tree required to be replaced under
this chapter shall be replaced with an equivalent tree as designated in the
UFMP and approved by the Administrative Official. The Administrative Official
will determine the time of replacement, and the location of the replacement
trees and assign the agent responsible for replacing the tree.
   (b)   Size and Number. A sufficient number of trees shall be planted to
equal or exceed the diameter, measured in DBH, of each tree altered. Each
replacement tree shall be at least two and one-half inches DBH.
   (c)   Location. Each replacement tree should be planted on the same lot or
tract as the tree which was altered. However, if the replacement tree cannot be
planted on the same lot or tract in accordance with the Village's Standard of
Care, the Administrative Official may authorize any or a combination of the
following:
      (1)   Replacement on other private property within the Village of Richton

      (3)   Payment to the Village as provided by Section
1472.07(c)(5).
   (d)   Time of Replacement. Any replacement trees required to be planted must
be planted not later than ninety days after the order of the Administrative
Official, or within thirty days of the date any appeal from such order becomes
final, provided, however, that the Administrative Official may require the
deferral of the planting of replacement trees up to an additional 180 days
based on weather and other arboreal considerations.
   (e)   Longevity and Duration. If a replacement tree dies within three years
from the date it was planted, the person subject to the requirement to plant
the replacement tree must replace the dead tree with another replacement tree
within ninety days of the order of the Administrative Official ordering such
replanting.
   (f)   Tree Protection Procedures. Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter,
any protected tree for which a permit is required shall comply with Section
7.15(B) of the Village Zoning Ordinance "Tree Protection During Construction

vegetation adjacent to the right-of- way, and shall promptly take action to
notify the Administrative Official and remove all dead, diseased or hazardous
trees, or broken or decayed limbs which may constitute a threat or danger to
the safety of the public. The land owner is not responsible for maintenance to
trees on the right-of-ways however, a private tree shall maintain a minimum
clearance of fourteen feet above the traveled pavement or curb of a public
street or as approved by the Administrative Official and a clearance of eight
feet above the surface of a sidewalk. Pruning techniques are outlined in the
UFMP.
   (b)   Tree Topping. Unless otherwise specified within this chapter, it shall
be a violation of this chapter for any person to severely cut back branches to
stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's canopy to such a
degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree.
(Ord. 1787. Passed 6-27-22.)

   (a)   Appeal of Administrative Interpretation or Decision.
      (1)   A person affected by an interpretation or decision of the
Administrative Official under this chapter may appeal to the Tree Board. Such
appeal must be received in writing within ten days after the interpretation or
decision has been rendered in writing and delivered to the property owner, or
within ten days of the postmark date if the decision was sent in U.S. Mail to
the property owner. The person shall file the appeal with the Administrative
Official and must describe both the decision being appealed and the specific
grounds on which the appeal is based.
      (2)   The Administrative Official shall then schedule a hearing of the
appeal at the next available Tree Board meeting and transmit all the documents
pertaining to the appeal to the Tree Board at a reasonable time prior to the
meeting. The Tree Board shall hear the appeal to determine whether the decision
of the Administrative Official was in accordance with this chapter and the
Standard of Care. The decision of the Tree Board shall be final and binding and
the applicant shall conform to the Tree Board's decision within thirty days.
   (b)   Variances.
      (1)   The Village Board may authorize a variance to any provision of this
chapter following a recommendation from the Tree Board.
      (2)   A person requesting a variance from the provisions of this chapter
shall do so in writing to the Administrative Official. A request for a variance
shall be accompanied by a TCA or TCP as required by Section

Administrative Official. All variance requests shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable filing fee in the amount specified in the current fee schedule
adopted by Village Board.
      (3)   Upon receipt of a written request for a variance and reasonable
supporting documentation, the Administrative Official shall then schedule a
hearing of the variance at the next available Tree Board meeting and transmit
all the documents pertaining to the appeal to the Tree Board.
      (4)   The Tree Board shall hear the variance and determine if it will
make a recommendation to the Village Board. The following factors shall be
considered in evaluating the variance request:
         A.   Whether a literal enforcement of the chapter will create an undue
hardship or an unreasonable practical difficulty on the applicant;
         B.   Whether the situation causing the unnecessary hardship or
practical difficulty is unique to the affected property and is not self-
imposed;
         C.   Whether a reasonable accommodation or alternative solution can be
made to accomplish the desired activity without the alteration of the tree;
         D.   Whether the variance will injure or be wholly compatible with the
use and future or existing development of adjacent properties;
         E.   Whether the increased development costs caused by preserving the
tree create an undue hardship on the development of the site;
         F.   Whether there is any identified adverse effect of the alteration
or preservation on erosion, soil moisture retention, flow of surface water, and
drainage systems;
         G.   Whether there is any substantial impact to the buffering of
residential areas from the noise, glare, and visual effects of non-residential
uses;
         H.   The costs versus the benefits of relocating required utility
service infrastructure and easements based on preservation or alteration of
protected trees;
         I.   Whether the proposed tree replacement procedures adequately
mitigate the alteration of the tree;
         J.   Whether the alteration adversely affects the public health,
safety or welfare; and
         K.   Whether the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
spirit and purpose of this chapter to the greatest degree reasonably possible.
      (5)   Upon the Tree Board's recommendation to the Village Board, the
Administrative Official shall then schedule consideration of the variance at
the next available Village Board meeting and transmit all the documents
pertaining to the variance. The Village Board shall then hear the variance to
determine whether it should be granted or denied. The Board shall consider the
same factors in Section 16.2(d) of the Zoning Code in its evaluation of the
variance request.
      (6)   The decision of the Village Board with respect to any application
for a variance.

finds in any building combustible or explosive matter or flammable conditions
dangerous to the safety of such building or the occupants thereof, he or she
shall order such dangerous conditions or materials to be removed or remedied.
Such order shall forthwith be complied with by the owner or occupant of such
premises or building. If such order is made by the Chief Inspector of the
