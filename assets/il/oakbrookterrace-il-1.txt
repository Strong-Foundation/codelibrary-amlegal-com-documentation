a red light signal violation or expired registration;
      (9)   A warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty or request a
hearing to contest liability within 14 days of the mailing of the notice of
violation is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the
driving privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the motor vehicle in
addition to other specified penalties for failing to appear at the hearing or
pay the fine in advance of the hearing;
      (10)   A statement that the registered owner or lessee of the motor

hearing.
      (11)   The website address, accessible through the internet, at which the
alleged violator may view the recorded images.
   (J)   Review of recorded images.
      (1)   Before an automated traffic law violation notice may be issued for
any automated traffic law violation, a determination must be made by the
technician, based on inspection of recorded images generated by the automated
traffic law enforcement device, that the motor vehicle was being operated in
manner that resulted in an automated traffic law violation. If the technician
determines that an automated traffic law violation occurred, the technician
shall forward the recorded images to the review technician. If the technician
determines that the motor vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral
procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or
that an automated traffic law violation did not occur, an automated traffic law
violation notice shall not be issued.
      (2)   Before an automated traffic law violation notice may be issued for
any automated traffic law violation, the determination of the technician that
based on inspection of recorded images generated by the automated traffic law
enforcement device, the motor vehicle was being operated in manner that
resulted in an automated traffic law violation must be reviewed and approved by
the review technician. If the review technician, after review of the
technician's determination, approves the determination that an automated
traffic law violation occurred, the review technician shall authorize the
issuance of the automated traffic law violation notice. If the review
technician, after review of the technician's determination, determines that an
automated traffic law violation did not occur, an automated traffic law
violation notice shall not be issued.
      (3)   The city shall make the recorded images accessible to be viewed by
the alleged violator at a website address, accessible through the internet.
      (4)   Recorded images made by the city's automated traffic law
enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the
alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of
adjudicating an automated traffic law violation, for statistical purposes, or
for other governmental purposes, Any recorded image evidencing an automated
traffic law violation, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting
from the issuance of the automated traffic law violation notice.
   (K)   Right to a hearing. The registered owner or lessee of the motor
vehicle cited in a parking violation notice, compliance violation notice or
automated traffic law violation notice shall have the opportunity for a hearing

which they may be represented by counsel at their expense, present witnesses,
and cross-examine opposing witnesses. Parties may request that the
Administrative Hearing Officer issue subpoenas to direct the attendance and
testimony of a relevant witness and/or for the production of relevant

provided that the notice of violation correctly sets forth the necessary

      (13)   The Administrative Hearing Officer may consider in defense of an
automated traffic law violation the following:

vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of
or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
         (b)   That the driver of the motor vehicle passed through the
intersection when the light was red either:
            1.   In order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle;
            2.   As part of a funeral procession; or
            3.   At the direction of a law enforcement officer; and
         (c)   Evidence that the traffic signal was not operating properly at
the time of the violation;
         (d)   Any other evidence that the violation set forth in the automated
traffic law violation notice did not occur.
      (14)   To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates
were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or
possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit
proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates
was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
      (15)   Upon the conclusion of a hearing, the Administrative Hearing
Officer shall issue a final determination of "liable" or "not liable." Upon

following:
         (a)   The failure to request a hearing on the merits of the violation
in the time and manner specified on the violation notice and pay the fine
indicated on the violation notice by the deadline stated on the violation
notice; or
         (b)   The failure by a person requesting a hearing to attend the
hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a
prior mailed notice and the Hearing Officer's determination of violation
liability, followed by:
            1.   The denial of a timely petition to set aside that
determination; or
            2.   Upon expiration of the period for filing such a petition
without a filing having been made; or
         (c)   The failure to pay the fine or penalty after an Administrative
Hearing Officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or
failure to exhaust any administrative or judicial review procedures provided by
this section.
      (2)   No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a
written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated traffic law violation
involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon
the request of the city received within 120 days after the automated traffic
law violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt

five or more automated traffic law violations under § 11-208.6 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code may challenge the accuracy of a certified report by submitting to
the Traffic Compliance Administrator a written statement under oath, together
with any supporting documentation, establishing one of the following grounds
for challenging the accuracy of the certified report:
         (a)   That the person was not the owner or lessee of the motor vehicle
or vehicles receiving ten or more parking violations under § 6-306.5 of the
Illinois Vehicle Code, ten or more compliance violations under § 11-208.6 of

Vehicle Code indicated on the certified report.
      (2)   The written statement and the supporting documentation must be sent
to the Traffic Compliance Administrator by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal delivery to the Traffic Compliance Administrator
within ten days after the person receives notice from the Secretary of State
that the person's driver's license will be suspended at the end of a specified
period of time. The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall render a written
determination within 14 days of receipt of the written statement and the
supporting documentation challenging the certified report. Upon rendering a
decision, the Traffic Compliance Administrator shall send a copy of the written
decision to the person challenging the certified report by first class United
States mail, postage prepaid. If the grounds for challenging the accuracy of
the certified report have been established, the Traffic Compliance
Administrator shall notify the Secretary of State unless the Secretary of State
is presented with a notice from the city certifying that the fines or penalties
due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's name on the
certified report was in error.
   (U)   Procedure for non-residents; contests by mail. Non-residents of the
city and persons that desire to challenge the determination of liability
without attending a hearing may contest the merits of a violation without
attending a hearing by submitting to the Traffic Compliance Administrator a

setting forth the reasons why a determination of liability should not be
entered. The written statement and the supporting documentation must be sent to
the Traffic Compliance Administrator by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by personal delivery to the Traffic Compliance Administrator
within ten days after the person receives the violation notice. The Traffic
Compliance Administrator shall forward to the Administrative Hearing Officer
the violation notice, the written statement under oath of the person
challenging the determination of liability, together with any supporting
documentation, setting forth the reasons why a determination of liability
should not be entered and any evidence which the city may possess setting forth
the basis why a determination of liability should be entered. For parking
violations and compliance violations only, the Administrative Hearing Officer
shall render a written determination within 14 days of receipt of the written
statement and the supporting documentation setting forth the reasons why a
determination of liability should not be entered. For automated traffic law
violations, the Administrative Hearing Officer shall render a written
determination within 30 days of receipt of the written statement and supporting
documentation setting forth the reasons why a determination of liability should

      (1)   The fine for unlawful parking in a handicapped zone shall be $250.

additional penalty of $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely
manner shall be assessed.
      (2)   The fine for unauthorized use of disability or disabled veteran
license plates, parking decal or device for parking a motor vehicle shall be
$500 for the first offense, $750 for the second offense and $1,000 for a third

      (3)   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle cited for an automated
traffic law violation received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer
at the time of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a
civil penalty of $100 per violation. If the civil penalty is not paid within 25
days following the issuance of a notice of final determination of an automated
traffic law violation, an additional penalty of $100 for failure to pay the
original penalty in a timely manner shall be assessed. Unless the driver of the
motor vehicle cited for an automated traffic law violation received a uniform
traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, a
violation for which a civil penalty is imposed for an automated traffic law
violation is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of
motor vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of
the motor vehicle.
      (4)   The fine for failure to wear a seat safety belt shall be $25. If
the fine is not paid within seven days following the issuance of a notice of
final determination of liability for a parking violation, an additional penalty

assessed.
      (5)   The fine for all other parking violations shall be $15. If the fine

determination of liability for a parking violation, an additional penalty of

assessed.
      (6)   The fine for all compliance violations shall be $120. If the fine
is not paid within seven days following the issuance of a notice of final
determination of liability for a parking violation, an additional penalty of
$10 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner shall be
assessed. Unless released on a written promise to comply, a person charged with
a compliance violation and personally served with a compliance violation notice
shall post bail in the amount of $120 in one of the following ways:
         (a)   By depositing, in lieu of such amount, a current Illinois
driver's license; or
         (b)   By depositing, in lieu of such amount, an approved bond

      (2)   The person determined to be liable for the five or more violations
is the registered owner of a motor vehicle that is located within the corporate

      (3)   A notice of impending vehicle immobilization has been sent to the
registered owner of the motor vehicle, by first class United States mail,

determined to be liable, which shall include for each violation:
            1.   The vehicular parking violation, compliance violation or

United States mail.
      (2)   At the hearing, the registered owner of the motor vehicle may

Administrator set forth in the notice of impending vehicle immobilization in a
timely manner, fails to appear at the hearing after having requested a hearing
or fails to successfully contest the liability of the registered owner of the
motor vehicle for the unpaid final determinations listed on the notice of

be had and how the registered owner may obtain an immobilization hearing.
      (2)   In addition, the Traffic Compliance Administrator shall serve a
post-immobilization/ towing notice upon the registered owner of a motor vehicle
immobilized or towed and impounded sent by first class United States mail,
postage prepaid, at the address recorded with the Secretary of State, or if any
post-immobilization/towing notice to that address is returned as undeliverable,

      (4)   The failure to request a hearing or attend a scheduled hearing
shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing. In the event of such
failure, any amounts deposited pursuant to §
10.20(AA) shall be forfeited. A hearing provided pursuant to this section shall

into the impounded motor vehicles.
   (EE)   Judicial review.
      (1)   Any final decision by an Administrative Hearing Officer that a code
violation does or does not exist shall constitute a final determination for
purposes of judicial review unless a timely petition to set aside final
determination of a parking violation, compliance violation, or automated
traffic law violation has been filed with the Traffic Compliance Administrator,
in which case the written decision of the Traffic Compliance Administrator
upholding the final decision of the Administrative Hearing Officer shall
constitute a final determination for purposes of judicial review. The
Administrative Hearing Officer's or the Traffic Compliance Administrator's
decision, as the proper case may be, shall be subject to review under the
Illinois Administrative Review Law (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-103 et seq.).

under this section has failed to comply with a judgment ordering such person to
correct a violation of the city's code or imposing any fine or other sanction
as a result of such a violation, any expenses incurred by the city to enforce
the judgment entered against such person, including, but not limited to,
attorney's fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or
foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing the city after they are fixed by a
court of competent jurisdiction or hearing officer, and may be collected in
accordance with applicable law. Prior to any expenses being fixed by the
Administrative Hearing Officer pursuant to this division, the city shall
provide a notice to such person that requires his or her appearance at a
hearing before the Administrative Hearing Officer to determine whether such
person has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice shall set the date
for such hearing, which shall not be less than seven days from the date that
notice is served. Notice of the hearing shall be served as provided by division
(E)(2) of this section.
      (4)   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article XII of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 12-101 et seq.) or by
the Uniform Commercial Code (ILCS Ch. 810, Act 5, §§ 1-101 et seq.) a lien
shall be imposed on the violator's real estate or personal estate, or both, in
the amount of any debt due and owing the city under this section. The lien may
be enforced in the same manner as a judgment lien pursuant to a judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
      (5)   Upon a petition filed by the person against whom a judgment was
entered, within 30 days after the issuance of the order of default, the
Administrative Hearing Officer may set aside any judgment entered by default
and set a new hearing date, if the Administrative Hearing Officer determines
that such person's failure to appear at the hearing was for good cause, or at
any time if such person establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the city did not provide proper service of process for the notice of violation
or complaint. If any judgment is set aside pursuant to this division (FF)(5) as
a result of a vacated default judgment, the Administrative Hearing Officer
shall have authority to enter an order extinguishing any lien that has been
recorded for any debt due and owing the city. When a judgment is vacated, the
Administrative Hearing Officer shall set a new date for a hearing on the merits
of the underlying violation(s).

or other entity recognized in law who violates any provision of the ordinances
of the city for which another penalty is not specifically provided shall, upon
conviction, be subject to a fine of not less than $75 nor more than $750. Each

   (B)   In addition to or in lieu of any fine or penalty imposed pursuant to

this code, for a violation of such an ordinance or provision of this code, a
court may enter a disposition of supervision upon a plea of guilty, upon a
stipulation by the defendant as to the facts supporting the charge, or upon a
finding of guilty by the court. Pursuant to such disposition of supervision,
the court shall defer entering any judgement on the charges until the
conclusion of the period of supervision. At the conclusion of the period of
supervision, if the court determines that the defendant has successfully
complied with all of the conditions of supervision, the court shall discharge
the defendant and enter a judgment dismissing the charges. At the conclusion of
the period of supervision, if the court determines that the defendant has not
successfully complied with all the conditions of supervision, the court shall
impose a penalty appropriate for the violation in accordance with the
provisions of the pertinent city ordinance or provision of this code. For
purposes of this section SUPERVISION shall mean a disposition of conditional
and revocable release, without probationary supervision, but under such
conditions and reporting requirements as are imposed by the court, at the
successful conclusion of which disposition, the defendant is discharged and a
judgment dismissing the charges is entered.

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants to the City of Oakbrook Terrace
that no individual who is a public officer or employee has any ownership
interest in the entity making this application or in the real estate which is
the subject of this application, nor are any such individuals an officer,
director, or employee of the entity making the application. If the foregoing
representation is inaccurate, the undersigned hereby states the nature of any
interest and the name of any such individual who is an officer, director, or
employee of the applicant or who has an ownership interest in the applicant
entity or in the real estate, which is the subject of this application.
The applicant shall swear to the above statement before a notary public or
other appropriate officer authorized to administer oaths in the State of
Illinois. Any public officer or employee who receives an application which

interest in the applicant entity or in the real estate which is the subject of
the application, shall immediately forward a copy of such statement to the
office of the City Attorney, who shall promptly notify the City Council of any
person named by the applicant in response to the foregoing inquiry. In addition

application, and knows, or should have known upon reasonable inquiry that the

or personal property, or services, or any other thing or item of value, whether
in the form of money, services, loans, travel, entertainment, discounts,
hospitality, offers of employment, or forgiveness of debt or obligation. If the
applicant is unable to truthfully make such representation, the applicant shall
state the name and the nature of the gift made to any such individual who is a
public officer or employee and the date of the gift. If any person executes an
application knowing that the statements set forth therein, or any part thereof,
are false, it shall also be grounds for denial of the application, and such
person shall be deemed in violation of this subchapter and subject to the
penalties set forth herein.

§ 30.46 WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY.
   (A)   Intent. The Whistleblower Policy (the Policy) is intended to enable
employees, elected and appointed officials, residents, suppliers, customers,
and others to raise concerns regarding alleged fraudulent acts or related
misconduct, anonymously or otherwise, without retaliation or, in the case of an
employee, adverse employment consequences. The Policy is based on the
Whistleblower Act of the State of Illinois (ILCS Ch. 740, Act 174, §§ 1, et
seq. (the Act)).
   (B)   Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have
the meanings ascribed to them herein, unless the context clearly indicates that
a different meaning is intended.
      FRAUDULENT ACTS. Include any intentional act or omission designed to
deceive others, resulting in the victim suffering a loss, and/or the
perpetrator achieving a gain.
      RETALIATION or any threat of retaliation against any official, employee,
resident, supplier, customer or other person for disclosure of a fraudulent act
or related misconduct or refusal to participate in unlawful activity is
expressly prohibited by the Act.
   (C)   Reporting retaliation. Employees who believe that they have been
retaliated against for reporting fraudulent acts or related misconduct should
advise the City Attorney in writing. The City Attorney shall take appropriate
action to investigate and address complaints of retaliation.
   (D)   Any individual reporting alleged fraudulent acts or related misconduct
must act in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the
information disclosed provides evidence of an improper transaction or a
violation of the law or administrative policies.
   (E)   Making allegations maliciously, recklessly, or with the foreknolwledge
that the allegations were false, will be viewed as a serious offense and may
result in penalties as provided by the city’s personnel policies or applicable
Illinois law.
   (F)   A key factor in the detection of fraudulent acts or related misconduct
is educating elected and appointed officials, employees, residents, suppliers,
customers, and others to recognize fraudulent acts or related misconduct that
may occur. For this reason, the city will, to the extent it considers
practical, provide training and education concerning the whistleblower policy.
   (G)   An appointed official, employee, resident, supplier, customer or other
person may report a possible fraudulent act or related misconduct, anonymously
or otherwise, in any of the following ways:
      (1)   Download the Suspected Fraud form from the city’s website at
oakbrookterrace.net and mail the completed form to the City Attorney at 17W275
Butterfield Road, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181; and

informed of the outcome of the investigation by the Office of the City
Attorney.

immediately disqualified, and returned unopened to the bidder, if feasible. If
a bid or proposal is properly received by the office of the City Administrator,
the individual accepting the bid or proposal shall note the date and time that
the bid was received and sign his or her name. All bids or proposals shall be
kept in a secure location in an office designated by the City Administrator.
   (C)   Holding and returning bids. Bids or proposals shall not be unsealed
and examined until the date and time specified for opening, provided, that

officers shall be trained under the Intergovernmental Law Enforcement Officer's
In-Service Training Act in accordance with the procedures for part-time police
officers established by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board.
A part-time police officer who has not yet received certification under Section
8.2 of the Illinois Police Training Act shall be directly supervised at all
times by a law enforcement officer certified by the Illinois Law Enforcement
Training Standards Board. Direct supervision shall include oversight and
control with the supervisor having final decision making authority as to the
actions of the probationary part-time police officer during duty hours. A
person hired to serve as a part-time police officer must obtain from the
Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board a certificate (i) attesting
to his or her successful completion of the part-time police training course;
(ii) attesting to his or her satisfactory completion of a training program of
similar content and number of hours that has been found acceptable by the
Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board under the provisions of the
Illinois Police Training Act; or (iii) attesting to the Illinois Law
Enforcement Training Standards Board's determination that the part-time police
training course is unnecessary because of the person's extensive prior law
enforcement experience. A part-time police officer who is hired and who has not
yet received certification under Section 8.2 of the Illinois Police Training
Act hired must obtain this certificate within 18 months after the initial date
of hire. A part-time police officer who has not yet received certification
under Section 8.2 of the Illinois Police Training Act must be enrolled and
accepted into a Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board approved
course within six months after active employment by the city. The city may seek
a waiver from the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board extending
the period for compliance. A part-time police officer who has not yet received
certification under Section 8.2 of the Illinois Police Training Act may not
practice as a part-time police officer during the waiver period. If training is
required and not completed within the applicable time period, as extended by
any waiver that may be granted, then the part-time police officer shall forfeit
his or her position. Before being permitted to carry a firearm, however, a
part-time police officer must have the same course of training as required of
peace officers under Section 2 of the Peace Officer Firearm Training Act.
Training required by Section 2 of the Peace Officer Firearm Training Act must
be completed by a part-time police officer within six months from the date of
the part-time police officer's initial employment.
   (K)   Line of duty compensation. The Line of Duty Compensation Act shall be

extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other
municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other

constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect
the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or
privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in
the manner prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this subchapter
shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if
unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for
such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the
taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
Department in the manner provided by the Department.

show the Department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this subchapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the Department may reasonably require.
   (B)   Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
Department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   (C)   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege
of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made
tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an
active resale number from the Department and furnishes that number to the
retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such
person is non- taxable because of being a sale for resale.

§ 35.995 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not
received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the
City Administrator or a designee, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application
with the city for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along
with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the
application but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before
the date the application was filed, however, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the
underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and
interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the city, however,
any additional amounts owed as a result of the underpayment of tax and interest
previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final
determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed
or the date agreed to by the city, whichever is longer.

§ 35.996 PUBLICATION OF TAX ORDINANCES.

requirement. Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the public
upon request at the City Clerk's office.
(Ord. 06-14, passed 9-12-06)
§ 35.997 INTERNAL REVIEW OF LIENS.
   The City Administrator or a designee shall establish an internal review
procedure regarding any liens filed against taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the city that the lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full
force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the City
Administrator or a designee shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

§ 36.04 PAID LEAVE FOR ALL WORKERS ACT.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the city's Personnel Policy and Procedures
Manual, as amended, which was adopted on May 14, 2002, by Ord. 02-06; and the
agreement between the City of Oakbrook Terrace and the Illinois Fraternal Order
of Police which was approved November 23, 2021, require the city to give
therein-described paid leave to city employees and anticipates that the city's
Personnel Policy and Procedures Manual, as amended, and the agreement between
the City of Oakbrook Terrace and the Illinois Fraternal Order of Police will
remain in effect on and after January 1, 2024, the effective date of the Paid
Leave for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.). Therefore,
pursuant to § 15(p) of the Paid Leave for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act
192, § 15(p)) the provisions of the Paid Leave for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch.
820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.) do not apply to the city.
   (B)   In the event that the city's Personnel Policy and Procedures Manual,
as amended, and/or the agreement between the City of Oakbrook Terrace and the
Illinois Fraternal Order of Police are not in effect on or after January 1,
2024, the effective date of the Paid Leave for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820,
Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.), and to the extent that any provision of the Paid Leave
for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.) thereby applies to
the city, the City Council determines that the provisions of the Paid Leave for
All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.) shall not apply to the
city, as a municipal employer. The city and all of its employees are hereby
exempted and excluded from the application of the Paid Leave for All Workers
Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.). The city hereby affirms, ratifies
and adopts its current leave policies for its employees as set forth in the
city's Personnel Policy and Procedures Manual and any collective bargaining
agreements to which the city is a party, as the same may be amended from time-
to-time. This section governs over and supersedes all provisions of the Paid
Leave for All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.) impacting the
employment relationship between the city and its employees. This section, once
adopted, shall apply to all employees of the city, provided, however, that
nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the validity or change the
terms of currently existing collective bargaining agreements to which the city
is a party. No additional obligations with regard to mandatory paid leave,
including, without limitation, any obligations imposed by the Paid Leave for
All Workers Act (ILCS Ch. 820, Act 192, §§ 1 et seq.), shall apply to the city
in its capacity as an employer, except those required by federal or State of
Illinois laws and regulations preempting the city's home rule authority.

which return for the applicable period was due or (ii) the end of the calendar
year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
   (E)   Notwithstanding anything in any tax ordinance to the contrary no
limitations period shall apply if the taxpayer attempting to assert the
limitations period files a fraudulent tax return.
(Ord. 00-45, passed 1-23-01)
§ 37.14 VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.
   (A)   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has
not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from
the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with
the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due.
   (B)   A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay
the amount of tax due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods
prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the
date of filing the application.
   (C)   A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be
liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed, provided the taxpayer correctly determined and
paid the amount of tax due. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and
underpaid the amount of the tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
   (D)   The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the local tax administrator. Any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be
paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all
appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer.
(Ord. 00-45, passed 1-23-01)
§ 37.15 PUBLICATION OF TAX RELATED CITY ORDINANCES.
   Any locally imposed and administered tax ordinance shall be published in
accordance with the Act. The local tax administrator is authorized to publish
tax ordinances via normal and standard publishing methods and, further, to post
tax ordinances on the Internet in order to satisfy the publication
requirements. Copies of all tax ordinances shall be made available to the
public upon request at the City Clerk's office.
(Ord. 00-45, passed 1-23-01)
§ 37.16 INTERNAL REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure
regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien
shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be
improper, the local tax administrator shall:
   (A)   Timely remove the lien at the city's expense;
   (B)   Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
   (C)   Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
(Ord. 00-45, passed 1-23-01)
§ 37.17 APPLICATION.
   This chapter shall be liberally construed and administered to supplement all
of the city's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax ordinance is in
conflict with or inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall be
controlling.

of the county, state and federal governments whenever possible, and which plan
and program may include:
         a.   Mitigation of disease, injury and damage caused by emergency;
         b.   Prompt and effective response to emergency;

emergency assistance to victims in the case of such emergency;
      (10)   Procure such services, supplies, equipment or material as may be
necessary for such purposes in view of the emergency, without regard to
statutory procedures or formalities normally prescribed by law pertaining to
municipal contracts or obligations and to let contracts to the extent necessary
to resolve such emergency without public advertisement or compliance with the
provisions of Chapter 30 of the Code of Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois;
      (11)   In collaboration with other public agencies within the immediate
vicinity, develop or cause to be developed mutual aid arrangements for
reciprocal emergency response and recovery assistance in the event that the
response to the emergency exceeds City resources;
      (12)   Order the quarantine, isolation or evacuation of all or part of
the population from any stricken or threatened area within the City provided,
however that:
         a.   During the period of time that a state of emergency exists due to
the outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of a dangerously contagious or infectious
disease, the Mayor shall have general supervision of the interests of the
health and lives of the people of the City. The Mayor shall have supreme
authority within the City in matters of quarantine, isolation, the closure of
businesses or operations within the City, but such orders shall only be more
restrictive than orders issued by the federal government, the Illinois Governor
or the Illinois Department of Public Health when such authority is necessary to
address an issue pertaining to the City's government or affairs relating to the
outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of a dangerously contagious or infectious
disease. The Mayor may declare and enforce quarantine, isolation, the closure
of businesses or operations within the City when none exists, and may modify or
relax the Mayor's quarantine, isolation, the closure of businesses or
operations within the City when it has been established. The Mayor may adopt,
promulgate, repeal and amend rules and regulations not less restrictive than
the rules and regulations issued by the federal government, the Illinois
Governor or the Illinois Department of Public Health relating to the outbreak,
epidemic or pandemic of a dangerously contagious or infectious disease. The
Mayor may make such investigations and inspections as it may from time to time
deem necessary for the preservation and improvement of the public health,
consistent with law regulating the outbreak, epidemic or pandemic of a
dangerously contagious or infectious disease.
         b.   The Mayor shall investigate the causes of dangerously contagious
or infectious diseases especially when existing in epidemic or pandemic form.
The Mayor shall take means to restrict and suppress dangerously contagious or
infectious diseases. Whenever such disease becomes, or threatens to become,
epidemic in the City and the Illinois Governor or the Illinois Department of
Public Health neglects or refuses to enforce efficient measures for its
restriction or suppression within the City or to act with sufficient promptness
or efficiency, or whenever the Illinois Governor or the Illinois Department of
Public Health neglects or refuses to promptly enforce efficient measures for
the restriction or suppression of dangerously contagious or infectious diseases
within the City, or, whenever the Illinois Governor or the Illinois Department
of Public Health's measures for the restriction or suppression of dangerously
contagious or infectious diseases present circumstances within the City that
threaten public health or safety within the City, the Mayor may issue such
Executive Orders and enforce such measures as the Mayor deems necessary to
protect the public health or safety. All necessary expenses so incurred shall
be paid by the City.
         c.   Subject to the provisions of subsection d, the Mayor may order a
person or group of persons to be quarantined or isolated or may order a place
or operations being conducted within the City to be closed and made off limits
to the public to prevent the probable spread of a dangerously contagious or
infectious disease until such time as the condition can be corrected or the
danger to the public health eliminated or reduced in such a manner that no
substantial danger to the public's health any longer exists.
         d.   Except as provided in this ordinance, no person or a group of
persons may be ordered to be quarantined or isolated and no place may be
ordered to be closed and made off limits to the public except with the consent
of the person or owner of the place or upon the consent of the City Council.
The Mayor may, however, order a person or a group of persons to be quarantined
or isolated or may order a place to be closed and made off limits to the public
on an immediate basis without prior consent of the owner or consent of the City
Council if, in the reasonable judgment of the Mayor, immediate action is
required to protect the public from a dangerously contagious or infectious
disease. In the event of an immediate order issued without prior consent of
owner or of the City Council, the Mayor shall, as soon as practical, within 48
hours after issuing the order, obtain the consent of the person or owner or
file a petition with the City Council requesting that it convene a special
meeting within 72 hours to consider consenting to the Mayor's order authorizing
the isolation or quarantine or closure. When exigent circumstances exist that
cause the City Council to be unavailable or that make it impossible to obtain
consent or file a petition within 48 hours after issuance of an immediate
order, the Mayor must obtain consent or file a petition requesting that the
City Council convene a special meeting as soon as reasonably possible. To
obtain the City Council's consent to the Mayor's order, the Mayor, by clear and
convincing evidence, must persuade the City Council that the public's health
and welfare are significantly endangered by a person or group of persons that
has, that is suspected of having, that has been exposed to, or that is
reasonably believed to have been exposed to a dangerously contagious or
infectious disease or by a place where there is a significant amount of
activity likely to spread a dangerously contagious or infectious disease. The
Mayor must also present facts to persuade the City Council that all other
reasonable means of correcting the problem have been exhausted and no less
restrictive alternative exists. For purposes of this ordinance, in determining
whether a no less restrictive alternative exists, the City Council shall
consider evidence showing that, under the circumstances presented by the case
in which an order is sought, quarantine, isolation or closure is the measure
provided for in an Executive Order of the Governor, an order or rule of the
Illinois Department of Public Health or in guidelines issued by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organization or arises from
such order, rule or guidelines and that the Mayor's order is necessary to
protect the public health or safety within the City. Persons who are ordered to
be isolated or quarantined or who are owners of places that are ordered to be
closed and made off limits to the public, shall be given a written notice of
such order. The written notice shall additionally include the following:
            (1)   Notice of the right to counsel;
            (2)   Notice that if the person or owner is indigent, the court
will appoint counsel for that person or owner;
            (3)   Notice of the reason for the order for isolation, quarantine,
or closure;
            (4)   Notice of whether the order is an immediate order, and if so,
the time frame for the Mayor to seek consent or to file a petition requesting
the City Council convene a special meeting within 72 hours as set out in this
ordinance; and
            (5)   Notice of the anticipated duration of the isolation,
quarantine, or closure.
            If a special meeting of the City Council is convened to consider
the consent to the Mayor's order, the person(s) who are or are about to be
ordered to be isolated or quarantined and owner(s) of places that are or are
about to be closed and made off limits to the public shall be given a written
notice of the time and place of the special City Council meeting. Persons who
are or are about to be ordered to be isolated or quarantined and owners of
places that are or are about to be closed and made off limits to the public
shall have the right to appear before the City Council and present evidence or
testimony and shall have the right to counsel. If a person or owner is
indigent, the City Council shall appoint counsel for that person or owner. The
determination of the City Council regarding its consent to the Mayor's Order
shall be a final administrative decision of the City.
      (13)   Prescribe the route, modes of transportation and destinations in
connection with evacuation;
      (14)   Control ingress and egress to and from a disaster area, the
movement of persons within the area and the occupancy of premises therein;
      (15)   Order the restriction of vehicle movement, except fire, police,
hospital services, utilities vehicles and physicians on emergency cases, within
such geographical areas of the City or to the City as a whole as the Mayor
deems reasonably necessary to respond to the emergency;
      (16)   Make provisions for the availability and use of temporary
emergency housing;
      (17)   Other orders. Issue such other orders as are imminently necessary
for the protection of life and property.
   (D)   Term of proclamation. The proclamation herein authorized shall be
effective for a period of seven days unless sooner terminated by a proclamation
of the Mayor or by a resolution of the City Council determining that the civil
emergency no longer exists. Provided that the proclamation of the civil
emergency has not sooner been terminated, the Mayor, with the consent of the
City Council, shall have the power to re-proclaim the existence of a civil
emergency at the end of the initial seven-day period during the time the civil
emergency exists. The City Council shall provide in the ordinance or resolution
consenting to the re-proclamation of the existence of a civil emergency the
period of time during which the Mayor's proclamation shall continue without
seeking additional consent from the City Council.
   (E)   Media to be notified. Upon the issuance of the proclamation identified
herein, the Emergency Management Coordinator or his or her designee shall
notify the news media situated within the city, and shall cause copies of the
proclamation declaring the existence of the emergency to be posted at the
following places within the city:
      (1)   City Hall;
      (2)   Police Station;
      (3)   The Fire Station of the Oakbrook Terrace Fire Protection District.
   (F)   The operation of the language of this chapter and the exercise of the
powers by the Mayor provided in this chapter is not dependent upon a
declaration of an emergency or disaster by the Governor pursuant to the
Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act but are dependent up on the
declaration of an emergency by the Mayor.

§ 50.05 (RESERVED).
§ 50.06 DISCHARGE OF STORMWATER; CONNECTION TO A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE STORMWATER
COLLECTION SYSTEM.
   (A)   Sump pumps used to drain basements and footing drain tiles shall
discharge in the following manner:
      (1)   Through a 1¼-inch-minimum-diameter discharge pipe to the outside of
the basement, at a distance of not less than 18 inches beyond the foundation
wall, and not less than 10 feet from the property line of adjacent property
owners, to the surface of the ground; or
      (2)   To a public or private stormwater collection system, if available.
Connection to a public stormwater collection system is mandatory if the public
stormwater collection system is located within a reasonable distance from the
property utilizing the sump pump to drain basements and footing drain tile, and
if the public stormwater collection system has the capacity to convey the
discharge as determined by the Office of the City Engineer or its designee; or
      (3)   When the public stormwater collection system is not within a
reasonable distance from the property utilizing a sump pump to drain basements
and footing drain tiles, or when the public stormwater collection system does
not have the capacity to convey the discharge, as determined by the Office of
the City Engineer or its designee, then the discharging property will be
required to make reasonable efforts to manage the discharge on-site so as not
to allow water to collect unreasonably on adjacent properties. REASONABLE
EFFORTS shall include the construction of drywells, rain gardens, cisterns, or
other such measures as determined to be acceptable by the Office of the City
Engineer or its designee.
   (B)   Sump pumps shall not discharge into any public stormwater collection
system unless such system is designed to convey the discharge as determined by
the Office of the City Engineer or its designee. Sump pump and downspout
connections to a waterway determined to be within a Special Flood Hazard Area
require the issuance of a stormwater permit in accordance with Chapter152 of
this code.
   (C)   No connection to a private stormwater collection system shall be
permitted from any downspout draining stormwater from the roof of a building or
structure unless it has the capacity to convey the discharge as determined by
the Office of the City Engineer or its designee.
   (D)   No connection to the city’s stormwater collection system shall be made
without first obtaining a permit approved by the Office of the City Engineer or
its designee.
   (E)   No more than one connection shall be permitted to the city’s
stormwater collection system for ground water seepage from a building drain
tile system.
   (F)   Building downspouts or downspout pipelines that discharge to the
ground surface shall discharge no less than ten feet from the property line of
adjacent property owners.

§ 51.02 CONSTRUCTION SITE DEBRIS MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Applicability. The following projects are subject to this section:
      (1)   Construction of a new residential or non-residential building which
has a building footprint of 800 square feet or more.
      (2)   Major remodeling of an existing residential or non-residential
building which increases the building footprint by 800 square feet or more.
      (3)   Major alteration of an existing residential or non-residential

   (B)   Construction site debris management required. No demolition or
building permit shall be issued for projects subject to this section unless
provisions have been made for construction site debris management as required
by this section and have been submitted and approved by the Director of
Community and Economic Development. The Director of Community and Economic
Development is authorized to grant waivers from the requirements and standards
of this section if unusual site conditions do not allow full compliance with
this section. A demolition or building permit issued for projects subject to
this section may be suspended or revoked by the Director of Community and
Economic Development when the approved construction site debris management as
required by this section is not implemented or followed. These requirements set
minimum standards for the containment of construction debris and the operation,
safety, neatness and cleanliness of the project site to eliminate or minimize
impacts to the site and to the neighborhood.
   (C)   Construction debris. The property owner or contractor shall maintain
the entire construction site clean and free of debris at all times. All
demolition and construction debris shall be placed in the temporary roll-off
construction dumpster. “Clean” for purposes of this section means, without
limitation, removal and placement into the temporary roll-off construction
dumpster of scrap lumber, concrete remnants, transport and packing materials
and scrap roofing materials from the project site. The project site shall be
free of all loose debris such as cans, metal, plastic and paper.
   (D)   Location. The temporary roll-off construction dumpster shall be
located inside the construction site fence; or when no construction site fence
is required for the project, the temporary roll-off construction dumpster shall
be located on the project site unless unusual site conditions do not allow the
dumpster to be located within the fence or on the project site. The placement
of the temporary roll-off construction dumpster shall not be within ten feet of
an abutting dwelling or property line without the express written consent of
the abutting property owner. If unusual site conditions do not allow the
dumpster to be located within the fence or on the project site, the Director of
Community and Economic Development shall approve the location of the temporary
roll-off construction dumpster. The placement of the temporary roll-off
construction dumpster shall be positioned so that no part extends into the
street or right-of-way unless unusual site conditions do not allow the dumpster
to be so located. The Director of Community and Economic Development may permit
the location of the temporary roll-off construction dumpster on a city street
or right-of-way if deemed necessary and in the best interest of the city. If
the dumpster is required to be positioned so that a part extends into the
street or right-of-way, it shall be positioned so that it does not create an
obstruction to traffic. Any permitted dumpster placed on a city street or
within a right-of-way shall be equipped with suitable reflectors or other
warning devices. The city reserves the right to refuse the placement of the
temporary roll-off dumpster and require a suitable relocation if it is
determined by the Director of Community and Economic Development that the
placement constitutes an obstruction, public nuisance or hazard to the general
public. The temporary roll-off dumpster shall bear identification, including
the name, address and telephone number of the owner of the temporary roll-off
construction dumpster.
   (E)   Disposal of construction debris. The temporary roll-off construction
dumpster shall be emptied in a timely fashion so there is no overflow of debris
or litter. The contents placed in a dumpster shall not be allowed at any time
to overflow or fill to a capacity that a current of air may cause debris to
exit the dumpster. No contents shall be placed adjacent to or outside of the
dumpster at any time. No garbage or kitchen waste shall be deposited in any
temporary roll-off construction dumpster. Hazardous materials may not be placed
in the temporary roll-off construction dumpster.
   (F)   Damage. Any property damage incurred as a result of the use of any
dumpster including, but not limited to, damage to the pavement, sidewalks,
curbs or utilities of the city shall be the responsibility of and shall be
repaired or otherwise remedied to the satisfaction of the city by the property
owner or contractor.
   (G)   Duration. The on-site placement and use of a temporary roll-off
construction dumpster for the purposes of a construction or demolition project
is limited to 180 days at any business or residential lot in the city.
Extension may be granted at the discretion of the Director of Community and
Economic Development in cases of inclement weather and other applicable
circumstances. The dumpster shall be removed from the project site prior to a
certificate of occupancy being issued.
   (H)   Removal. Both the property owner and the contractor constructing the
project shall be fully liable and responsible for compliance with the
requirements and regulations pertaining to temporary roll-off construction
dumpsters. The city reserves the right to remove a temporary roll-off
construction dumpster which violates this section if it is determined that the
placement constitutes an obstruction or public nuisance or hazard at its
current placement location or if the time duration has passed and property
owner or contractor has been provided 30 days’ written notice to remove the
dumpster. The property owner and/or the contractor shall be liable to the city
for any costs incurred in such removal and subsequent storage of the dumpster,
together with all charges to dispose of debris contained in the dumpster. In
addition to any other remedies, the city specifically reserves the right to
proceed in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining an
injunction, restraining order or other appropriate remedy to compel compliance
with this section.

§ 52.07 WATER METERS REQUIRED.
   Each building or dwelling unit served by the municipal water system shall be
equipped with a functioning water meter furnished by this municipality:
   (A)   The city will provide water meters as part of the tap on fee. The city
will retain ownership of water meters.
   (B)   The city shall read or cause to be read every water meter in use in
this municipality bi-monthly or at such other times as the City Administrator,
with the concurrence of the City Council, determines is appropriate.
   (C)   Location. A proper connection shall be provided upon each property
supplied with water in an accessible location at least three feet above the
floor and in a manner satisfactory to the Public Services Director or
authorized representative. Every water customer shall have a water meter,
approved by the city, attached to his water supply pipes at this own expense.
On premises where there is no basement or cellar, the meter shall be installed
in the utility room or outside in a meter pit, the location of which shall be
approved by the city. Where it is necessary to set the meter in a pit, such pit
shall be built at the expense of the owners as directed by and to the
satisfaction of the city.
   (D)   New meters. All new water meters shall be provided with remote
registers. The remote registers shall be located on the outside of the building

invoice from the city, the owner or occupant of premises where a meter has been
frozen, injured or damaged shall reimburse the city for the costs for a
replacement meter and its installation and for the removal of the old meter,
based on current costs as established by the Public Services Department.

§ 52.08 CONNECTION PROCEDURES AND CHARGES.
   (A)   Application. Upon application for water service for a property not
already connected to the city's potable water system, the record owner of the
property must sign a water service agreement in a form as provided by the city.
In addition, the beneficial owners, if any, must also sign the water service
agreement, and if the property is a rental property, the property owner must
advise the city of the name of the tenant or occupier of the property.
Regardless of the provisions contained within any lease or rental agreement,
the property owner shall ultimately be responsible for the payment of all fees
and charges incurred pursuant to this chapter or any other ordinance of the
city governing the city's water system. If for any reason whatsoever, any
record owner(s) or beneficial owner(s) fail(s) to sign a water service
agreement as required by this section, then the installation of a water service
line upon the record owner's property or the provision of water service to and
the use of water by the property owner or property owner's tenants, shall
constitute an implied execution of a water service agreement acknowledging that
the property owner accepts and agrees to the provisions of this section and any
subsequent ordinance applicable to the city's water system, including but not
limited to any changes in water rates or connection fees.
   (B)   Connection and expansion tee charges. The owner of each lot or
premises being connected to the municipal water system shall pay any connection
charge to the city required by divisions (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Water connection tap-on fee. The water connection tap-on fee is
intended to reimburse the city for a portion of the construction, maintenance,
and operational costs of the existing water system into which the property
owner seeks to connect. After the property owner makes application to the city
and signs a water service agreement, and either pays the applicable fee, or,
for single-family residential only, executes an installment payment agreement,
the schedule of tap-on fees shall be as follows:
         (a)   Single-family residential charge (within or outside the city
limits): $5,000.
         (b)   Multi-family residential or commercial tap-on fee charge:
 
Size of Tap                    Charge
One and one-half to two inches $5,000
Greater than two inches        As determined by the Office of the City Engineer
                               and City Administrator
 
      (2)   Water expansion/extension fee. The water expansion/extension fee is
intended to reimburse this municipality for the costs of extending water lines
to serve new and additional users and/or increasing the system's capacity to
delivery water. This fee shall be based upon the water user's pro rata share of
all the costs of the extension and/or expansion including, but not limited to,
engineering, supervision, and legal fees, and land acquisition and construction
costs.
         (a)   Whenever the city provides an estimate of the water expansion/
extension fee, it shall be prepared by the offices of the City Engineer and
City Administrator, and the estimate shall be binding on this municipality for
120 days.
         (b)   An applicant who disputes the estimate of the water expansion
and extension fee may appeal to the City Council.
         (c)   The city may accept a donation of construction, expansion, or
extension of its systems in lieu of all or part of the connection charges
established by this section and will execute an agreement with the donor to
enable the donor to recapture some or all of the costs of the donated
construction, expansion or extension of the city's systems.
   (C)   Disconnections and reconnections to the city's potable water system
due to demolition of structures. When a residential or commercial structure
that is connected to the city's potable water system is to be completely
demolished, and all utilities, including but not limited to water, electric,
gas and sanitary, must be physically exposed by way of excavation, the potable
water connection to be installed for the new structure will be considered a new
connection and a water connection tap-on fee will be applied due to the
increase in the water connection size made necessary by the city's fire
suppression requirements as provided in §
150.15(A) through (T) of this code. The water connection tap-on fee amount will
be assessed according to the provisions of §
52.08(B). This requirement for a water connection tap-on fee shall not include
a residential structure which is to be rebuilt after having been destroyed by
fire, wind or some other "Act of God". If the record owner of the property
where a demolition will occur is different than the record of owner who signed
the initial water service agreement pursuant to §
52.08(A), the new record owner of the property shall complete a water service
agreement in a form provided by the city.
   (D)   Other voluntary disconnections and reconnections. A water connection
tap-on fee shall not be applied to a residential or commercial lot for reasons
other than demolition of a structure, such as, service line size upgrades to
increase capacity for a residential fire sprinkler system, or any other
property reconfiguration that would require the disconnection or relocation of
the water service, such as accommodating a driveway relocation.
   (E)   Disconnection from other municipal system. Whenever any property owner
applies for connection to the city's water system and, at the time of such
application has an existing water service connection to another municipal water
system, then the tap-on fee required by this section may be waived by the City
Council if the property owner disconnects from the other municipal water
system, prior to or at the time of connection to the city's water system. All
other applicable fees, charges, or expenses otherwise contained in the code
shall be paid, and the property owner shall comply with all the applicable
ordinances.
   (F)   Compliance with local ordinances. It shall be an implied condition of
each water service agreement and each connection to the city's water system
that the water service customer and the owner of the property being serviced
shall comply with all ordinances, rules or regulations governing the city's
water system as may be now or any time hereafter in effect.

service rates to reflect changes in costs of providing water service.
   (E)   Beginning February 1, 2010, and thereafter, each new owner of real
estate served by the municipal water system and each new registered customer of
the municipal water system shall deposit $75 each with the city to cover non-
payment of water bills. This deposit shall be applied to the final water bill.
Failure of the owner or registered customer to make such deposit within ten
days after occupancy will be considered cause to discontinue the water service
to the real estate as provided in § 52.11.

§ 52.10 BILLING; DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Charges for water service shall be billed bi-monthly and shall be due
and payable within 20 days of billing. All bills for water service shall be
rendered by the city as of the first day of the month succeeding the period for
which the service is billed. If the charges for water service are not paid
within 20 days after the rendition of the bill for such service, there shall be
a penalty imposed of 10% of the amount of the bill. If the charges for water
service are paid, but the check for the payment is returned to the city for
lack of sufficient funds, there shall be a penalty imposed of $25, and proper
payment, including the penalty, must be made to the city within ten days after
the city provides written notice that the initial payment was declined. The
failure to issue water bills as set forth above shall not constitute a waiver,
relinquishment or forfeiture of any right to payment by the city.
   (B)   The owner or owners of any real estate served by the municipal water
system, as referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, is responsible
for the payment of all charges, fees and expenses for providing water service
to the property served, regardless of whether such owner is the water customer
registered with the city. If payments are not made within 60 days after
rendition of the bill therefor, such charges shall be deemed and are hereby
declared to be delinquent. Delinquent charges shall constitute liens upon the
real estate to which the water service was furnished; provided that the city
shall first send to the owner or owners of the real estate, as referenced by
the taxpayer's identification number, a copy of each delinquency notice sent to
the person who is delinquent paying the charges or rates, or other notice
sufficient to inform the owner or owners of record that the charges or rates
have become delinquent, and a notice that unpaid charges or rates may create a
lien on the real estate. Within ten days after such notice to the owner or
owners is sent, the City Treasurer shall file a notice of such lien in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of DuPage County, which notice shall consist of
a sworn statement setting out a description of such real estate sufficient for
the identification thereof, the amount of money due for water service, and the
date when such amount became delinquent. A copy of such notice of the lien
shall be sent to the owner or owners of record of the real estate, as
referenced by the taxpayer's identification number, and the city shall have the
power to foreclose such lien in the same manner and with the same effect as in
the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate.
   (C)   The city shall also have the power, from time to time, to sue the
occupant or user of the real estate served by the municipal water system in a
civil action to recover the money due for such water services rendered, plus a
reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court, and if a judgment is
rendered in the city's favor in such action, the lien filed pursuant to
division (B) of this section shall no longer exist, and the judgment rendered
shall operate as a release and waiver of the lien for the amount of the
judgment.

§ 52.11 NON-VOLUNTARY DISCONNECTION FROM CITY WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   If the required deposit for water service is not paid by any new owner
or customer within 30 days after occupancy of any real estate served by the
municipal water system, or if charges for water service are not paid within 60
days after the due date, the city will begin procedures to disconnect the water
service from the municipal water system. Prior to any such disconnection,
written notice shall be sent to the registered customer and the owner or owners
of record, as referenced by the tax identification number, by regular mail,
identifying the location of the service to be disconnected, stating the date on
which disconnection will occur, identifying the person at the city who may be
contacted if the customer or owner wishes to dispute the claimed charges, and
stating the date by which the person must be contacted if the customer or owner
wishes to have an opportunity to be heard concerning the dispute. Failure to
receive or claim the written notice will not nullify the notice or the city’s
disconnection procedures.
   (B)   Failure to contact the person at the city identified in the notice
provided for in division (A) of this section, or to resolve the payment of the
delinquent charges on or before the disconnection date set forth in such
notice, will result in immediate disconnection of water service. Additional
billings for water service will not nullify the notice or disconnection
procedures.
   (C)   Disconnected water service shall not be reinstated until all past due
charges, including penalties thereon, are paid in full, together with a charge
of $50 for reinstating service during scheduled working hours or $75 for
reinstating service after normal working hours. The owner or registered
customer shall also each be required to deposit $25 in addition to the water
service deposit provided for pursuant to §
52.09(E). All payments related to reinstatement of water service must be in the
form of cash, money order, cashiers check, or other electronic means if made
available to the city.

§ 53.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the proper
establishment of new trees, the protection and maintenance of existing trees
and the timely removal of hazardous, infectious or diseased trees on property
lying between property lines on either side of any streets, highways, and
public rights-of-way; and on or in any easements, public parks or any other
areas owned or under the jurisdiction of the city. In this regard, the City
Council finds and declares that:
      (1)   Trees enhance and preserve the air quality of the city through the
filtering effect of trees on air pollutants;
      (2)   Trees reduce noise within the city through the baffle and barrier
effect of trees on the spread of noise;
      (3)   Trees reduce topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of
tree roots;
      (4)   Trees reduce energy consumption through the wind break and shade
effects of trees;
      (5)   Trees provide nesting areas for birds and other wildlife, which
birds and other wildlife, in turn, assist in the control of insects;
      (6)   Trees reduce storm water runoff and the costs associated therewith;
      (7)   Trees replenish ground water supplies; and
      (8)   Trees protect and increase property values.
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of the City Council that the terms of this
chapter shall be construed so as to promote:
      (1)   The planting, maintenance, restoration and survival of desirable
trees, shrubs and other plants within the city; and
      (2)   The protection of community residents from personal injury and
property damage, and the protection of the city from property damage, caused or
threatened by the improper planting, maintenance, or removal of, or the failure
to remove hazardous, infectious or diseased trees, shrubs, or other plants
located within the city.

§ 78.03 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES.
   (A)   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a motor
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the
police officer shall cause the motor vehicle to be removed or towed to a
facility authorized by the city. When the motor vehicle is removed or towed,
the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself or herself as
the owner of record of the motor vehicle, or any person who is found to be in
control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged violation(s), if there
is such a person, that the motor vehicle has been seized and that the owner of
record has a right to request a preliminary hearing as provided in this
chapter. The motor vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the
hearings provided for in this chapter, unless the owner of record of the motor
vehicle posts a cash bond with the city as set forth in §
78.04 of this chapter.
   (B)   A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a motor
vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this chapter shall
first ascertain whether the seizure and impoundment is necessary and reasonable
under the circumstances. Before a vehicle is towed, if in the judgment of the
police officer then present, a person authorized by the owner or operator of
the vehicle is present and able to provide for the lawful immediate removal of
the vehicle, the vehicle will be released to that person for prompt removal,
and if the prompt removal occurs, no administrative penalty will be imposed
upon that vehicle.

bond and the towing and storage charges shall be payable by debit card, credit
card or cash. If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to §
78.06(B) of this chapter, the bond shall be applied to the fee, provided that
if a violation of this chapter is not proven, the bond shall be returned to the
person posting the bond. All bonds posted pursuant to this section shall be
held by the city until a hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is
judicial review pursuant to §
78.10, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.

§ 78.05 PRELIMINARY HEARING.
   Where the owner of record of a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of
this chapter makes a request for a preliminary hearing, in writing, and filed
with the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police’s designee within 12 hours
after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the Chief of Police or the Chief of
Police’s designee must conduct a preliminary hearing within 24 hours after the
request for a preliminary hearing is received by the city; provided that if the
date for the preliminary hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday,
the preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day following the
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, the following
shall apply.
   (A)   All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the preliminary hearing.
   (B)   The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary
hearing, and hearsay testimony shall be allowed and admissible.
   (C)   If, after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the Chief of
Police or a duly authorized designee determines that there is probable cause to
believe that the motor vehicle has been operated in a manner constituting a
public nuisance as provided in §
78.02 of this chapter, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Police’s designee
shall order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle, unless the owner of
record of the motor vehicle posts a cash bond with the city in the amount of
$500, and pays the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company,
as set forth in §
78.04 of this chapter.
   (D)   If the Chief of Police or a duly authorized designee determines that
there is not probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle has been operated
in a manner constituting a public nuisance as provided in §
78.02 of this chapter, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of
record of the motor vehicle without any fees or other costs, but the owner of
record shall nevertheless be responsible to pay any towing or storage charges
to the applicable towing company.
(Ord. 09-23, passed 11-10-09)
§ 78.06 PLEA HEARING/EVIDENTIARY HEARING.
   (A)   Notice of hearing. Within ten days after a motor vehicle is impounded
pursuant to this chapter, the city shall notify the owner of record of the
date, time and location of a plea hearing that shall be conducted, pursuant to
this section. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested, and First Class U.S. Mail to the owner of record, as shown on the
records of the Illinois Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail or First
Class U.S. Mail need not be given when the owner of record of the motor vehicle
has been personally served with written notice of the time, date and location
of the plea hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer
designated by the City Administrator. The owner of record shall appear at a
plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is
entered, or if the owner of record fails to appear, the cause shall be disposed
of at that time, with an order or default order in favor of the city, which
order or default order shall require payment to the city of the $500
administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company as provided in division (B) of this section, and the continued
impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record makes such payments.
If the owner of record pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall be
scheduled and held no later than 45 days after the motor vehicle was impounded,
unless continued by the hearing officer. All interested persons shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing. At any time
prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request
of either the city or the owner of record, direct witnesses to appear and give
testimony at the evidentiary hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not
apply at the evidentiary hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be allowed and
admissible.
   (B)   If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer determines, by
a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in connection
with a violation set forth in §
78.02 of this chapter, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the
owner of record of the motor vehicle civilly liable to the city for an
administrative fee in the amount of $500, and require the motor vehicle to
continue to be impounded until the owner of record pays such administrative fee
to the city and pays the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company. The $500 administrative fee shall be a debt due to the city. If a bond
has been posted pursuant to §
78.04 or §
78.05(C) above, the bond shall be applied to the administrative fee. If the
owner of record fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer
shall enter a default order in favor of the city, which order shall require the
payment to the city of the $500 administrative fee and towing and storage costs
to the applicable towing company and the continued impoundment of the motor
vehicle until the owner of record makes such payments. If the hearing officer
finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the
immediate return of the owner of record's motor vehicle without any fee or, if
a bond had previously been posted, if the bond was posted in cash, the cash
bond shall be returned or if the bond was posted by debit or credit card, a
credit issued; but the owner of record shall nevertheless be responsible for
any towing or storage charges to the applicable towing company.
   (C)   At the evidentiary hearing, the citation issued for the violation
shall be prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in
the citation; and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to
prove that the violation was not committed.

   (A)   If the administrative fee and applicable towing and storage charges
are not paid within 30 days after an owner of record defaults by failing to
appear at the hearings as provided for in §
78.06 of this chapter, or admits guilt at the plea hearing, the motor vehicle
shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by
law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to ILCS Ch. 625,
Act 5, §§ 1-100 et seq., as amended. In all other cases, if the administrative
fee and applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company

administrative review of the hearing officer’s determination may be sought
pursuant to §
78.10 of this chapter, or within 30 days after an action seeking administrative
review has been resolved in favor of the city, whichever is applicable, the
motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provide by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to ILCS
Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 1-100 et seq., as amended.

lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a
motor vehicle impounded under this chapter until the required administrative
fee has been paid to the city and the towing and storage costs have been paid
to the applicable towing company; however, when a person with a lien of record
against an impounded motor vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings,
possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she
agrees in writing to refund to the city the amount of the net proceeds of any
foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record,
not to exceed the total of the required administrative fees and the applicable
towing and storage costs.

CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY
§ 95.30 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to establish policies and
procedures for constructing facilities on and within rights-of-way under the
city's jurisdiction, which will provide a public benefit consistent with the
preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city
rights-of-way and the city as a whole.
   (B)   Intent. In enacting this subchapter, the city intends to exercise its
authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the
public rights-of-way and property by utilities, by establishing uniform

limitation:
      (1)   Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public rights-of-way and places;
      (2)   Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      (3)   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or on
public property;
      (4)   Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees,
from the installation of utility facilities;
      (5)   Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;

installed;
      (7)   Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that
characterize the city's residential neighborhoods;
      (8)   Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the
rights-of-way; and

facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-
of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established

repaired and operated as presently constructed and located, except as may be
otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (D)   Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its
discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a
franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their
facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across or within the city's
rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an
agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an
agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this
subchapter.
   (E)   Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements.
      (1)   Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event
that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise,

agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof, unless otherwise provided in such
franchise, license or similar agreement.
      (2)   Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between the provisions of this subchapter and the provisions of
any franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any

similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof, unless otherwise provided in such
franchise, license or similar agreement.
   (F)   Conflicts with other chapters. This subchapter supersedes all chapters
or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the
extent of such conflict.
   (G)   Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable
federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this
subchapter, compliance with the requirements hereof shall be required to the
maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
   (H)   Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering
judgment when administering this subchapter, and may vary the standards,
conditions, and requirements expressed herein when the city so determines.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to regulate
its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

§ 95.35 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Commencement of work. Work for which a permit has been issued shall
commence within 30 days after issuance of the permit. If not so commenced, the
permit shall be automatically terminated unless the permittee applies to the
City Engineer or Public Services Director, in writing, for an extension of time
within which to commence work. If such an extension is granted, the original
permit shall remain in force for the period of the extension. Any permit that
terminates for lack of work within the 30 days or any extension thereof may be
renewed only upon the payment of an additional permit fee of $50, except that
if any such extension requires different plans, then the extension fee shall be
equal to the initial fee.
   (B)   Expiration of permits. Every permit shall expire at the end of the
time stated in the permit, unless the permittee applies to the Engineer or
Public Services Director, in writing, for an extension of time within which to
complete work, setting forth the reasons for the requested extension. If, in
the opinion of the Engineer or Public Services Director, such an extension is
necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the permittee may be granted
additional time for the completion of the work.
   (C)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with this subchapter on city rights-of-way, and does
not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon
the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way.
   (D)   Duration. No permit issued under this subchapter shall be valid for a
period longer than 180 days after the date of issuance of a permit, unless such
time is extended in the discretion of the Engineer or Public Services Director.
All construction work authorized by a permit within the city's rights-of-way,
including restoration, must be completed within such time.
   (E)   Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this subchapter prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the city with
such city representatives in attendance as the city deems necessary. The
meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and
reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur,
including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities
in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other
utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access
and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (F)   Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the
city does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of
the city and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
   (G)   Compliance with permit. All construction permits and activities shall
be in accordance with the permit and approved final plans and specifications
for the facilities. The City Engineer or Public Services Director and his or
her representatives shall be provided access to the work and such further
information as may be required to ensure compliance with such requirements.
   (H)   Display of permit and plans. The permittee shall maintain a copy of
the construction permit and approved plans at the construction site, which
shall be displayed and made available for inspection by the Engineer or Public
Services Director or his or her representative at all times when construction
work is occurring.
   (I)   Location of facilities. If the construction permit specified the
location of facilities by depth, line, grade, proximity to other facilities or
other standard, the permittee shall cause the location of such facilities to be
verified by a registered Illinois land surveyor. The permittee shall relocate
any facilities that are not located in compliance with permit requirements.
(Ord. 07-18, passed 10-23-07; Am. Ord. 08-13, passed 8-12-08)
§ 95.36 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or as-built plans to the city within 60 days
after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or as-built
plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities
deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the
permit also deviates from the requirements of this subchapter, it shall be
treated as a request for variance in accordance with §
95.49. If the city denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall
either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that
it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

   (A)   General requirements. In addition to location requirements applicable
to specific types of utility facilities, all utility facilities, regardless of
type, shall be subject to the general location requirements of this division
(A).
      (1)   No interference with city facilities. No utility facilities shall
be placed in any location if the city determines that the proposed location
will require the relocation or displacement of any of the city's utility
facilities or will otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any
of the city's utility facilities.
      (2)   Minimum interference and impact. The proposed location shall cause
only the minimum possible interference with the use of the right-of-way and
shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and interference with the
rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin the right-of-
way.
      (3)   No interference with travel. No utility facility shall be placed in
any location that interferes with the usual travel on such right-of-way.
      (4)   No limitations on visibility. No utility facility shall be placed
in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of the right-of-way.
      (5)   Size of utility facilities. The proposed installation shall use the
smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment enclosures, power pedestals, and/or
cabinets then in use by the facility owner, regardless of location, for the
particular application.
   (B)   Parallel facilities located within highways.
      (1)   Overhead parallel facilities. An overhead parallel facility maybe
located within the right-of-way lines of a highway only if:
         (a)   Lines are located as near as practicable to the right-of-way
line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as reasonable pole
alignment will permit;
         (b)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as remote as practicable
from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6m) behind the face of the
curb, where available;
         (c)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as remote from pavement
edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet (1.2m) outside the outer
shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the clear zone;
         (d)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a highway; and
         (e)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located within one foot

highway only if other locations are impracticable or inconsistent with sound
engineering judgment (e.g., a new cable may be installed in existing conduit
without disrupting the pavement); and
         (c)   In the case of an underground power or communications line, the
facility shall be located as near to the right-of-way line as practicable and
not more than five feet (1.5m) from the right-of-way line, and any above-ground
appurtenance shall be located one foot (0.3m) inside the right-of-way line, or
as near as practicable.
   (C)   Facilities crossing highways.
      (1)   No future disruption. The construction and design of crossing
facilities installed between the ditch lines, curb lines, or concrete ribbon
lines of highways may require the incorporation of materials and protections
(such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future repairs
to the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing facilities.
      (2)   Culverts or drainage facilities. Crossing facilities shall not be
located in culverts or drainage facilities.
      (3)   Ninety degree crossing required. Crossing facilities shall cross at
or as near to a 90 degree angle to the centerline as practicable.
      (4)   Overhead power or communication facility. An overhead power or

armless, single-pole construction, with vertical configuration of conductors
and cable. Existing utility poles and light standards shall be used wherever
practicable; the installation of additional utility poles is strongly
discouraged.
      (4)   The proposed installation shall, to the degree feasible, utilize
surplus space on an existing pole.
   (G)   Facility attachments to bridges or roadway structures.
      (1)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to bridges or roadway
structures only where the permittee has demonstrated that all other means of
accommodating the facility are not practicable. Other means shall include, but
are not limited to, underground, underwater, independent poles, cable supports
and tower supports, all of which are completely separated from the bridge or
roadway structure. Facilities transmitting commodities that are volatile,
flammable, corrosive, or energized, especially those under significant pressure
or potential, present high degrees of risk and such installations are not
permitted.
      (2)   A permittee shall include in its request to accommodate a facility
installation on a bridge or roadway structure, supporting data demonstrating
the impracticability of alternate routing. Approval or disapproval of an
application for facility attachment to a bridge or roadway structure will be
based upon the following considerations:
         (a)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the commodity to be
transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to persons and property in
the event of damage to or failure of the facility;
         (b)   The type, length, value, and relative importance of the highway
structure in the transportation system;
         (c)   The alternative routings available to the permittee and their

locations in order to preserve visual quality.
      (2)   A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not
require extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to
the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents and property owners, and if it
does not impair the aesthetic quality of the lands being traversed.
(Ord. 07-18, passed 10-23-07)
§ 95.44 CONSTRUCTION MEANS AND METHODS.
   (A)   Standards and requirements for particular types of construction
methods.
      (1)   Boring or jacking.
         (a)   Pits and shoring. Boring or jacking under rights-of-way shall be
accomplished from pits located at a minimum distance specified by the Public
Services Director from the edge of the pavement. The permittee shall verify the
locations of all city utilities by actual digging and exposing at each and
every crossing and at intervals of 200 feet where lines run parallel with the
proposed installation. Pits for boring or jacking shall be excavated no more
than 48 hours in advance of boring or jacking operations and backfilled within
48 hours after boring or jacking operations are completed. While pits are open,
they shall be clearly marked and protected by barricades. Shoring shall be
designed, erected, supported, braced, and maintained so that it will safely
support all vertical and lateral loads that may be imposed upon it during the
boring or jacking operation.
         (b)   Wet boring or jetting. Wet boring or jetting shall not be
permitted under the roadway.
         (c)   Borings with diameters greater than six inches. Borings over six
inches (0.15m) in diameter shall be accomplished with an auger and following
pipe, and the diameter of the auger shall not exceed the outside diameter of
the following pipe by more than one inch (25mm).
         (d)   Borings with diameters six inches or less. Borings of six inches
or less in diameter maybe accomplished by either jacking, guiding with auger,
or auger and following pipe method.
         (e)   Tree preservation. Any facility located within the drip line of
any tree designated by the city to be preserved or protected shall be bored
under or around the root system.
      (2)   Trenching. Trenching for facility installation, repair, or
maintenance on rights-of-way shall be done in accordance with the applicable
portions of § 603 of IDOT's Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction.
         (a)   Length. The length of open trench shall be kept to the
practicable minimum consistent with requirements for pipe-line testing. Only
one-half of any intersection may have an open trench at any time unless special
permission is obtained from the Public Services Director.
         (b)   Open trench and excavated material. Open trench and windrowed
excavated material shall be protected as required by
Chapter 6 of the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Where
practicable, the excavated material shall be deposited between the roadway and
the trench as added protection. Excavated material shall not be allowed to
remain on the paved portion of the roadway. Where right-of-way width does not
allow for windrowing excavated material off the paved portion of the roadway,
excavated material shall be hauled to an off-road location. If the right-of-way
width is insufficient to hold the excavated material without using part of an
adjacent sidewalk, bike path or other type of pedestrian pathway, the permittee
shall keep a passageway at least one-half the sidewalk width open. In order to
expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, the Public
Services Director may require that the permittee provide toe-boards or lines;
and if the excavated area is muddy and causes inconvenience to pedestrians,
temporary wooden plank walls shall be installed by the permittee as directed by
the Public Services Director.
         (c)   Drip line of trees. The permittee shall not trench within the
drip line of any tree designated by the city to be preserved.
      (3)   Backfilling.
         (a)   Any pit, trench, or excavation created during the installation
of facilities shall be backfilled for its full width, depth, and length, using
methods and materials in accordance with IDOT's Standard Specifications for
Road and Bridge Construction. When excavated material is hauled away or is
unsuitable for backfill, suitable granular backfill shall be used.
         (b)   No backfilling shall be permitted where city utilities are
exposed until inspected by the city.
         (c)   Minimum cover for all backfilling of water lines shall be five
feet in depth.
         (d)   For a period of three years from the date construction of a
facility is completed, the permittee shall be responsible to remove and restore
any backfilled area that has settled due to construction of the facility. If so
ordered by the Public Services Director, the permittee, at its expense, shall
remove any pavement and backfill material to the top of the installed facility,
place and properly compact new backfill material, and restore new pavement,
sidewalk, curbs, and driveways to the proper grades, as determined by the
Public Services Director.
      (4)   Pavement cuts. Pavement cuts for facility installation or repair
shall be permitted on a highway only if that portion of the highway is closed
to traffic. If a variance to the limitation set forth in this division is
permitted under §
95.49, the following requirements shall apply:
         (a)   Any excavation under pavements shall be backfilled and compacted
as soon as practicable with granular material of CA-6 to CA-10 gradation, as
designated by the Public Services Director.
         (b)   Restoration of pavement, in kind, shall be accomplished as soon
as practicable, and temporary repair with bituminous mixture shall be provided
immediately. Any subsequent failure of either the temporary repair or the
restoration shall be rebuilt upon notification by the city.
         (c)   All saw cuts shall be full depth.
         (d)   For all rights-of-way which have been reconstructed with a
concrete surface/base in the last seven years, or resurfaced in the last three
years, permits shall not be issued unless such work is determined to be an
emergency repair or other work considered necessary and unforeseen before the
time of the reconstruction or unless a pavement cut is necessary for a
J.U.L.I.E. locate.
      (5)   Encasement.
         (a)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand the load of the
highway and any other superimposed loads. The casing shall be continuous either
by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed installation approved by the
city.
         (b)   The venting, if any, of any encasement shall extend to no more
than one foot (0.3m) inside the right-of-way line. No above-ground vent pipes
shall be located in the area established as clear zone for that particular
section of the highway.
         (c)   In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall
be furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or jointed pipe approved
by the city is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if pipe is
installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is continuous or
mechanical joints are of a type approved by the city. Bell and spigot type pipe
shall be encased regardless of installation method.
         (d)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or less, encasement may
be eliminated.
         (e)   In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines
with installations of more than 60 psig, encasement maybe eliminated only if:
            1.   Extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair; and
            2.   Cathodic protection of the pipe is provided;
         (f)   If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products
pipeline, the facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does
not disrupt the right-of-way.
      (6)   Minimum cover of underground facilities. Cover shall be provided

which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         (a)   Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within
300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure
and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the
city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within
300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall
control the height limitation for such facility; or
         (b)   Forty-five (45) feet above ground level.
   (I)   Height exceptions. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or
replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small
wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a
variation in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in §
156.23.
   (J)   Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
   (K)   Ground-mounted equipment apacing. The wireless provider shall comply
with §
95.43 concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-
of-way. If an applicant proposes a facility to be located in the public right-
of-way which would not comply the requirements of §
95.43, the applicant shall apply for a variation in conformance with
procedures, terms and conditions set forth in §
156.23.
   (L)   Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with §
95.43 Illinois, concerning the location of facilities in the right-of-way and

   (M)   Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless
the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is
caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of
commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless
provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the
permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to
complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit.
Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in
writing to the applicant.
   (N)   Cooperation with other small wireless service providers. As a
condition of any permit for installation of a new pole, small wireless support
structure, or other above-ground facility granted pursuant to this subchapter,
permittees shall be required to cooperate with other small wireless providers
in collocating additional small wireless facilities on poles and small wireless
support structures owned by the permittee, provided that such proposed
additional small wireless provider has been issued permits for that location by
the city as described herein. All permittees shall exercise good faith in
collocating with other small wireless providers regarding sharing of the
permitted site, provided that such shared use does not give rise to a
substantial technical level of impairment of the ability to provide the
permitted use (i.e., significant interference in broadcast or reception
capabilities as opposed to a competitive conflict or financial burden). Such
good faith shall include sharing technical information to evaluate the
feasibility of sharing utility poles or small wireless infrastructure. In the
event that a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith
in accommodating other users, the city may require a third-party technical
study at the expense of the applicant, the permittee, or both.

§ 95.110 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the city harmless against any
and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the city
improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this subchapter and the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act. A wireless provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold
harmless against any liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the
sole negligence of the city or its employees or agents. A wireless provider
shall further waive any claims that it may have against the city with respect
to consequential, incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the
theory of liability.
(Ord. 18-27, passed 6-26-18)

(Ord. 18-27, passed 6-26-18)
§ 95.112 STEALTH, CONCEALMENT AND AESTHETIC STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purposes of this section are to:
      (1)   Provide a variety of locations and options for wireless providers
while minimizing the negative visual impacts associated with small wireless
facilities;
      (2)   Encourage creative approaches in locating and designing small
wireless facilities that blend in with the surroundings of such facilities;
      (3)   Provide standards that comply with the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (the "Telecommunications Act") and the Small Wireless Facilities
Deployment Act (ILCS Ch. 50, Act 835, §§ 1 et seq.); the provisions of this
section are not intended and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or have the
effect of prohibiting personal wireless services as defined in the
Telecommunications Act; and
      (4)   Administer the provisions of this subchapter in such a manner as
not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent
personal wireless services, as defined in the Telecommunications Act.
   (B)   Site location and development of small wireless facilities shall
preserve the existing character of the surrounding buildings and landscape to
the extent consistent with the function of the proposed small wireless
facilities. All small wireless support infrastructure and poles shall be
integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site to the extent practical. Existing on-site
vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance to the existing
topography shall be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less
adverse visual impact to the surrounding area. The following provisions
establish design and concealment standards for small wireless facilities.
      (1)   Building attachment. Small wireless facilities may be mounted to a
building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme.
To the extent possible all small wireless facilities shall be concealed within
a structure that is architecturally compatible with the existing rooftop.
Rooftop additions shall be concealed on all sides.
      (2)   Small wireless facilities attached to the side or roof of buildings
shall employ a symmetrical, balanced design for all facade mounted antennas.
Subsequent deployments will be required to ensure consistent design,
architectural treatment, and symmetry when placing antennas on the structure's
exterior with any existing small wireless facilities on the same side of the
structure.
      (3)   The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical
reveals is prohibited unless demonstrated to be unavoidable.
      (4)   New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or
other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the
architecture of the existing building.
      (5)   Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting
brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building.
      (6)      Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of
antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance,
and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed conduit, cabling and
wiring is prohibited.
      (7)   Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match
the adjacent building surfaces.
      (8)   All installations of small wireless facilities shall have
permission from the pole/structure owner to install facilities on such
structure.
   (C)   Signs.
      (1)   Small wireless facilities replicating a sign shall be subject to
the requirements of §
156.43. A sign permit is required unless the small wireless facilities are
placed entirely within an existing sign.
      (2)   All antennas shall be completely screened by the facade of the
sign.
      (3)   All cables and conduit to and from the sign shall be routed from
within the building wall or structure upon which the sign is mounted. Cable
coverings may be allowed on the exterior of the building wall in limited
circumstances in situations where they are minimally visible and concealed to
match the adjacent building surfaces.
   (D)   Existing or replacement utility poles. An existing utility pole may be
replaced or altered to accommodate small wireless facilities and related
equipment subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Replacement utility poles shall conform to any design standard for
the surrounding zoning district, subdivision, or planned unit development,
including, but not limited to, Historic Districts as defined herein and planned
unit developments as defined in Chapter 156 of this code. The replacement pole
shall look substantially the same as existing poles in the surrounding zoning
district, subdivision, or planned unit development.
      (2)   When no design standard is identified for a particular zoning
district, subdivision, or planned unit development, replacement poles shall
match the height, width, color, and material of the original or adjacent poles.
The maximum height of any new or replacement pole shall not exceed limits
specified in §
95.103(H), subject to any variation requested pursuant to §
95.103(I). The city may, likewise, approve minor variations of up to 50% of the
pole width or 30 inches, whichever is greater, when housing equipment within
the pole base.
      (3)   Replacement poles shall be located as close as possible to the
existing pole to be replaced, and the replaced pole shall be removed.
      (4)   Wherever compatible with the pole design and technologically
feasible, all equipment and cabling shall be internal to the replacement street
lighting or traffic signal standard or otherwise camouflaged to appear to be an
integrated part of a utility pole. If equipment or cabling is not proposed to
be placed internal to the replacement pole, a concealment element plan shall be
submitted in accordance with the provisions of §
95.112(B) of this subchapter.
      (5)   No illumination. Small wireless facilities shall not be
illuminated.
      (6)   Generators and backup battery. Generators are not permitted for
small wireless facilities. All proposed battery backups must be requested
through the submittal of a concealment element plan in accordance with the
provisions of §
95.112(B) of this subchapter.
      (7)   Cabinet location and dimensions. The equipment cabinet for small
wireless facilities shall be the smallest amount of cabinet enclosure necessary
to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be located outside of the
primary equipment cabinet.
      (8)   Flush-mounting and pole-top antennas. In situations when interior
concealment is demonstrated not to be possible, the small wireless facility
shall, to the full extent permitted under the state electrical code and the
utilities' requirements, be flush-mounted on the subject pole, which means
mounting directly to the pole with little to no gap other than that which may
be required for the screws/bolts, or located at the top of the pole. Canisters
attached to the top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole unless
technically required and then shall not be more than 50% greater than the
diameter of the pole.
      (9)   Antenna design. Where an enclosure is proposed to house an antenna,
the antenna shall be located in an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet in
volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed elements, the antenna and all
of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than six cubic
feet. No more than four antennas are permitted on a single pole and with a
total volume not to exceed 24 cubic feet.
      (10)   Material and color. If interior concealment described in §
95.112(B) is not possible, the small wireless facility shall to the maximum
extent feasible match the color of the pole and shall be non-reflective.
   (E)   New poles. In areas of the city in which above-ground facilities are
allowed in the public right-of-way pursuant to §
95.43 the installation of a new pole for the purpose of locating small wireless
facilities is permitted only when the applicant establishes that:
      (1)   The small wireless facility cannot be located on a site outside of
the public right-of-way such as a public park, public property, or in or on a
building whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure; and
      (2)   The small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing pole
within the public right-of-way; and
      (3)   The applicant shall establish the foregoing requirements by
submission of competent documentary evidence that:
         (a)   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering plans;
         (b)   Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless
support structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's
engineering requirements;
         (c)   Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless
support structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the
applicant's proposed small wireless facility;
         (d)   The applicant's proposed small wireless facility would cause
electromagnetic interference with the existing utility poles, towers, base
stations, or small wireless facilities, or the existing utility poles, towers,
base stations, or small wireless facilities would cause interference with the
applicant's proposed small wireless facility;
         (e)   The fees, costs and contractual provisions required by the
owners of the existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless
support structures to share existing space, or to adapt existing structures for
sharing space are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are
presumed to be unreasonable;
         (f)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors
which render existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless
support structures unsuitable; and
         (g)   Applicants shall provide evidence that reasonable efforts to
develop an alternative location on an existing utility pole, tower or small
wireless support structure have been made.
      (4)   Any proposed new utility pole or small wireless support structure
proposed by an applicant shall comply with a preferred concealment technique as
described in §
95.112(B) or an approved concealment element plan as provided in §
95.112(I).
   (F)   Ground-mounted equipment standards; ADA compliance required. To allow
full use of the public right-of-way by pedestrians, bicycles and other users,
all ground-mounted equipment other than poles or wireless support structures
shall be housed underground in a vault meeting the city's construction
standards. The location of wireless support structures, replacement poles, and/
or any new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
city construction standards, and state and federal regulations in order to
provide a clear and safe passage within the public right-of-way.
   (G)   Maximum noise levels. No small wireless facilities or related
equipment shall be operated to produce noise levels above 40 decibels as
measured from the nearest property line to which the small wireless facility is
located.
   (H)   Advertising prohibited. No lettering, symbols, images, or trademarks
large enough to be legible to pedestrian or vehicular users of the right-of-way
or other persons occupying the space in the immediate area of the small
wireless facility, utility pole, or small wireless support structure shall be
placed on or affixed to any utility pole, small wireless support structure, or
small wireless facility other than as required by Federal Communications
Commission regulations or other applicable law. Small wireless facilities
concealed within signs or billboards shall not be construed to be in violation
of this prohibition.
   (I)   Concealment element plan.
      (1)   Concealment element plan required. Applications for proposed small
wireless facility installations which do not conform to a preferred concealment
technique as identified in §
95.112(B) shall submit a concealment element plan. The plan shall include the
design of the screening, fencing, or other concealment technology for a base
station, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment
or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility.
      (2)   Purpose of concealment element plan, generally. Concealment element
plans should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of proposed small
wireless facilities using methods including, but not limited to, integrating
the installation with architectural features or building design components,
utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and
texture, or the appearance thereof, as the surface or background against which
the small wireless facility will be seen or on which it will be installed.
Other concealment element approaches may include, but not be limited to, use of
street furniture concealment products such as trash cans, benches, information
kiosks, or other types of enclosures reasonably compatible to conceal ground
level equipment. Additionally, the use of a concealment support or device, such
as a clock tower, steeple, flagpole, tree, wayfinding sign, decorative pole
with banner, art work, street sign, or other applicable concealment structure
may be approved.
      (3)   Review of concealment element plan. Where a small wireless facility
is proposed that does not comply with a preferred concealment technique as
specified in §
95.112(B), a concealment element plan shall be subject to city review and
approval in conformance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in
§
156.23.
(Ord. 18-27, passed 6-26-18)
§ 95.999 PENALTY.
   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with
any of the provisions of §§
95.30 through
95.50 of this chapter shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty
provisions of this code. There may be times when the city will incur delay or
other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or
cannot perform its duties under its permit and §§
95.30 through
95.50. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of
undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the
city's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying,
relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No
other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit
related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility
that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

§ 111.014 PRIVILEGE GRANTED BY LICENSE; NATURE AS TO PROPERTY; TRANSFERABILITY.
   A license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed one
year after issuance, unless sooner revoked as in this subchapter provided, and
shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment,
garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or transferable,
voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated.
Such license shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution,
but it shall cease upon the death of the licensee; provided, that executors or
administrators of the estate of any deceased licenses, and the trustee of any
insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in part of alcoholic
liquor, may continue the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic
liquor under the order of the appropriate court, and may exercise the
privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of
such decedent, or after such insolvency or bankruptcy, until the expiration of
such license, but not longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy or
insolvency. A refund shall be made for any portion of the license fees paid for
any period in which the licensee shall not have operated under such license as
a result of the provisions of this section.
(Ord. 02-44, passed 11-26-02)
§ 111.015 CHANGE IN PERSONNEL.
   (A)   The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall be
deemed to constitute a change in ownership of licensed businesses for which a
new license shall be required:
      (1)   With respect to any licensee that is a corporation, the replacement
or addition of any shareholder owning directly or indirectly (including
ownership by members of the same household) 20% or more of the outstanding
share of any class of the capital stock of said corporation; provided that any
sale or exchange of stock which results in a change in controlling ownership
under the by-laws of the corporation shall be deemed to be a change of
ownership hereunder regardless of the percentage of actual sale or exchange;
      (2)   With respect to any licensee that is a general partnership, the
replacement or addition of any general partner;
      (3)   With respect to any licensee that is a limited partnership, the
replacement or addition of any general partner or of any limited partner
holding directly or indirectly (including ownership by members of the same
household) 20% or more interest in the earnings of said limited partnership;
      (4)   The operation of a licensed business by an unlicensed individual or
corporation under a management agreement which permits such unlicensed
individual or corporation to control and direct the operation of the business,
to retain all or a majority or the profits derived from such business, and to
utilize the privileges of the liquor license issued to another for such
business for any period in excess of 90 days. A management agreement shall not
be deemed to include a contract for employment between a licensee and an
individual manager or managers, who operate the licensed business on behalf of
or at the direction of the licensee.
   (B)   At least 90 days prior to any of the events described in paragraph (A)
hereof as constituting a change of ownership, the licensee shall apply for a
new license pursuant to the requirements of §
111.005 of this subchapter, and shall pay the required application fee in
conjunction therewith. The Commissioner shall act promptly thereon; however,
the licensee shall not conduct its business following any change of ownership
as defined herein until a new license has been issued.
   (C)   The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall
constitute a change in ownership of licensed businesses for which a new license
shall be required, but shall not be subject to the application requirements
established in §
111.005 of this subchapter. Within five business days following any change
described below, the licensee shall notify the Commissioner in writing
describing the event in detail:
      (1)   With respect to any licensee that is a corporation, the replacement
or addition of any officer or director of said corporation or any shareholder
owning directly or indirectly (including ownership by members of the same
household) more than 5% but less than 20% of the outstanding shares of any
class of the capital stock of said corporation;
      (2)   With respect to any licensee that is a limited partnership, the
replacement or addition of any limited partner holding directly or indirectly
(including ownership by members of the same household) more than a 5% but less
than a 20% interest in the earnings of said limited partnership.
   Failure to give the notice required shall constitute a violation of this
subchapter subjecting the licensee to revocation or suspension of the license.
No additional license fee shall be payable for a new license required by virtue
of changes described in this paragraph, and so long as an application therefor
is pending and not yet acted upon by the Commissioner, the applicant may
continue to conduct its business and operations under the license in effect
immediately prior to such changes.
   (D)   Within ten days of any change of liquor manager conducting business
for the licensee, the licensee shall report such change to the Commissioner, in
writing, and shall provide information concerning such liquor manager as
required in §
111.005(A)(9) of this subchapter. A fee of $150 shall be paid in conjunction
with any such change of manager.
   (E)   All new personnel shall meet all the standards of this subchapter and
must otherwise qualify to hold a liquor license. All such changes in personnel
shall be subject to review by the Commissioner, and if any new officer,
shareholder, partner or liquor manager is ineligible for a license, the license
shall terminate.
   (F)   A person convicted of a violation of the requirements established
herein shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $750;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the right of the
Commissioner to suspend or revoke the license pursuant to the provisions of §
111.037 of this subchapter.

§ 111.016 CHANGE OF LOCATION.
   (A)   A retail liquor dealer°s license shall permit the sale of alcoholic
liquor only in the premises described in the application for the license. Such
location may be changed only upon written permission of the Commissioner to
make such change, and upon receipt of any required permits or approvals from
the Community Development Department.
   (B)   No change of location shall be permitted unless the proposed new
location is a proper one for the retail sale of alcoholic liquor under the laws
of the state, and under the ordinances of the city, including the City’s zoning
code. The fee for permission for a change of location shall be $1,000. No
additional license fee shall be payable, unless the change in location is
accompanied by a change in type of license (See §
111.010(G)), but a new license shall be issued to reflect the new location.
(Ord. 02-44, passed 11-26-02; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 111.017 CHANGE IN FLOOR PLAN OR FOCUS OF LOCAL OPERATION.
   (A)   During the term of any license issued for the sale of alcoholic liquor
for consumption on the premises, if a licensee proposes to make any change
which would alter its operation from the conditions pursuant to which the
license was initially granted, including any change in any required floor plan
or in the type and focus of the theme, decor, motif, advertising or menu for
the licensed business, in any manner which would promote the sale of alcoholic
liquor or of the entertainment available on the premises as opposed to the
availability of food service, or which would change the ratio of alcohol sales
to other activities on the licensed premises by more than 10%, the licensee
shall apply in writing to the Commissioner for approval of such changes, shall
apply to the Community Development Department for any required permits or
approvals of such changes, and shall provide information concerning the
specific changes proposed, including a revised floor plan, if any.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for approval of any of the changes as
provided in paragraph (A) of this section, the Commissioner shall review the
licensee’s proposed changes and the report of the Community Development
Department in order to determine the nature and significance of the changes in
consideration of the classification of the license held and the requirements
established for such classification. The Commissioner may approve the proposed
changes if it is determined that the proposed changes in the floor plan, the
nature and focus of the operation, the menu, the type and focus of advertising
for the licensed business, and the ratio of alcohol sales to other activities
on the premises is not so substantial as to make questionable the continued
conformance of the licensed premises with the requirements of this subchapter
for the license classification, and that such proposed changes conform with the
requirements of all other ordinances of the city, including the city’s zoning
code. If it is determined that the proposed changes are substantial, the
Commissioner shall notify the licensee in writing that the changes are so
substantial as to make questionable the continued conformance of the licensed
premises with the requirements of this subchapter for the license
classification, or with the requirements of other ordinances of the city,
including the zoning code, and that such changes will not be permitted.
   (C)   The fee for any application request for approval of changes on
licensed premises as provided in paragraph (A) hereof shall be $500. No
additional license fee shall be payable, and no new license shall be required
by virtue of the changes described in paragraph (A) hereof, unless the changes
referred to in this section are accompanied by a change in type of license (See
§
111.010(G)).
   (D)   So long as an application for approval of any of the changes described
in paragraph (A) hereof is pending, and not yet acted on by the Commissioner,
the applicant may continue to conduct its business and operations in the manner
approved at the time the license was initially granted. If approval of the
proposed changes is granted, the licensee may proceed to implement such changes
in accordance with the approval granted, and subject to any conditions which
may be established as part of such approval. If approval is denied, the
licensee shall continue to operate its business in the manner approved at the
time the license was initially granted.
   (E)   Any licensed business which implements any of the changes on licensed
premises as provided in paragraph (A) hereof, without requesting and receiving
approval of the Commissioner as provided therein, shall be subject to penalties
for violation of this subchapter, as established in §
111.037 of this subchapter, up to and including revocation of the license.
(Ord. 02-44, passed 11-26-02; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 111.018 CESSATION OF BUSINESS.
   Any licensee who has ceased to do business or closes its place of business
for a period of more than 30 successive days, without written permission

   (B)   Every act or omission, of whatsoever nature, that constitutes a
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, by any officer, director,
manager, employee, massage therapist, or other agent of any massage
establishment licensee, shall be deemed and held to be the act of such
licensee, and such licensee shall be punishable in the same manner as if the
act or omission had been committed or omitted by the licensee personally.
Accordingly, any such act or omission by any such persons that constitutes a
violation of the provisions of this chapter, shall, for purposes of determining
whether the licensee’s massage establishment license should be revoked,
suspended or renewed, be deemed to be the act or omission of the licensee.
   (C)   The city may suspend a license for a period not to exceed 30 days, if
it is determined that the licensee, or any employee of a licensee, has violated
or is not in compliance with this chapter, the city’s building and zoning
codes, or other codes and ordinance or regulations of the city, county or the
State of Illinois. In addition, the Mayor or a designee may order the immediate
suspension of all massage activities at any massage establishment pending a
hearing hereunder, if the administrator determines that there is an immediate
danger to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the license had been
suspended within the previous 48 months. The Mayor or a designee may also
condition any requested continuance of the hearing hereunder upon temporary
suspension of the business of the massage establishment.
   (D)   The city may suspend or revoke a license if it is determined that:
      (1)   A licensee violates or is not in compliance with this chapter, the
city’s building and zoning codes, or other codes and ordinances or regulations
of the city, county or State of Illinois;
      (2)   A licensee gave false or misleading information in the material
submitted to the city during the application process;
      (3)   A licensee knowingly allows any specified criminal act or any

a period of time;
      (5)   An individual or individuals on the licensed premises commits and
is convicted of any specified criminal act, as defined herein, which
substantially occurred in or about such licensed premises, and the individual
or individuals convicted were either employees of the licensee or were under
the supervision or control of the licensee at the time the offense(s) was
committed. The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on
the revocation of the license;
      (6)   A licensee is delinquent in payment to the city for ad valorem
taxes, water charges or sales taxes related to the massage establishment; or
      (7)   A licensee authorizes, approves, or, as a result of the licensee’s
negligent failure to supervise the licensed premises, allows an employee,
patron or any other person to violate any of the provisions or requirements of
this chapter or the provisions or requirements of the license issued pursuant
hereto.
   (E)   When the city revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one
year and the licensee shall not be issued a license for one year from the date
revocation became effective. If, subsequent to revocation, the city finds that
the basis for the revocation has been corrected or abated, an applicant may be
granted a license, if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the period
of revocation was completed.
   (F)   If the city Mayor shall notify the licensee in writing that its
license will be suspended or revoked, setting forth the reasons therefor, and

requested, the notice shall become final and effective on the eleventh business
day following receipt of the notice by the licensee. Any hearing shall be
conducted by the Mayor or a designee. The purpose of the hearing will be to
offer the licensee an opportunity to show cause why the license should not be
suspended or revoked. A record shall be made of the public hearing, by
electronic recording or otherwise as determined by the Mayor or a designee, and
documents may be submitted and/or testimony given, either in person or through
sworn affidavit. The Mayor or a designee shall have the power to administer
oaths and to continue the hearing from time to time to permit the licensee to
provide additional information. Within 28 days of the close of the hearing, the
Mayor or a designee shall, render a decision containing written findings of
fact and issue an appropriate order. A copy of such order shall be promptly
served upon the licensee. If the Mayor or a designee determines that the
license should be revoked or suspended, the suspension or revocation shall take
effect immediately upon receipt unless otherwise specified in the order. The
decision of the Mayor or a designee shall be the final administrative action of
the city with respect to the license, and shall be subject to immediate appeal
to the Circuit Court. Such appeal to the Circuit Court shall be filed by the
licensee not later than 35 days following receipt of the Mayor or a designee’s
findings and order. Failure to file timely such appeal as provided herein shall
render the Mayor or a designee’s decision final.

of the Field Inspection Report at the time of inspection, which shall identify
any violations of the Property Maintenance Code, or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders or determination of the
Director of Community and Economic Development and provide an appropriate

Certificate shall remain in effect during such time. If required, a re-
inspection shall be conducted to assure full compliance with the Property
Maintenance Code, or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations,
or the orders or determination of the Director of Community and Economic
Development.
      (2)   If the inspection or any subsequent re-inspection indicates full
compliance with the Property Maintenance Code, or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders or determination of the
Director of Community and Economic Development, the Director of Community and
Economic Development shall issue a Residential Rental Certificate.

corrected by the owner or managing agent within 30 days, the Director of
Community and Economic Development shall deny the issuance of a Residential
Rental Certificate and shall provide the owner or managing agent with a copy of
the last Field Inspection Report identifying the violations to be corrected. If
the owner or managing agent can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director
of Community and Economic Development that a hardship exists, the Director of
Community and Economic Development may extend the period within which the
violations are to be corrected an additional 30 days. If any violation
identified in the Field Inspection Report is not corrected within the

Development may issue a “Notice of Violation/Citation.”
   (C)   If the owner or managing agent cited as stated above is convicted of
such a violation(s), the penalty shall be not less than $150 and not more than
$1,000, and each day that the violation continues shall be deemed a separate
violation. If a licensee is convicted of a violation of this chapter, the
rental dwelling license may be suspended or revoked as provided in division (D)
of this section.
   (D)   In addition to the penalties provided for in division (C) of this
section, if compliance with the Property Maintenance Code, or other applicable
laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders or determination of the
Director of Community and Economic Development, is not achieved within the
required time, as stated by the “Notice of Violation/Citation,” the rental
dwelling license may be suspended by the Director of Community and Economic
Development. The owner or managing agent may, within seven days after notice of
such suspension, make a written request for a post-suspension hearing with the
City Administrator, after which the City Administrator may grant additional
time to correct the violation or revoke the license. In the event that the
Director of Community and Economic Development determines that there is an
emergency condition that causes a hazard to life, health, or safety, the
Director of Community and Economic Development may immediately suspend the
license.
   (E)   The imposition of any penalty pursuant to divisions (C) or (D) of this
section shall not preclude the city from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or
maintenance; to restrain, correct, or abate a violation; to prevent the
occupancy of a building, dwelling, or dwelling unit; or to require compliance
with the provisions of the Property Maintenance Code, or other applicable laws,

Council upon the recommendation of the City Administrator, after giving the
franchisee or permittee 60 days' notice in writing of intention to revoke such
franchise or permit, and after a hearing.

      (2)   Discovery may be obtained only through written requests to produce

itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible
persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of
the existence of any common law or statute that might make improper the
admission of evidence over objection in a civil action. Hearsay may support a
finding of the Liquor Commissioner if it is the best evidence available, has
sufficient indicia of trustworthiness and reliability and is of the type
reasonably and customarily relied on in the video gaming industry.

Riverboat Gambling Act relating to all licensed applicants, official Illinois
Gaming Board records or certified copies of the records shall be admissible

her case. The applicant shall not be permitted to introduce into evidence any
information that the city has not been afforded the opportunity to investigate

      (2)   The parties should, to the fullest extent possible, stipulate to
all matters that are not or fairly should not be in dispute.
      (3)   The parties may make objections to evidentiary offers. When an
objection is made, the Liquor Commissioner may receive the disputed evidence
subject to a ruling at a later time.
      (4)   The Liquor Commissioner may take official notice of any generally
accepted information or technical or scientific matter within the field of

reasonable opportunity to refute that information.

      (2)   If an applicant fails to testify on his or her own behalf with
respect to any question propounded to him or her, the Liquor Commissioner may
infer that such testimony or answer would have been adverse to the petitioner’s
case.
      (3)   Failure of an applicant to appear at a hearing or scheduled
proceeding shall constitute an admission of all matters and facts contained in

         (d)   Offers of proof, objections and rulings.
      (2)   Upon conclusion of the hearing the Liquor Commissioner shall review
the entire record and shall render a written order including written findings
of fact and conclusions of law on which the Liquor Commissioner's decision is
based. The findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on
matters officially noticed.

this section shall be considered an applicant for purposes of compliance with
applicable statutory provisions and this chapter until final resolution of the

or within three months of applying for a rental dwelling license renewal shall
attend and complete the crime free housing seminar. The provisions of this
section shall not apply to owners of rental residential property where all of
the occupants of the rental property are related to the property owner by blood
or marriage.
(Ord. 18-32, passed 9-11-18; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 125.04 CRIME FREE LEASE ADDENDUM.
   (A)   All leases or rental agreements for single-family and multiple-family
rental residential premises shall be in writing and shall contain the city
crime free lease addendum or have a clause or provision in the lease which
includes the language of the crime free lease addendum. The Crime Free Rental
Residential Housing Program Coordinator shall provide, at no cost to the
lessor, or to the lessor's manager or agent, a copy of the crime free lease
addendum. The crime free lease addendum shall also be available on the city's
website. For purposes of this section, a crime free lease addendum or similar
lease provision is a provision which makes it a material violation of a lease
for a lessee, an occupant of the premises, a guest of the lessee or for any
other party residing or present on the premises of a rental residential
property with the permission or consent of the owner or person in control of
the property to engage in, facilitate or conspire to commit or commit any
criminal activity or offense detailed in §
125.07 while on the leased premises or any common area of the leased premises.
The crime free lease addendum shall provide that commission of any offenses set
forth in §
125.07 shall be a material breach of the terms and covenants of the lease and
shall further provide the lessor or lessor's agent with authority to evict the
lessee in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Forcible Entry and
Detainer Act, ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 9-101 et seq., if it is established by a
preponderance of the evidence by a court of competent jurisdiction, that a
violation of the crime free lease addendum has occurred.
   (B)   Victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, dating violence or
stalking shall not be named defendants or evicted due to violations of the
crime free lease addendum.

§ 125.05 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.
   Owners, managers, and/or leasing agents shall not be required to perform or
require lessees to submit to criminal background checks. It is, however,
recommended that all prospective lessees of rental residential property be
required to submit to criminal background checks, credit checks, and checks for
past evictions prior to entering into a lease agreement. The decision whether
or not to lease to a tenant should not be based solely on the fact that the
prospective tenant has been convicted of a crime, without further inquiry as to
whether or not the arrest record actually reflects that person's conduct. Other
factors to consider from a prospective tenant's arrest record, when deciding to
lease to him or her, is how old the records might be, or whether the conduct is
relevant to the person's current ability to be a good tenant. Landlords should
not impose strict bans on prospective tenants on the basis of the fact that
they have a criminal background without making an individualized assessment of
the circumstances surrounding the offenses on the person's record and giving
the person an opportunity to explain the details of the arrest and/or
conviction if any.

party shall be permitted to rebut such evidence. No continuances shall be
authorized by the administrative hearing officer in proceedings under this
section unless for good cause shown or except where a continuance is absolutely

      (3)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative hearing
officer shall make a determination on the basis of the evidence presented at

commence an action in the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit of
DuPage County, Illinois, for a determination that the property is a chronic
nuisance property and/or to abate the chronic nuisance.
      (2)   The court may, upon a finding that a chronic nuisance exists
without notice or bond, enter a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
injunction or permanent injunction to enjoin any defendant from maintaining
such chronic nuisance property and may enter an order restraining any defendant
named from occupying, using or interfering with all property used in connection
with the chronic nuisance property. In addition, the court may impose fines as
provided by this code.
   (B)   Affirmative defense. It shall be an affirmative defense by the
property owner(s) of rental or leased property to an action brought to the city
that the owner of the property, manager(s) or person(s) in charge, at the time
in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence,
determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance property, or could
not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the
conduct of tenants or others in possession leading to the findings that the
property is a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise
of reasonable care and diligence, obtain an order for possession of the
property, pursuant to the provisions of the Forcible Entry and Detainer Act
(ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§9-101 et seq.).
   (C)   Remedy.
      (1)   In the event a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against
all use and occupancy for a period of not less than 30 days, but not more than
180 days or the court may employ any other remedy deemed by it appropriate to
abate the nuisance, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief. In
addition, the court may impose upon the owner of the property a civil penalty
in the amount of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 per day for each day
the person who owns or is otherwise in control of the property had actual
knowledge of the condition that caused the property to be a public nuisance
property and permitted the condition to remain. In determining what remedy or
remedies to employ, the court may consider evidence of other conduct, which has
occurred on the property, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   The disturbance of neighbors;
         (b)   The occurrence of other criminal activity or nuisance activity
at, on or from the property;
         (c)   Physical damage to the property in question or surrounding
properties;
         (d)   Any hazard posed to any occupant of the property or adjoining
property occupant or owner resulting from the physical condition of the
property in question or its structures;

otherwise in control of the property to mitigate or correct the problem at the
property;
         (f)   Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous;
         (g)   The magnitude or gravity of the problem;
         (h)   The cooperation of the person who owns or is otherwise in
control of the property with the city's enforcement efforts; and
         (i)   The cost incurred by the city investigating and correcting or
attempting to correct the condition.
      (2)   The court may authorize the city to physically secure the property
against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time
specified by the court. In the event that the city is authorized to secure the
property, all costs reasonably incurred by the city to effect the closure shall
be made and assessed as a lien against the property and debt owed to the city.
As used herein, "costs" means those costs actually incurred by the city for the
physical securing of the property. The official or employee of the city
effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs. The city shall
thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If the statement
is approved by the court, in whole or in part, as the case may be, a lien in
said amount may be recorded against said property. Any person who is assessed
the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally
liable for the payment thereof to the city.

      (2)   The average person, applying contemporary adult community
standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or
perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions, or lewd
exhibition of the genitals; and
      (3)   Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
   (C)   Interpretation of evidence.
      (1)   Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults except
that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially
susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the
circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience.
      (2)   Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale,
dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being
commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is
probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the
conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
      (3)   In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence
shall be admissible to show:
         (a)   The character of the audience for which the material was
designed or to which it was directed;
         (b)   What the predominant appeal of the material would be for
ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would
probably have on the behavior of such people;
         (c)   The artistic, literary, scientific, educational, or other merits
of the material, or absence thereof;
         (d)   The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this
state;
         (e)   Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising
or other promotion of the material;
         (f)   Purpose of the author, creator, publisher, or disseminator.
   (D)   Permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer an intent to
disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold,
engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for
reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of
obscene material.
   (E)   Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity
that the dissemination:
      (1)   Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than
children under 18 years of age;
      (2)   Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other
special justification for possession of such material.

dumbwaiter, escalator, moving sidewalk, platform lift, stairway chairlift or
automated people mover.
   (B)   All conveyances within the city shall register and pay the associated
fee to the Office of the State Fire Marshal ("OSFM"), and the city shall
cooperate with the OSFM to put conveyances that are not registered out of
service and to report to the OSFM the names of the owners of conveyances that
fail to register, within 30 days after the city has determined that a
conveyance is not registered.
   (C)   (1)   Prior to use, all conveyances shall be inspected and issued a
certificate of operation. After the initial installation and inspection of a
conveyance, it shall be inspected annually, except that a certificate of
operation is renewable every three years for a conveyance:
         (a)   That is located in a building owned and occupied by any church,
synagogue or other building, structure, or place used primarily for religious
worship and is the only conveyance in the building;
         (b)   That is under the jurisdiction of the city;
         (c)   That is limited in use to two levels; and
         (d)   For which the church, synagogue or other building, structure or
place used primarily for religious worship has an annual maintenance
examination that includes the applicable category tests.
      (2)   For these occupancies, on-site witnessing of the category test
shall be witnessed every three years. Records of the applicable maintenance
checks and elevator category test results shall be maintained on-site by the
building owner. The inspections shall be conducted by a certified elevator
inspector of the city or with whom the city has by contractual agreement
arranged for inspections to be conducted. Conveyances must successfully pass
all required tests and inspections. Following an inspection or reinspection, if
the conveyance is found to comply with the applicable standards for
conveyances, the city shall send to the property owner a certificate of
operation and an invoice for the inspection fee. The certificate of operation
shall be valid for a period not to exceed 12 months unless suspended or
revoked. The certificate of operation shall be posted in a conspicuous location
on the conveyance and shall be framed with a transparent cover.
   (D)   If the conveyance is found not to comply with the applicable standards
for conveyances, the city shall send to the property owner an inspection report
describing the deficiencies and an invoice for the inspection fee. Violations
of the applicable standards for conveyances noted in the inspection report
shall be corrected and the conveyance reinspected within 30 days following the
issuance of the inspection report.
   (E)   Whenever the city determines from the results on any inspection that,
in the interest of public safety, a conveyance is in an unsafe condition, the
city may seal the conveyance, revoke a certificate of operation and/or order
that its use be discontinued until the city determines by inspection that the
conveyance has been satisfactorily repaired or replaced so that the conveyance
may be operated in a safe manner. The city may suspend or revoke any
certificate of operation if it finds that the conveyance is not in compliance
with the applicable standards for conveyances. Any conveyance operated without
a current valid certificate of operation shall be deemed unsafe for purposes of
this section.
   (F)   It shall be unlawful to:
      (1)   Operate a conveyance without a current valid certificate of
operation;
      (2)   Operate a conveyance that has been sealed or the use of which has
been ordered to be discontinued prior to the city's determining by inspection
that the conveyance has been satisfactorily repaired or replaced so that the
conveyance may be operated in a safe manner;
      (3)   Falsify a certificate of operation;
      (4)   Refuse to allow an inspector access to the conveyance or its
equipment for inspection; or
      (5)   Fail to correct violations of the applicable standards for

§ 152.06 FEE IN LIEU OF COMPLIANCE VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances may be considered by the city's Stormwater Oversight
Committee, and granted or denied, in its sole discretion, to permit payment of
a detention fee and/or a BMP fee in lieu of compliance with the detention and
BMP requirements of the DuPage County Stormwater and Flood Plain Ordinance
adopted for the city in §
152.01 of this chapter, and such fee shall be determined in accordance with
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, respectively, but only under the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Where site detention facilities and/or BMP's are to be constructed
or installed off the property for which the variance is requested, and are
located in the same watershed planning area as such property or within the
city; and
      (2)   Where the Stormwater Oversight Committee determines that the fee in
lieu of compliance variance is consistent with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, that required detention or BMP improvements cannot reasonably
be constructed or installed on the property for which the variance is requested
so that it is necessary and appropriate to grant a fee in lieu of compliance
variance to permit such improvements to be constructed or installed off such
property to serve such property and other properties within the same watershed
planning area as such property or within the city, and that the development
meets the requirements specified in Section 15-112 of the DuPage County
Stormwater and Flood Plain Ordinance as well as the following conditions:
         (a)   Granting the variance shall not alter the essential character of
the area involved, including existing stream uses;
         (b)   Carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter
would create an undue or particular hardship or difficulty on a specific
developer or owner;
         (c)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary, and there are no
means other than the requested variance by which the alleged hardship can be
avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit the reasonable
continuation of the development;
         (d)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general condition or problem; and
         (e)   The subject development is exceptional as compared to other
developments subject to the same requirements.
   (B)   If a fee in lieu of detention compliance variance is granted, the fee
shall be paid to the city and shall be determined in accordance with one of the
following criteria, based on which the city's Stormwater Administrator
determines to be most appropriate for the particular proposed development.
      (1)   A fee calculated by multiplying the per acre-foot cost of the
closest off-site storage facility times the varied storage where:
         (a)   A design concept plan for such a facility has been approved by
the City Council and includes an estimate of the per acre-foot cost of
constructing the storage, including operation and maintenance costs; and
         (b)   A formula has been developed to determine that any investment in
such a facility will be at least equal to the cost of planning, acquiring
lands, constructing, operating and maintaining such facility; or
      (2)   A set fee for the Salt Creek watershed of $133,000 per acre-foot,
which is determined to be a reasonable and rational cost to provide site runoff
storage in the same watershed planning area as the property for which the
variance is requested or within the city, and to include the costs of planning,
acquiring land, construction, operation and maintenance.
   (C)   If a fee in lieu of BMP compliance variance is granted, the fee shall
be paid to the city and shall be determined based on the following:
 
Single or two-family residential land uses                     $3,000 per acre
Religious institutions defined under Sec. 1540 of the Illinois
Property Tax Code and governmental entities, not to include    $3,000 per acre
roadways and parking lots
Multiple-family or non-residential uses                        $15,000 per acre
Roadway developments                                           $30,000 per acre
 
   (D)   Funds collected for fee in lieu of compliance variances shall be
accounted for in separate project or watershed planning area accounts, and such
accounting records shall be made available to the DuPage County Stormwater
Committee upon its request. Such funds shall be used only as follows:
      (1)   In the case of a fee in lieu of detention compliance variance, only
to enhance existing off-site runoff storage facilities and related components,
construct off-site stormwater facilities and related components, provide for
maintenance of off-site stormwater facilities, or undertake other development
that provides a watershed benefit.
      (2)   In the case of a fee in lieu of BMP compliance variance, only to
enhance existing off-site BMP improvements and related components, install off-
site BMP improvements and related components, provide for maintenance of off-
site BMP improvements, or undertake other development that provides a watershed
benefit.
   (E)   All payments made for fee in lieu of compliance variances shall be
refunded to the person who paid the fee, or to such person's successor in
interest, if the city fails to encumber such fees for a specific purpose within
ten years after the date on which such fees were collected; provided that such
fees shall be refunded only if the person who paid the fees, or such person's
successor in interest, files a written petition with the city for such refund
within one year from the date by which such fees are required to be encumbered.

§ 155.06 STANDARDS FOR REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Standards for review of replacement structures, new construction,
additions and alterations. In considering an application for a certificate of
appropriateness for replacement structures, new construction, additions and
alterations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider only the
following general standards, specific design guidelines, if any, accompanying
the ordinance designating the landmark, or historic district, and the standards
included in this section, as relevant and applicable.
      (1)   Height. Height shall be visually compatible with properties,
structures, sites, public ways, objects, and places to which it is visibly
related.
      (2)   Proportion of front facade. The relationship of the width to the
height of the front elevation shall be visually compatible with properties,
structures, sites, public ways, objects, and places to which it is visually
related.
      (3)   Proportion of openings. The relationship of the width to height of
windows and doors shall be visually compatible with properties, structures,
sites, public ways, objects, and places to which the building is visually
related.
      (4)   Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of
solids to voids in the front facade of a structure shall be visually compatible
with properties, structures, sites, public ways, objects, and places to which
it is visually related.
      (5)   Rhythm of spacing and structures on streets. The relationship of a
structure or object to the open space between it and adjoining structures or
objects shall be visually compatible with the properties, structures, sites,
public ways, objects, and places to which it is visually related.
      (6)   Rhythm of entrance porches, storefront recesses and other
projections. The relationship of entrances and other projections to sidewalks
shall be visually compatible with the properties, structures, sites, public
ways, objects, and places to which it is visually related.
      (7)   Relationship of materials and texture. The relationship of the
materials and texture of the facade shall be visually compatible with the
predominant materials used in the structures to which it is visually related.
      (8)   Roof shapes. The roof shape of a structure shall be visually
compatible with the structures to which it is visually related.
      (9)   Walls of continuity. Facades and property and site structures, such
as masonry walls, fences, and landscape masses, shall, when it is a
characteristic of the area, form cohesive walls of enclosure along a street, to
ensure visual compatibility with the properties, structures, sites, public
ways, objects, and places to which such elements are visually related.
      (10)   Scale of a structure. The size and mass of structures in relation
to open spaces, windows, door openings, porches, adjacent structures, and
balconies shall be visually compatible with the properties, structures, sites,
public ways, objects, and places to which they are visually related.
      (11)   Directional expression of front elevation. A structure shall be
visually compatible with the properties, structures, sites, public ways,
objects, and places to which it is visually related in its directional
character, whether this be vertical character, horizontal character, or
nondirectional character.
      (12)   Preserving distinguishing features. The distinguishing original
qualities or character of a property, structure, site or object and its
environment shall not be destroyed or adversely affected in a material way. The
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (13)   Protection of resources. Every reasonable effort shall be made to
protect and preserve archaeological and natural resources affected by, or
adjacent to any project.
      (14)   New construction. In considering new construction, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall not impose a requirement for the use of a single
architectural style or period, though it may impose a requirement for
consistency with the chosen style.
      (15)   Repair to deteriorated features. Deteriorated architectural
features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible, in
accordance with the Secretary of the Interior Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Properties. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
need not be identical to but should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
      (16)   Surface cleaning. The surface cleaning of historic material and
distinctive architectural features shall be undertaken with the gentlest means
possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the
historically, visually, aesthetically, culturally or archaeologically
significant materials shall not be undertaken.
      (17)   Reversibility of Additions and Alterations. Wherever possible,
additions or alterations to historic properties shall be done in such manner
that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic property would not be impaired.
   (B)   Standards for review of demolitions. In considering an application for
a certificate of appropriateness for demolition, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall consider only the following general standards, the Secretary
of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Properties, as amended,
and the standards included in §
155.06(A).
      (1)   Whether the property, structure or object is of such historic,
cultural, architectural or archaeological significance that its demolition
would be detrimental to the public interest and contrary to the general welfare
of the people of the city and the State of Illinois.
      (2)   Whether the property, structure or object contributes to the
distinctive historic, cultural, architectural or archeological character of the
historic district as a whole and should be preserved for the benefit of the
people of the city and the State of Illinois.
      (3)   Whether demolition of the property, structure or object would be
contrary to the purpose and intent of this chapter and to the objectives of the
historic preservation for the applicable historic district.
      (4)   Whether the property, structure or object is of such old, unusual
or uncommon design, texture, and/or material that it could not be reproduced
without great difficulty and/or expense.
      (5)   Except in cases where the owner has no plans for a period of up to
five years to replace an existing Landmark or property, structure or object in
a historic district, no certificate of appropriateness shall be issued until
plans for a replacement structure or object have been reviewed and approved by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 13-22, passed 4-23-13)
§ 155.07 EXCEPTIONS TO ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.

disagrees with the plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the
right to delay the proposal 60 days by submitting a delay request. During the
delay period, the Planning and Zoning Commission may develop alternative plans
for consideration. If after 60 days no such alternative plans can be developed,
the proposed alteration, construction, demolition, or relocation may proceed as
ordered.

passed 5-13-14; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 156.022 AMENDMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. It is recognized that public necessity, convenience, general
welfare and good zoning practice will, from time to time, require amendment of
the regulations contained in this chapter and of the classifications of
properties as shown on the official zoning map. It is the purpose of this
section to define the procedures required to effect these changes.
   (B)   Authority.
      (1)   The City Council may enact, by ordinance, an amendment or change in
the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   The City Council may enact, by ordinance, a change in zoning
district classification or a district boundary change for all or part of the
property described in the petition. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
likewise recommend and the City Council may enact, by ordinance, a zoning
district classification other than that requested in the petition, provided
that the recommendation or ordinance for a district classification are of the
same general type as that requested by the petitioner and are at least as
restrictive as the classification requested in the petition.
   (C)   In case of written protest against any proposed zoning district
reclassification or boundary change, signed and acknowledged by the owners of
20% of the frontage immediately adjoining or across a lot therefrom, or by the
owners of 20% of the frontages directly opposite from the frontage proposed to
be altered, such reclassification or change shall not be approved by the City
Council except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of the aldermen of the city
then holding office.
   (D)   Effect of denial. After a public hearing, no petition shall be
resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for an amendment to the
regulations contained in this chapter, or a change in zoning district
boundaries or classification of property that has been denied wholly or in part
by the City Council shall be resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for a period of one year from the date of the order of denial, except on the
grounds of substantial new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be
valid by the City Council. If the City Council finds that there is substantial
new evidence or proof of changed conditions, it shall refer the matter to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for a new hearing pursuant to proper legal
notice.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 10-9-07)
§ 156.023 VARIATIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. In cases where there are practical difficulties or particular
hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of any of the
regulations adopted by the ordinance, the City Council may, by ordinance,
determined to vary the application fo such regulations in harmony with their
general purpose and intent, and in accordance with the general or specific
rules herein contained.
   (B)   Authority. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall not recommend a
variation, and the City Council shall not vary the provisions of the ordinance
as authorized in this section, unless findings have been made based upon
evidence presented that clearly demonstrates the following:
      (1)   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations
governing the district in which it is located.
      (2)   That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances not of
its own creation.
      (3)   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential
character of the locality.
   (C)   Extraordinary vote by City Council. Any proposed variation which fails
to receive a recommendation for approval from the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall not be approved by the City Council except by the favorable
vote of two-thirds of the aldermen of the city.
   (D)   Effect of denial. After a public hearing, no petition shall be
resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a variation that has been
denied wholly or in part by the City Council, for a period of one year from the
date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of substantial new evidence
or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the City Council. If the
City Council finds that here is substantial new evidence or proof of changed
conditions, it shall refer the petition to the Planning and Zoning Commission
for a new hearing pursuant to proper legal notice.
   (E)   Time limit. Any variation granted hereunder shall be subject to
termination if no building permit has been issued within one year from the date
a variation is approved; provided, however, that upon written application,
extensions of not to exceed one year for each extension authorized may be
granted by the City Council.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 10-9-07)
§ 156.024 SPECIAL USES.
   (A)   Purpose. The regulations contained in this chapter are based upon the
division of the city into zoning districts, within any one of which the use of
land and buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures as
related to the land, are essentially uniform. It is recognized, however, that
there are special uses which, because of their unique character, cannot be
properly classified in any particular district or districts without a case-by-
case consideration of the impact of those uses upon neighboring lands, the
public need for the particular use at the particular location, and the ability
of the city or other public agencies to supply the special uses with various
community services, such as adequate treatment of waste water, adequate supply
of potable water, fire protection, police protection, maintenance of street
rights-of-ways, and proper traffic safety. Such special uses fall into the
following two categories:
      (1)   Uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities,
or uses traditionally affected with a public interest.
      (2)   Uses entirely private in character but of such a nature that the
operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
neighboring property and public facilities.
   (B)   Authority. The City Council, after receiving the report of the
Planning and Zoning Commission and without further public hearing, may grant or
deny any proposed special use, or may refer the matter back to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for further consideration; provided that any proposed special
use which fails to receive the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall not be approved by the City Council except by a favorable majority vote
of two-thirds of all aldermen then holding office.
   (C)   Conditions. No special use or change to a special use shall be
recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission nor approved by the City
Council unless the special use:
      (1)   Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at the location.
      (2)   Will not be unreasonably detrimental to or endanger the public
health, safety, morals, comfort, or general welfare.
      (3)   Will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in
the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, or substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (4)   Will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement
of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
      (5)   Will provide adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other
important and necessary community facilities.
      (6)   Will conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which
it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by
the City Council.
   (D)   Restrictions. Prior to granting any special use, the Planning and
Zoning Commission may recommend, and the City Council may require that certain
conditions and restrictions be met for the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary
for the protection of the public interest in order to insure compliance with
the standards and requirements specified herein. In all cases in which a
special use is granted, the City Council shall require such evidence and
guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the special use is and will
comply with all conditions established in connection therewith.
   (E)   Effect of denial. After a public hearing, no petition shall be
resubmitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a special use that has
been denied wholly or in part by the City Council for a period of one year from
the date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of substantial new
evidence or proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the City Council.
If the City Council finds that there is substantial new evidence or proof of
changed conditions, it shall refer the petition to the Planning and Zoning
Commission for a new hearing pursuant to proper legal notice.
   (F)   Termination.
      (1)   A special use permit granted by the City Council shall be subject
to termination in the manner provided hereinbelow under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   Failure to commence construction of the proposed use within 18
months after the date of the granting of said special use. Construction shall
not be deemed to have commenced unless and until:
            1.   All necessary permits have been obtained;
            2.   All sites have been properly graded;
            3.   All foundations and footings are in place; and
            4.   All utilities have been provided for.
         (b)   Failure to carry the construction work forward expeditiously
with adequate forces for a period of 18 months out of a 24-month period.
         (c)   Following the issuance of occupancy permits, abandonment or
other failure to utilize the property for the purposes permitted by the special
use for a period of two months out of any consecutive six-month period.
         (d)   Upon written application, extensions of not to exceed one year
for each extension authorized may be granted by the City Council for any time
limit specified hereinabove.
      (2)   In determining whether the special use shall be terminated, the
Director of Community and Economic Development
shall consider the effect of changed conditions, if any, upon the property.
Where the property in question was granted a change in zoning classification
contemporaneously with its special use, or achieved such a use as part of an
annexation agreement, the Director of Community and Economic Development shall
consider whether the property would have been granted the zoning classification
underlying its special use if it were not for the conditions which were imposed
by the special use or by an annexation agreement, as the case may be. It is the
intent of this provision to prevent the rezoning of land to a less restrictive
category based upon the promise of development of a well-planned special use
subject to various conditions, followed by the abandonment of such use, and the
attempted development of the property without proper planning controls under a
zoning classification which would not have been granted, but for the
requirements imposed under the special use.
      (3)   During the time that the Director of Community and Economic
Development is considering the disposition of a special use which has prima
facie been abandoned in accordance with the time limit set forth in this
division (F), no permits shall be issued, and no buildings for which permits
have been previously issued shall be constructed until the final decision
regarding the future zoning of the property has been made.
(Ord. 07-13, passed 10-9-07; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 156.025 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose. Planned unit developments are special uses of such
substantially different character from other special uses that specific and
additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the
recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the action of the
City Council.
   (B)   Standards and exceptions.
      (1)   General standards. A planned unit development shall conform to the
following standards:
         (a)   The number of dwelling units erected shall not exceed the number
permitted by the regulations of the district in which it is located, unless an
exception is permitted as provided in division (B)(2) of this section.
         (b)   The yards and open spaces adjoining the boundaries of the
development shall not be less than the yard requirements of thedistrict in
which it is located unless an exception is permitted as provided in division
(B)(2) of this section.
         (c)   If more intensive uses are granted than are permitted by the
district regulations (i.e., uses other than those for which the district is
zoned, such as: B-3 General Retail District usage in an R-3 Multiple Family
District), there must be clear evidence that such uses are needed to serve the
development, and the Planning and Zoning Commission shall find:
            1.   That the uses permitted by such exceptions are necessary or
desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development;
            2.   That the uses permitted by such exception are not of such a
nature or so located as to exercise a detrimental influence on the development
or on the surrounding neighborhood;
            3.   That, except in the M-U Mixed Use District, not more than 15%
of the gross land area of residential planned unit developments is devoted to
the uses permitted by the exception;
            4.   That the use exceptions so allowed are established by
ordinances on file in the office of the City Clerk.
         (d)   The number of off-street parking spaces must meet the
requirements set forth in §
156.103, unless an exception thereto is granted as provided in division (B)(2)
of this section or permitted shared or valet parking is provided. The City
Council may require more off-street parking than is otherwise required by this
chapter.
         (e)   If any open space or recreational facility is to be used solely
by the residents or occupants of the development, a Declaration of Restrictions
and Covenants, to be approved by the city attorney, shall be recorded to
provide for assessments against the property within the development so that
such facilities can be properly improved, maintained and operated.
         (f)   All new utilities within the limits of a planned unit
development shall be underground. All existing utilities shall be relocated
underground unless an exception is permitted as provided in division (B)(2) of
this section. Appurtenances to utility systems may be excepted from this
requirement if the City Council finds that such appurtenances can be
effectively screened and that such exception will not violate the intent or
character of the development.
         (g)   In the event the owner shall include dwellings under §§ 235 or
236 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. §§ 17151(d)(3), 1715v(c)(3), 1715z,
1715z-1) or similar acts providing for low or moderate income housing or
housing for the elderly, or any act or section which may supersede them, those
units shall be equally distributed throughout the development and shall further
conform to the following requirements:
            1.   There shall be no less than 8% of such units and no more than
12% of such units in the development.
            2.   All support facilities for such units shall be equal to all
other units in the development, and the total area required for the planned
unit development shall be reduced by an amount equal to 12% of the total lot
area for units receiving assistance in financing.
         (h)   Standards for public improvements shall be governed by the
applicable ordinances and laws of the city.
      (2)   Bulk regulations exceptions. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
recommend, and the City Council may authorize, exceptions to the applicable
bulk regulations of this chapter within the boundaries of a planned unit
development, provided that the Planning and Zoning Commission shall find:
         (a)   That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of
encouraging a desirable living, working and playing environment no less
beneficial to the residents or occupants of such development, as well as of
neighboring properties, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of
this chapter for buildings developed on separate zoning lots.
         (b)   That the minimum open space in a residential planned unit
development shall be not less than 30% in the residential zoning districts.
         (c)   That no building shall exceed seven stories or 75 feet,
whichever is less.
         (d)   That the planned unit developments shall not be located on
parcels of land less than two acres in size; provided, however, that a
government planned unit development may be located on parcels of land less than
two acres but no less than one acre in size. A government planned unit
development shall be no less than 50% owned, operated or leased for lawful
public purposes within the powers of a division or agency of the United States,
any state thereof, or any county, municipality or other entity with powers
granted unto it under the laws of the State of Illinois.
         (e)   That other bulk standards for a planned unit development shall
meet the standards of the residential or business zoning district(s) most
similar in nature and function to the proposed planned unit development, as
determined by the City Council. However, in regard to developments containing
residential uses:
            1.   In no event shall the floor area ratio exceed more than 15%
over that prescribed in this chapter for the district in which it is located.
            2.   In no event shall the minimum square footage per dwelling unit
requirements applicable to such districts be decreased by more than 15%, and
such exception shall be granted only if one parking space per dwelling unit is
provided either underground or within the building proper.
         (f)   Exceptions to the standards of this chapter may be granted by
the City Council if it finds that such exceptions are warranted based upon the
total proposed development in accordance with the standards for special uses.
   (C)   Preliminary and final approval.
      (1)   Preliminary approval.
         (a)   The designation of certain property as a special use for a
planned unit development and approval of preliminary development plans for such
planned unit development, by ordinance approved by the City Council, shall be
valid for two years, during which time the applicant shall obtain City Council
approval of a final plan for the planned unit development or of certain phases
thereof. Upon written application, extensions of not to exceed one year for
each extension authorized may be granted by the City Council.
         (b)   The ordinance designating property as a planned unit development
and approving a preliminary development plan shall be recorded with the DuPage

      (2)   Final approval.
         (a)   An applicant for a planned unit development may file for final
approval, including designation of certain property as a special use for a
planned unit development and approval of final development plans for such
planned unit development, without first applying for preliminary approval.
         (b)   The procedure for securing final approval shall be the same as
in division (B)(1) of this section, but the plans shall be in more specific
detail, and final approval may be granted for all or only certain phases of
development.
         (c)   Final approval for all or any phase of a planned unit
development delineated in the schedule of construction approved by the City
Council, shall be valid for one year; provided that extensions of not to exceed
one year for each extension authorized may be granted by the City Council upon
a request made in writing prior to the expiration of the previous time limit.
         (d)   The ordinance granting final approval of a planned unit
development, any phase thereof, or any subsequent change or modification
thereto, shall constitute and be deemed, as a matter of law, to be the
agreement of the property owner, and its successors and assigns, that the
development will be carried out in substantial compliance with the approved
final development plan, or any change or modification thereto, including the
terms and conditions of approval of the ordinance approving such plan, and
within the time schedule approved by the City Council.
         (e)   If the final development plan submitted, for all or any phase of
a planned unit development, substantially conforms with the preliminary
development plan approved by the City Council, such plan shall be recommended
for approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission and shall be approved by the

         (f)   The ordinance designating property as a planned unit development
and approving a final development plan for all or any phase of the planned unit
development shall be recorded with the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds.
      (3)   Permits. Permits shall be issued for planned unit developments in
accordance with the following:
         (a)   Issuance. Upon City Council approval of the final development
plan for all or any phase of a planned unit development, the Director of
Community and Economic Development may issue the necessary permits for all or
for such phase thereof as have received final approval.
         (b)   Time limit. If no construction has been started under permits
issued within one year from the date of approval of the final development plan
for all or any approved phase of the development, and no extension to such time
limit has been requested by the petitioner and granted by the City Council, the
development shall be deemed abandoned, the approval of the final development
plan shall be deemed null and void and the development shall not proceed to
construction. Any further proposed plans for the development of the property
shall require proceedings for consideration by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and approval by the City Council, and the appropriate application
fees for a planned unit development shall be charged for such proceedings.
         (c)   As-built plans. Upon completion of all construction and final
inspection of all improvements in the planned unit development or any approved
phases thereof, and prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy, an as-
built site plan, landscape plan and topographical survey shall be provided as
evidence of compliance with all approved plans.
      (4)   Changes and modifications.
         (a)   Any substantial changes or modifications of the final
development plan shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission and
the City Council for review and approval. The application procedures shall be
as for a preliminary approval of a planned unit development. A substantial
change shall include, but not be limited to, any change that would modify the
location of a building or structure or add an additional accessory structure,
or any other change to the final plan, if such change would require an
exception from any requirements of this chapter; would alter the character and
aesthetics if the development, including building materials and the required
landscaping points, or would have an adverse impact on surrounding properties.
A modification of the location of a building or structure, and addition of an
accessory building or structure, or any other change to the final plan, shall
be deemed an insubstantial change if such change does not require any
additional exceptions, does not change the character and aesthetics of the
development, including building materials and the required landscaping points,
and does not cause any adverse impact on surrounding properties. An
insubstantial change may be authorized by the Director of Community and
Economic Development pursuant to a required permit.
         (b)   Permits shall not be issued by the Director of Community and
Economic Development for construction involving a proposed change or
modification to a planned unit development until the procedures set forth in
division (B)(4)(a) have been completed.
         (c)   Any ordinance approving changes or modifications to a final
development plan shall be on file with the City Clerk, and shall be recorded
with the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds.

Economic Development shall transmit to the Planning and Zoning Commission any
petition for an appeal from an order, requirement or decision of the
Administrator or other officer or department, together with all the documents

Director of Community and Economic Development from whose decisions such appeal
was taken.

appeal is taken, certifies to the Planning and Zoning Commission that, in the
opinion of the Administrator or such other officer of department, and by reason
of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would result in imminent peril to
life or property. In such a case, proceedings shall not be stayed except by a
restraining order granted by a court of record upon notice to the Director of
Community and Economic Development or other officer or department from whose
decision the appeal is taken, and on good cause shown.

administrative determination subject to review in accordance with the Illinois
Administrative Review Act ( ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq.).

nonconformities:
         (a)   Legal nonconforming uses of land and legal nonconforming uses in

      (3)   The burden of establishing the existence of a legal nonconforming
use, building, or structure is upon the property owner and not upon the city.
   (C)   Legal nonconforming uses of land and legal nonconforming uses in
conforming buildings or structures.
      (1)   Authority to continue. Except as provided in division (C)(9), any
existing legal nonconforming use of a premises not involving the use of a
building or structure, or involving only a conforming building or structure
that is accessory to a legal nonconforming use of land, or a legal

continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations
contained in divisions (C)(2) through (C)(8).
      (2)   Ordinary repair and maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls,
nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any
conforming building or structure that is accessory to a legal nonconforming use

provided, however, that this division (C)(2) shall not be deemed to authorize
any violation of divisions (C)(3) through (C)(9).
      (3)   Structural alteration. No conforming building or structure that is
accessory to a legal nonconforming use of land or that is devoted entirely to a
legal nonconforming use, and no portion of a conforming building or structure
that is devoted to a legal nonconforming use, shall be structurally altered
unless the use of such building or structure or portion thereof that is devoted
to a legal nonconforming use shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create any
new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree
of nonconformity with any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space
requirement for such building or structure.
      (4)   Enlargement of building or structure. No conforming building or
structure that is accessory to a legal nonconforming use of land or that is
devoted entirely to a legal nonconforming use, and no portion of a conforming
building or structure that is devoted to a legal nonconforming use, shall be
enlarged or added to in any manner, including the interior addition of floor
area, unless the use of such building or structure or portion thereof that is
devoted to a legal nonconforming use shall thereafter conform to the use
regulations of the district in which it is located. No such enlargement shall
create any new parking, loading, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase
the degree of nonconformity with any existing parking, loading, bulk, yard, or
space requirement for such building or structure.
      (5)   Expansion of legal nonconforming use. A legal nonconforming use of
land that does not involve a building or structure, a conforming building or
structure that is accessory to a legal nonconforming use of land, or a legal
nonconforming use in all or a portion of a conforming building or structure
shall not be expanded, extended, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such
prohibited activity shall include without being limited to:
         (a)   An expansion of such use, including its accessory uses, to any
building, structure, or land area other than that occupied by such legal
nonconforming use on December 23, 1980, or any subsequent changes to this
chapter that have caused such use to become nonconforming; and
         (b)   An expansion of such legal nonconforming use, including its
accessory uses, within a building or other structure to any portion of the
floor area that was not occupied by such legal nonconforming use on the
December 23, 1980, or any subsequent changes to this chapter that have caused
such use to become nonconforming.
      (6)   Moving. No conforming building or structure that is accessory to a
legal nonconforming use of land or that is devoted in whole or in part to a
legal nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless both the
building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter comply and conform
to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so
moved. No legal nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part,
for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other
lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located after being so moved.
         (7)   Change in use. A legal nonconforming use of land that does not
involve a building or structure, or that involves only a conforming building or
structure that is accessory to the legal nonconforming use of land, or a legal
nonconforming use in a conforming building or structure shall not be changed to
any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which the use,
building, or structure is located. When such a legal nonconforming use has been
changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to any
unlawful use.
      (8)   Damage or destruction. Any conforming building or structure that is
accessory to a legal nonconforming use of land or that is devoted in whole or
in part to a legal nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed, by any
means, to the extent of more than 50% of the cost of replacement of such

be provided for all landscape yards, and may include plant materials, fences,
walls and berms; provided that no credit toward the required landscape points
shall be given for solid walls or fences or berms less than two and one-half
feet in height. The type and number of plants and other features required shall
be determined using the following information:
         Number of points required for:
            A full landscape screen/buffer:
               Example:   Landscape yard = 100'
               Points required = Half the length x 10, or 50' x 10 - 500 points
         If the required amount of landscaping points is unable to be met, the
City of Oakbrook Terrace may accept a monetary contribution of $ 10.00 per
landscaping point in lieu of the required amount of landscaping points for
landscaping elsewhere in the City of Oakbrook Terrace.
      (3)   Perimeter side and rear yard where landscaping screen/buffer not
required. Where no landscaping screen/buffer is required, the side and/or rear
yard adjacent to a parking lot shall be, at a minimum, sodded, seeded, or
planted with another comparable ground cover.
      (4)   Number of plants required. Trees and shrubs shall generally have
the following point values:

         (b)   Tall shrubs (minimum 36" in height at installation): 15 points;
         (c)   Ornamental trees: 50 points;
         (d)   Evergreen trees: 60 points; and
         (e)   Shade trees: 100 points.
      (5)   Continuous or staggered berms of more than five feet in height,
which function as screening, may contribute up to 50% of the total landscape
points for that portion of a landscape yard. Berm heights of at least two and
one-half feet will obtain a credit based on the following:
            Berm height x 0.10 = % of points credited (.5' increments)
            Example:   Landscape yard = 100 feet
            100' long berm x 2.5' high x 0.10 = 25% of points credited
      (6)   The proposed landscaping must function so that maximum effective
screening is provided. Both overhead and lower screening and buffering shall be
required in order to meet these requirements, unless the Director of Community
and Economic Development determines that overhead screening and buffering would
unreasonably interfere with overhead utilities. Plant selection should include
a variety of plant types. Fences, walls or berms shall be used to increase
effective screening, but fences and solid walls shall not provide landscape
credits. Trees and shrubs should be used on berms and in front of fences and
walls.
            Example:   500 landscape points required:
            200 points - two shade trees
            100 points - two ornamental trees
            180 points - three evergreen trees
            20 points - two low shrubs
      (7)   Additional landscape screening/ buffering may be required when a
use occurs which may have a high impact on adjacent development, as determined
by the Director of Community and Economic Development. A high impact use is one
which is expected to have a strong effect on adjacent properties, due to one or
more of the following:
         (a)   Noise;
         (b)   Outdoor loading spaces;
         (c)   Exterior storage, attractive nuisances and objectionable views;
         (d)   Dust, fumes, odors and vibration;
         (e)   Litter;
         (f)   Bright lighting during the evening or at night or headlights
from vehicles using the development at night;
         (g)   Height of structures above the maximum permitted building height
for the specific zoning district, or adjacent to development in a different
zoning district or a zoning district with a lower maximum permitted building
height; or
         (h)   Safety and liability concerns.
   (I)   Parking lot requirements. The following requirements apply to all
parking lot landscaping:
      (1)   Interior parking lot landscaping. Interior parking lot landscaping
shall be required based on total lot area, minus area of the footprint of the
building, minus the area of the required yards. If such calculation results in
a remaining area of 10,000 square feet or greater, the parking lot must be
landscaped as follows:
         (a)   Area required. Not less than 5% of the interior of a parking lot
shall be devoted to landscaping. Landscaping areas located along the perimeter
of a parking lot, as required by division (I)(2) of this section, and
foundation landscaping areas shall not be included toward satisfying the
interior parking lot landscaping requirements.
         (b)   Landscaping required. The required interior parking lot
landscaping areas shall be as follows:
            1.   Planting islands shall be dispersed throughout the parking lot
in a design and configuration satisfactory to the Director of Community and
Economic Development.
            2.   Planting islands shall be a minimum of 120 square feet in area
and a minimum of seven feet in width, as measured from back of curb to back of
curb.
            3.   Plant material shall include shade tree species, and although
ornamental trees, shrubbery, hedges and other plant materials may be used to
supplement shade tree plantings, such plantings shall not be the sole
contribution to such landscaping. A minimum of one shade tree shall be provided
for every 120 square feet of landscaping area, and a minimum of 50% of every
interior parking lot landscaping area shall be improved with approved ground
cover, as determined by the Director of Community and Economic Development.
         (c)   Exception. In the event that the Director of Community and
Economic Development determines that the site geometry of the proposed parking
lot does not allow strict adherence to the above requirements, the Director of
Community and Economic Development may allow and require landscaped islands for
at least 10% of the parking lot area using alternate schemes.
      (2)   Perimeter parking lot landscaping. Perimeter parking lot
landscaping shall be required for all parking lots as follows:
         (a)   Where a parking lot is located within a required yard, or within
20 feet of a lot line, perimeter landscaping shall be required along the
corresponding edge of the parking lot. Where required, perimeter landscaping
shall be provided within landscape areas five feet in width, as measured from
back of curb, excluding any parking space overhang area.
         (b)   Where a parking lot is located across a dedicated public right-
of-way from property zoned or used for residential use, the following perimeter
landscaping requirements shall be applicable:
            1.   Continuous landscaping of evergreen or dense deciduous shrubs
shall be provided across 100% of the street frontage to a minimum height of
four feet. The height of such shrubs may be reduced if berming is provided so
that the combined height of shrubs and berming is not less than four feet. In
addition, shade or ornamental trees shall be provided within such landscape
area, and the number of trees shall be not less than one tree per 50 feet of
frontage, with the number of trees required, rounded to the nearest whole
number. Additional plantings may be provided, subject to the approval of the
Director of Community and Economic Development.
            2.   Except where occupied by planting beds, all landscaping areas
located in front yards shall be sodded or planted with another comparable
ground cover as determined appropriate by the Director of Community and
Economic Development.
         (c)   Where a parking lot is located across a dedicated public right-
of-way from property zoned or used for non-residential use, the following
perimeter landscaping requirements shall be applicable:
            1.   Landscaping of evergreen or dense deciduous shrubs shall be
provided across 50% of the street frontage to a minimum height of four feet).
The height of such shrubs may be reduced if berming is provided so that the
combined height of shrubs and berming is not less than four feet. Additional
plantings may be provided, subject to the approval of the Director of Community
and Economic Development.
            2.   Except where occupied by planting beds, all landscaping areas
located in front yards shall be sodded or planted with another comparable
ground cover, as determined by the Director of Community and Economic
Development.
         (d)   For rear and side yards, where a parking lot abuts property
zoned and used for non-residential uses, landscaping shall be provided across
50% of that portion of the parking lot abutting the property line to a minimum
height of four feet. The height of such shrubs may be reduced if berming is
provided so that the combined height of shrubs and berming is not less than
four feet. Such plantings shall be concentrated into shrub masses, typically
containing seven to nine shrubs per shrub mass. Additional plantings may be
provided, subject to the approval of the Director of Community and Economic
Development. Except where occupied by planting beds, all side and rear yard
perimeter parking lot landscaping shall be sodded, seeded or planted with
another comparable ground cover, as determined by the Director of Community and
Economic Development.

§ 156.051 ABOVE GROUND SERVICE FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is to
establish guidelines for the construction and placement of above ground service
facilities in the city; to encourage the location of above ground service
facilities in non-residential areas and minimize the total number of above
ground service facilities throughout the city; encourage users of above ground
service facilities to locate them, to the greatest extent possible, in areas
where the adverse impact is minimal; to encourage users of above ground service
facilities to configure them in a manner that minimizes the adverse visual
impact; and to provide the owners of above ground service facilities the
ability to provide such services to the city.
   (B)   Applicability. No above ground service facility shall be erected or
installed except in compliance with the provisions of this section. Above
ground service facilities located on property owned, leased or otherwise
controlled by the city shall be exempt from the requirements of this section;
provided that a lease, franchise, license or other written agreement is entered
to authorize such above ground service facilities. Where conflicts exist
between this section and the remaining of this chapter, the provisions of this
section shall govern.
   (C)   Building permit requirements. A building permit shall be required
prior to the installation of any above ground service facility. Applications
for a building permit for an above ground service facility shall include, in
addition to other requirements under
Chapter 150 of this Code, the following documents:
      (1)   A spotted survey, drawn to scale, of the lot upon which the above
ground service facility is to be constructed, showing thereon all existing
buildings and structures; the location, size and type of easements on the
property, and the proposed location of the above ground service facility,
including written dimensions of the distances between the above ground service
facility and the lot lines and structures on the lot.
      (2)   Plans and specifications for the installation of the above ground
service facility, including engineering plans, electrical plans, structural
elevations and plans for concrete pad construction, including any required
footings.
      (3)   Landscape plan, including details and elevations of required
screening, in accordance with division (F) of this section.
      (4)   Information concerning the size of the proposed above ground
service facility, its proximity to residential district boundaries, the nature
of uses on adjacent properties, surrounding topography, design elements that
would have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual impact.
   (D)   Location restrictions. The following restrictions on the location of
above ground service facilities shall apply:
      (1)   Location in yards. Above ground service facilities may be located
in required side or rear yards in all zoning districts; provided that they
shall be located a minimum of three feet from any side lot line and five feet
from any rear lot line.
   Above ground service facilities may be located in required front yards in
all zoning districts on any lot used for nonresidential purposes; provided that
a special use shall be required as provided in division (H) of this section,
and further provided that above ground service facilities shall be located a
minimum of five feet from any front lot line. Above ground service facilities
are prohibited in the front yard of any lot used exclusively for residential
purposes.
      (2)   Location related to adjacent uses. Above ground service facilities
located on a lot with a nonresidential use shall not be constructed in a
required yard that abuts a residential use. Above ground service facilities
located on a lot with a multiple-family residential use shall not be
constructed in a required yard that abuts a single-family residential use.
      (3)   Location on easements and stormwater facilities or spillways. Above
ground service facilities shall not be located on any easement without the
express written permission of all parties to whom the easement is granted, and
documentation of such consent shall be submitted to the Director of Community
and Economic Development with the application for a building permit. Above
ground service facilities shall not be located in stormwater detention
facilities or over spillways.
      (4)   Location in buildable area. Above ground service facilities shall
not be located in the buildable area between the principal structure and the
front yard line on a lot with a residential use. Above ground service
facilities shall not be located in the buildable area between the principal
structure and the front yard line on a lot with a nonresidential use, unless a
special use is granted in accordance with division (H) of this section, and the
above ground service facility is screened in accordance with division (F) of
this section.
      (5)   Location in relation to other above ground service facilities. No
above ground service facility shall be located within a radius of 250 feet of
any existing or approved above ground service facility. The Director of
Community and Economic Development may administratively waive this restriction
if it is determined, after consultation with an independent technical expert as
provided in division (I) of this section, that no other site or current
technology could be used to provide the intended services to the city and
requiring compliance with the separation requirement would create a gap in the
ability to provide the intended services to the city.
      (6)   Location as to bulk regulations. For purposes of determining
whether the installation of an above ground service facility complies with the
bulk regulations for the zoning district in which it is located, including but
not limited to yard, lot size and lot coverage requirements, the dimension of
the entire zoning lot shall control, even though the above ground service
facility may be located on leased property within such zoning lot.
   (E)   Other restrictions. The following additional restrictions shall apply
to above ground service facilities:
      (1)   Number of above ground service facilities. Only one above ground
service facility shall be located on any zoning lot.
      (2)   Maximum height and size of above ground service facilities. Above
ground service facilities shall be no more than six feet in height, and no more
than six feet in any one dimension, with a footprint no greater than 36 square
feet.

free of any peeling paint, rust and graffiti. When included as part of an
existing building or structure, such facilities shall be of a material or color
which matches the exterior of the building or structure and shall be located or
screened in an aesthetically acceptable manner so as not to be visible from the
adjacent properties or rights-of-way. The determination as to whether any such
facility meets this standard shall be made by the Director of Community and
Economic Development.
      (6)   Abandonment. In the event that the use of any above ground service
facility has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the above
ground service facility shall be deemed abandoned. Determination of the date of
abandonment shall be made by the Director of Community and Economic
Development, who shall have the right to request documentation from the service
entity regarding the use of the above ground service facility. Upon the
Director of Community and Economic Development’s determination and written
notification to the service entity of such abandonment, the service entity
shall either reactivate the use of the above ground service facility, transfer
the use of such above ground service facility to another service entity that
makes actual use of the facility, or dismantle and remove the above ground
service facility and notify the Director of Community and Economic Development
thereof in writing, within 90 days after such notice.

following the issuance of a report by the Planning and Zoning Commission or in
the absence of a report at its next regularly scheduled City Council meeting
held not less than three days following the expiration of the 45 days following
receipt of the permit application and initial permit fee. Subject to division
(K)(5) of this section, the City Council shall base its approval or disapproval
of the application solely upon the standards applicable to highway advertising

standards applicable to highway advertising signs set forth in this chapter.
      (5)   Denial of permit. The City Council shall deny the highway

or between January 1 and April 30;
         (b)   April 30 of the year following its issuance, if the permit is
issued on or between May 1 and December 31;
         (c)   Six months after the date of issuance if the work authorized by
the permit has not commenced; or
         (d)   If work has commenced and the work is discontinued for a period
of six months, six months after the date of discontinuance of work. No work
authorized by a permit that has expired may be performed until a new permit has
been secured.,
      (8)   Renewal. An unexpired and unrevoked highway advertising sign
special use permit, and if applicable, the multiple message sign supplemental
permit, may be renewed upon written application to the City Clerk made at least
30 days prior to the expiration date of the current highway advertising sign
special use permit and the payment of an annual permit renewal fee as provided
in §
110.05 of this code provided that the highway advertising sign continues to
meet the standards set forth in this chapter. The renewal fee will be due on
May 1 of each year. The application for renewal shall supply the current name,
address, telephone number and electronic mail address of the applicant, shall
set forth evidence that the permit issued by the Illinois Department of
Transportation for the highway advertising sign remains valid and any
information required by the initial application that has changed since the
issuance of the last permit. Within 30 days after receipt of the renewal
application and payment of the renewal fee, the City Clerk shall determine if
it is complete. If the renewal application is incomplete, the City Clerk shall
notify the applicant in writing of its deficiencies. If the renewal application
is complete, the permit issued by the Illinois Department of Transportation for
the highway advertising sign remains valid, the highway advertising sign, and
if applicable, the multiple message sign, continues to meet the standards set
forth in this chapter and the renewal fee has been paid, then the City Clerk
shall issue a renewal permit. If the City Clerk fails to issue a renewal permit
within 30 days following receipt of the renewal application and renewal fee,
the permit shall be deemed to have been issued.
      (9)   Revocation of permits. Whenever the Director of Community and
Economic Development determines that grounds exist for the revocation of a
permit or registration, the Director of Community and Economic Development
shall send written notice to the permit or registration holder, at the address
listed on the permit or registration holder’s most recent application or most
recent notification received by the city of a change of address, advising the
permit or registration holder of the basis of the proposed revocation, the
location, date and time of a hearing to revoke the permit or registration, and
affording the permit or registration holder the opportunity to appear and
respond to the basis for the revocation contained in the notice, a highway
advertising sign special use permit or registration and, if applicable, the
multiple message sign supplemental permit may be revoked for any of the
following actions or omissions by the applicant:
         (a)   Substantial departure from the approved permit application or
plans and specifications;
         (b)   Refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of the
Building Code, the Property Maintenance Code, Electrical Code or other
ordinance applicable to the highway advertising sign or this section;
         (c)   False statements or misrepresentations made in securing the

message sign supplemental permit; or
         (d)   Failure to pay the annual permit renewal fee; or
         (e)   The use of the highway advertising sign shall cease for a period
of 90 days. A permit mistakenly issued in violation of this section or any
other state law or ordinance may also be revoked. No highway advertising sign
special use permit or and, if applicable, a multiple message sign supplemental
permit shall be revoked except after a hearing by the Director of Community and
Economic Development conducted not sooner than seven days following the mailing
of notice to the permit or registration holder.
   (L)   Maintenance. All highway advertising signs shall be erected and
maintained in accordance with the city Building Code and Property Maintenance
Code and §
156.043 of this code. Any illuminated highway advertising sign or changeable
electronic variable message sign shall meet the requirements of the current
city Electrical Code. In addition, the highway advertising sign site must be
kept free of litter resulting from deterioration of the highway advertising
sign.
   (M)   Insurance. The permit holder shall obtain and thereafter keep in force
commercial general liability insurance coverage provided by an insurance
company authorized to transact business under the laws of the State of
Illinois. The insurance company providing coverage shall be rated in the Best’s
Key Rating Guide with a rating not lower than B+ provided the financial size
category is VII or larger or a company rated A- or better having a financial
size category of not less than VI. The commercial general liability insurance
coverage shall be written in the occurrence form and shall provide coverage
having an occurrence limit of $1,000,000 and a general aggregate liability
limit of $2,000,000. The insurance shall have an effective date prior to the
date the erection of the sign structure commences and shall remain in force
during the period until the sign structure is removed. Termination or refusal
to renew the required coverage shall not be made without 30 days’ prior written
notice to the city by the insurer, and the policy shall be endorsed so as to
remove any language restricting or limiting liability concerning this
obligation. In the event of an occurrence giving rise to a loss which affects
the interests of the city or the public, the permit holder shall promptly
furnish to the city full certified copies of the insurance policy and any
endorsements thereto.
   (N)   Bond. The permit holder shall furnish a bond secured by a surety
company acceptable to the city in the amount of $5,000 conditioned upon the
faithful observance of the provisions of this section. The bond shall be
executed by a surety that is licensed to transact business in Illinois named in

Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptance Reinsuring Companies” as published
in Circular 570 (amended) by the Audit Staff Bureau of Accounts, U.S. Treasury
Department. All bonds signed by an agent must be accompanied by a certified
copy of the authority to act. The date of the bond must not be prior to the
date of the application. If the bond is executed by an out-of-state agent, it
shall be counter-signed by a resident agent licensed in Illinois and evidence
of being so licensed shall be furnished. If the surety on the bond furnished by
the permit holder is declared bankrupt, or becomes insolvent, or its right to
do business is terminated in Illinois or it ceases to meet the requirements
herein, the permit holder shall within five days thereafter substitute another
bond and surety, both of which shall be acceptable to the city.
   (O)   Nonconforming signs. Any highway advertising sign already legally in
existence prior to the effective date of this section may be maintained for the
life of the sign. If the nonconforming sign or nonconforming sign structure is
destroyed or partially destroyed to the extent that any new permits are
required, or the sign owner wishes to secure any permit to replace the
nonconforming sign structure for any other reason, the sign shall be made to
conform to this section except as otherwise provided by state law. Periodic
maintenance and repair of a nonconforming sign, including changing the sign
copy or advertisements, is permitted, provided such activities are not intended
to extend the life of the sign or increase the extent of nonconformity.
   (P)   Removal of sign structures. The owner of any property upon which a
highway advertising sign special use permit has been issued shall remove the
sign structure and restore the property to substantially the same condition
that existed prior to the installation of the sign structure within 30 days
following the non-renewal or revocation of the highway advertising sign special
use permit. However, if the owner of the property is unable to secure the
appropriate government or utility approval or assistance to facilitate such
removal, this time shall be extended a reasonable amount of time to allow for
the removal of the sign structure. In the event that the owner of the property
shall fail to remove the sign structure within 30 days following the
termination of the highway advertising sign special use permit, the city may,
at its option, remove the sign structure; and the owner of the property shall
reimburse the city for all costs and expenses of the removal.

advertising sign and owner of record of the property upon which the highway
advertising sign is situated. The notice shall give the nature of the
violation, with reference to the applicable provisions of this section; actions
necessary to correct any deficiencies; whether immediate corrective action is
to be taken or whether 30 days are allowed to correct or remove the sign in
violation; and that the decision of the Director of Community and Economic
Development may be appealed to the City Council.
      (2)   Failure to comply. If no corrective action has been taken after
notice has been given, the Director of Community and Economic Development shall
initiate or cause the City Corporation Council to initiate any legal action or
proceedings necessary to enforce this section.
   (R)   Penalties; remedies.
      (1)   Any person, firm, corporation, or association placing or erecting
any outdoor advertising sign in violation of this section shall be punishable a
fine in the amount of $750 for each offense with each day that the violation
continues considered a separate violation.

appropriate remedies to insure compliance with these provisions.

interpretation, decision, denial of a highway advertising sign renewal special
use permit or receipt of a violation notice.

limitations imposed by the Director of Community and Economic Development shall
be suspended until the City Council renders a decision.

districts, as shown on the Zoning District Map, the following rules shall
apply:
   (A)   Where district boundary lines are depicted as following railroads,
highways, streets, alleys, or rights-of-way, they shall be interpreted as

boundary lines are depicted as following lot lines or section lines, such lines
shall be construed to be the district boundary lines.

indicated as a strip adjacent to and paralleling a street, highway or railroad,
the depth of such strips shall be in accordance with dimensions shown on maps
measured at right angles from the center line of a street, highway, or
railroad, and the length of frontage shall be in accordance with dimensions

the operating history, if any, and business practices of the applicant and any
other factors which the City Administrator deems necessary to promote the

of the Adult-Use Cannabis Dispensary. The City Administrator shall establish
conditions of approval for each onsite consumption permit, including, but not

that the distinctive odor generated inside the on-site cannabis consumption
area is not detected outside the on-site cannabis consumption area, outside of
the Adult-Use Cannabis Dispensary, anywhere on the adjacent property, from any
public right-of-way, on or about any exterior or interior common area walkways,
hallways, breezeways, foyers, lobby areas, or in any other area available for
common use by the public. Each odor control and mitigation plan shall be
certified by a qualified licensed professional engineer, and include the
following:
         (a)   Operational processes and maintenance plan, including activities
undertaken to ensure the odor mitigation system remains functional;
         (b)   Staff training procedures; and
         (c)   Engineering control, which may include carbon filtration or
other methods of air cleansing, and evidence that such controls are sufficient
to effectively mitigate odors from all odor sources.
         In addition, the odor control and mitigation plan shall be consistent
with accepted and best available industry-specific technologies designed to
effectively mitigate odors from all odor sources. Any failure to submit the
odor control and mitigation plan for an on-site cannabis consumption area in
compliance with this section will result in denial, revocation or suspension of
the on-site cannabis consumption permit.

(2) of this section, when required parking facilities are provided on land

or ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the
parking facilities are necessary. No such off-site parking facilities shall be
authorized and no occupancy permit shall be issued if the plans call for
parking other than on the same zoning lot unless the Planning and Zoning

the common ownership or right of possession of the zoning lot and the site of
the parking facilities are reasonably certain to continue and that the off-site
parking facilities will be maintained at all times during the life of the
proposed use or buildings. Annual proof shall be provided to the Director of
Community and Economic Development of continuing ownership or right of
possession. If for any reason parking facilities so established shall no longer

constituent use would be permitted, provided that the total number of spaces so
located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate requirements of
each use except as otherwise provided within division (A) of this section, or

requirements of § 502 of the Illinois Accessibility Code or its successor
provisions. Only in the case of an adjacent 90-degree accessible parking

parking scheme without hearing to utilize shared aisles provided no reduction
in the total number of parking spaces occurs.

zoning lot and use.
      (5)   Markings for required parking spaces shall be laid and restored as
often as necessary to clearly delineate each parking space, but such markings
shall not be required in single-family residential districts, except for
permitted nonresidential and special uses.
   (E)   Access. Each required off-street parking space shall either be located
on a driveway, or shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway, of such width

street or easement, in a manner which will least interfere with traffic
movement. Except for nonresidential uses in a residential district, no driveway
across public property shall exceed a width of 25 feet at the city's right-of-

residential district and all uses in a commercial district, no driveway across
public property shall exceed a width of 35 feet at the city's right-of-way

two sets of plans for the development and construction showing full compliance
with provisions of this section will be fully complied with.

(6" thickness, 4" compacted aggregate base course), or Portland cement concrete
unit pavers (bedding and compacted base material and thickness per
manufacturer's requirements). These are minimum standards and all pavement
areas shall be constructed to sustain the wheel loads of the anticipated
vehicle users. Parking spaces and access thereto constructed prior to November
27, 2007, may be rehabilitated without total reconstruction; provided that the
compacted base is left undisturbed and the thicknesses of the replacement
paving material (either bituminous concrete, Portland cement concrete, or
Portland cement concrete unit pavers) is equal to what is being removed. Areas
not surfaced shall be landscaped, and plants shall be maintained in a healthy,
growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance.

designating aisles, parking spaces, pedestrian walkways, and the like, and the
markings shall be designed and maintained so as to ensure their visual
effectiveness.
         (d)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be directed away from residential properties in such a way as not
to create a nuisance, and in no case shall such lighting exceed two foot
candles at any lot line.

to the Stormwater Administrator for approval of adequate drainage of
stormwater.
         (f)   Building permits. No parking lot shall be constructed unless and

Application for a permit shall be submitted to the Director of Community and
Economic Development in such form as may be determined by the Director of

plans for the development and construction of the parking lot demonstrating
full compliance with the provisions of this section.
   (G)   Location. Except for permitted valet parking or uses in the M-U Mixed
Use District, the location of off-street parking spaces in relation to the use
served shall be as prescribed hereinafter. All distances specified shall be
walking distances between such parking spaces and a main entrance to the use
served.

date of filing of the last required document or within 60 days from the date of
the filing of the application for final approval of the plat, whichever date is
later, unless the time is extended by agreement with the subdivider. Failure of
the City Council to act within such time shall be deemed a denial. After the

(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08; Am. Ord. 22-24, passed 8-23-22)
§ 159.08 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   Planning and Zoning Commission; review standards. In the review of
subdivision plats and plans for PUD's for recommendation, and in the
application of this chapter, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider
the following issues:
      (1)   The location of streets, lot sizes and locations, as well as the
reports and recommendations of the Administrator and City Engineer.
      (2)   Conformance to the provisions and conditions of the Comprehensive
Plan of the city. A recommendation for plat approval may be withheld if a
subdivision does not conform to the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   No recommendation for approval of any plat of subdivision shall be
forwarded to the City Council if such plat does not make adequate provision for
storm water management, as determined by the City Engineer.
      (4)   Due regard shall be given to the preservation of natural features
such as trees, for which preservation credits may be considered under the
city's zoning code; watercourses; and historical and similar features.
   (B)   Dedication of land for public use; general provisions.
      (1)   Whenever a preliminary plat or preliminary plan for a PUD includes
a proposed dedication of land for public use, and the City Council finds that
such land is not required or is not suitable for public use, the City Council
may either refuse to approve such dedication in the location shown, or require
that the configuration of the dedicated land be modified to an acceptable form.
      (2)   Upon approval of a final plat of subdivision or a final plan for a
PUD by the City Council, and the granting of all other required approvals of
such plat or plan, land shown on the plat or plan as dedicated to or reserved
for public use, including street dedications, shall be deemed accepted by the
city for the purpose(s) designated thereon.
      (3)   Dedication of land for park and recreation use shall be governed by
the provisions of the city's Comprehensive Plan and the subchapter entitled
"Land Dedication for Park, Open Space and Recreation Purposes" of this chapter.
   (C)   Vacation of a plat of subdivision. Any plat or any part of a plat may
be vacated by the owner of the premises at any time before the sale of any lot
therein, by a written instrument declaring the plat to be vacated, and a copy
of such plat shall be attached to such instrument. If there are public service
facilities in the highways, streets and other public ways, and in easements
shown on the plat, the instrument shall reserve to the city or public utility
owning such facilities, the property, rights-of-way and easements necessary for
continuing public service by means of those facilities, and for the
maintenance, renewal and reconstruction of such facilities. Such an instrument
shall be approved by the City Council prior to its recordation in the same
manner as plats of subdivision. The City Council may reject any such instrument
which abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its streets and other
public rights-of-way. Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or
proved, and recorded or filed, in the same manner as plats of subdivision. Once
recorded or filed, the instrument operates to destroy the force and effect of
the recording of the plat vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, and other public rights-of-way, and all dedications laid out or
described in such plat, and to render effective any reservation set forth in
the instrument as provided in this division. When lots have been sold, the plat
may be vacated in the manner herein provided by the owners of lots in such
subdivision joining in the execution of such writing.
   (D)   Approval of a lot split, lot reconfiguration or lot consolidation.
Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in the divisions above, a lot split,
lot reconfiguration or lot consolidation may be permitted upon review and
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The following procedure
shall be required:
      (1)   The owner or owners of any lot or lots may apply for a lot split,
lot reconfiguration or lot consolidation for said lot or lots without complying
with all of the regulations of this chapter, by submitting a petition therefor
to the Administrator substantially in the following form:

      (2)   Final disposition.
         (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the plat of
survey, the Administrator's review for zoning compliance and the City
Engineer's review for environmental impact, including stormwater management.
The Commission shall then make a recommendation to the City Council that it
grant or deny approval of the lot split, lot reconfiguration or lot
consolidation, or grant approval subject to specified modifications or
conditions, including the Commission's findings as to items 1 through 5 of the
petition as set forth in subdivision (1) of this division.

(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.09 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Streets. All dedicated streets abutting upon or within subdivided
properties or properties developed under an approved PUD shall be constructed,
by the subdivider or developer, at its own expense, in accordance with the
specifications established in the "City of Oakbrook Terrace Subdivision and
Public Improvement Standards".
      (1)   General considerations. Streets shall be designed and located in
relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions and
natural terrain features such as streams and existing tree growth, to public
convenience and safety, and in appropriate relation to the proposed uses of
land to be served by such streets.
      (2)   Arrangement.
         (a)   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated rights of way as established in
the city's Comprehensive Plan.
         (b)   All arterial and major collector streets shall be properly
related to special traffic generators, such as businesses, schools, churches,
and shopping centers; to population centers; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
         (c)   Minor collector and local streets shall be laid out to conform
as much as possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to
permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum
number of streets necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (d)   A rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not necessarily
be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets shall be encouraged where
they will result in more desirable layout.
         (e)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided or developed, unless prevented by topography or other
physical conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning
Commission, based on the recommendation of the City Engineer, such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout or most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
         (f)   In business subdivisions or PUD's, the streets shall be planned
in connection with the grouping of buildings and truck loading and maneuvering
areas, so as to minimize conflicts of movement between the various types of
traffic.
      (3)   Access to arterial or major collector streets. Where a subdivision
or PUD borders on or includes an existing or proposed arterial or major
collector street, the City Council may require that access to such streets be
limited by one of the following means:
         (a)   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the arterial or major
collector street and front onto a parallel minor collector or local street, so
that no access is provided from the arterial or major collector street, with
landscaped screening provided along the rear lot lines of such lots;
         (b)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops, which
enter from and are designed generally at right angles to the arterial or major
collector street; or
         (c)   A frontage street, separated from the arterial or major
collector street by a landscaped or grass strip, with suitable access points.
         (d)   The number of minor collector and local streets entering an
arterial or major collector street shall be kept to a minimum.
      (4)   Street intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall generally be designed to intersect approximately
at right angles, and no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point.
No intersection of two new streets shall be designed or constructed at an angle
of less than 75 degrees.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of an existing street. No street jogs with center line offsets of
less than 150 feet shall be permitted. Where streets intersect arterial or
major collector streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
      (5)   Private streets.
         (a)   The City Council may, in its discretion, approve the
construction, maintenance and use of private streets within subdivisions and
PUD's, and may allow access to lots therein by means of such private streets.
The following standards shall apply to the construction, maintenance and use of
private streets within the city:
            1.   All private streets shall conform to all design standards as
provided under this code for public streets.
            2.   All private streets shall feature street signs substantially
similar in size, lettering and placement as the street signs required for
public streets within the city.
         (b)   A performance guarantee shall be provided to the city by the
subdivider or developer for the completion of the private streets and
associated improvements, in the same manner as provided in this chapter for the
completion of construction of the public improvements in a subdivision or PUD.
         (c)   The subdivider or developer shall record a declaration of
covenants, conditions and restrictions with respect to the subdivision, in a
form acceptable to the city's corporation counsel. Such declaration shall
include the following:
            1.   The establishment of an owners' association, which shall have
the obligation to maintain the private streets; have the right and obligation
to impose assessments against the lots within the subdivision or PUD for the
purpose of maintaining the private streets; and have the right and obligation,
pursuant to ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, § 11-209.1, to file a written request to have
the city provide parking and traffic enforcement on the private streets.
            2.   A prohibition against any amendment to such declaration that
would affect the requirements under this division, without the written consent
of the city.
   (B)   Sidewalks, pedestrianways and bike paths.
      (1)   Except for the Elmhurst Countryside Subdivision, as defined herein,
sidewalks shall be constructed in all subdivisions and PUD's, by the subdivider
or developer, at its own expense, in locations and in accordance with the
specifications established in the "City of Oakbrook Terrace Subdivision and
Public Improvement Standards".
      (2)   Bike paths may be constructed in a subdivision or PUD only with the

shall be used if it would duplicate or be confused with the names of existing
streets, and all street names shall be subject to the approval of the City
Council.
   (F)   Water supply. All subdivisions and PUD's within the city shall have an
interconnected water distribution system supplying all lots with water from the
city's water system or some other public water system if the city's water
system is not reasonably available. A subdivision outside of the city's
corporate limits may be supplied with water from individual wells located on
each lot, provided that such water supplies are approved by the DuPage County

by the subdivider or developer, at its own expense, in accordance with the
specifications established in the "City of Oakbrook Terrace Subdivision and
Public Improvement Standards".
   (G)   Sanitary sewer system. All subdivisions and PUD's within the city

(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.10 GUARANTEES FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS; INSPECTION; ACCEPTANCE.
   (A)   Guarantee of completion and compliance. For all subdivisions and PUDs,
guarantees shall be provided to the city to assure that any public improvements
required by §
159.09 this chapter shall be completed in compliance with the requirements
thereof. Such guarantees shall be instruments of credit in the form provided
for in division (C) of this section.
   (B)   Submittal of engineer's cost estimate. A detailed estimate of the
costs for all public improvements required by §
159.09 this chapter shall be submitted to the Administrator for review and
approval by the City Engineer. The estimate shall include a line item

materials and labor. The approved engineer's cost estimate shall be used to
determine the amount of the required instrument of credit.
   (C)   Instruments o f credit.
      (1)   Submittal of instruments of credit. The subdivider or developer
shall submit to the Administrator a cash bond, an irrevocable letter of credit,
a surety bond or a letter of commitment equal to 110% of the amount of the bid
for the required public improvements. However, the city may not require a cash
bond, irrevocable letter of credit, surety bond, or letter of commitment issued
by a bank, savings and loan association, surety, or insurance company from a
subdivider or developer to guarantee completion of a project improvement when
the builder or developer has filed with the city clerk a current, irrevocable
letter of credit, surety bond, or letter of commitment issued by a bank,
savings and loan association, surety, or insurance company, deemed good and
sufficient by the municipality accepting such security, in an amount equal to
or greater than 110% of the amount of the bid on each project improvement. The
city shall (i) register the cash bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or surety
bond under the address of the project and the construction permit number and
(ii) give the subdivider or developer a receipt for the cash bond, irrevocable
letter of credit, or surety bond. The city shall establish and maintain a
separate account for all cash bonds received from subdividers and developers to
guarantee completion of a public improvements. Such instrument of credit shall
be subject to the approval of the city's Corporation Counsel and Engineer,
which approval shall be subject to the following conditions:
         (a)   For letters of credit and letters of commitment, the lending
institution shall be acceptable to the Administrator.
         (b)   For surety bonds, the surety or insurance company shall be
authorized by the Illinois Department of Insurance to sell and issue sureties
in the State of Illinois.
         (c)   The letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment shall
provide that it shall not be canceled without the prior written consent of the
Administrator and shall not require the consent of the subdivider or developer
prior to any draw by the Administrator.
         (d)   The letter of credit surety bond or letter of commitment shall
include a guarantee that, and the cash bond shall be held until, all required
public improvements shall be completed by the subdivider or developer not later
than 24 months from the date of the recording of the plat or the issuance of a
building permit, whichever occurs first.
      (2)   If at any time the letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment is due to expire within 45 days or less, and has not been renewed,
the Administrator may, upon a determination that any required public
improvements have not been satisfactorily completed by the subdivider or
developer call and draw on the letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment without notice to the subdivider or developer, and without being
required to take any further action of any nature whatsoever. Thereafter, the
Administrator may either hold all proceeds from the letter of credit, surety
bond or letter of commitment as security for the satisfactory completion of all
required public improvements or use the proceeds to complete all such
improvements and reimburse the city for any and all costs and expenses incurred
by the city to complete such improvements, including legal fees and
administrative costs.
      (3)   If at any time the Administrator determines that the funds
remaining in the cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment are not, or may not be, sufficient to pay in full the remaining
unpaid cost of required public improvements then, within ten days following a
demand by the Administrator, the subdivider or developer shall increase the
amount of the cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment
to an amount determined by the Administrator to be sufficient to pay such
unpaid costs. Failure to so increase the amount of the security shall be
grounds for the Administrator to draw the entire remaining balance of the cash
bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment.
      (4)   If at any time the Administrator determines that the lending
institution issuing the letter of credit or letter of commitment is no longer
acceptable to the city or is in danger of being unable to honor the letter of
credit or letter of commitment at any time during its tenn or the surety or
insurance company issuing the surety bond is no longer authorized by the
Illinois Department of Insurance to sell and issue sureties in the State of
Illinois, the Administrator shall have the right to demand that the subdivider
or developer provide a letter of credit or letter of commitment from a bank
satisfactory to the Administrator, or a surety bond issued by a surety or
insurance company authorized by the Illinois Department of Insurance to sell
and issue sureties in the State of Illinois or may draw on the letter of credit
or letter of commitment or declare a default under the bond in the
Administrator's discretion. Any replacement letter of credit, letter of
commitment or surety bond shall be deposited with the Administrator not later
than ten days following such demand. Upon such deposit, the Administrator shall
surrender the original letter of credit, letter of commitment or surety bond to
the developer.
      (5)   The Administrator may, from time to time, authorize the release of
some portion of the funds remaining in the cash bond, letter of credit, letter
of commitment or surety bond as required public improvements are satisfactorily
completed: provided, however, that no more than 75% of the funds remaining in
the cash bond, letter of credit, letter of commitment or surety bond may be
released by the city until such time as a public improvements have been fully
completed and accepted by the City Council.

refuses to satisfactorily complete all required public improvements within the
specified time periods, or in any way fails or refuses to meet fully its
obligations under this chapter, the Administrator shall have the sole authority
to draw on and retain all or any of the funds remaining in the cash bond,
letter of credit, letter of commitment or surety bond. Thereafter, the
Administrator shall have the further right to take any action deemed reasonable
and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or refusal. The
proceeds of the cash bond, letter of credit, letter of commitment or surety
bond shall be utilized to pay for all costs and expenses, including legal fees
and administrative expenses, resulting from or incurred as a result of the
subdivided or developer's failure or refusal to satisfactorily complete the
required public improvements and fully meet its obligations under this chapter.
If the funds remaining in the cash bond, letter of credit, letter of commitment
or surety bond are insufficient to cover all such costs and expenses and to
maintain an amount in the cash bond, letter of credit, letter of commitment or
surety bond, sufficient to guarantee any remaining improvements or obligations
during the entire time such cash bond, letter of credit, letter of commitment
or surety bond should have been maintained by the subdivider or developer, then
the subdivider or developer shall, upon demand of the Administrator,
immediately increase the balance remaining in the cash bond, letter of credit,
letter of commitment or surety bond and deposit such cash bond, letter of
credit, letter of commitment or surety bond, with the Administrator, or the
Administrator may initiate such remedies as are available to the city to
collect any additional costs.
      (7)   Extension of instrument of credit. The Administrator, upon written
proof of the subdivider's or developer's difficulty in satisfactorily
completing the required public improvements in a timely manner, shall have the
authority to grant one extension of the cash bond, letter of credit, surety
bond or letter of commitment, not to exceed six months. The City Council may,
upon written proof of such difficulty, grant additional extensions of the cash
bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment.
   (D)   Inspection of improvements.
      (1)   All materials and each part or detail of the required public
improvements shall be subject, at all times, to inspection by the city or its
authorized representatives, and the subdivider or developer shall be held
strictly to the true intent of the specifications for such improvements as to
quality of materials, workmanship and the diligent execution of the
improvements. The city's inspections may include, but are not limited to, mill,
plant or shop inspections, and any material provided shall be subject to such
inspections. The city shall be allowed access to all parts of the subdivision
or PUD, and shall be furnished with such information and assistance from the
subdivider or developer as may be required to make a complete and detailed
inspection.
      (2)   All required public improvements that have been rejected shall be
repaired or removed and replaced in an acceptable manner by the subdivider or
developer at its own expense. Upon any failure on the part of the subdivider or
developer to comply with any order of the city made under the provisions of
this chapter, the city shall, after giving written notice to the subdivider or
developer, have the authority to cause defective improvements to be repaired or
removed and replaced, and to draw on the letter of credit for the cost thereof
or otherwise charge such costs to the subdivider or developer.
   (E)   Final acceptance of public improvements. Upon satisfactory completion
of all required public improvements in the subdivision or PUD, the subdivider
or developer shall notify the Administrator and City Engineer, in writing, that
all such improvements have been satisfactorily completed and that final
inspection thereof is requested. The subdivider or developer shall also forward
to the Administrator two copies of as-built drawings showing all such
improvements. Final inspection shall be made by the City Engineer and the
subdivider or developer. When the final inspection shows that the required
public improvements have been completed in a satisfactory and workmanlike
manner, and substantially in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications, the City Engineer shall so report to the City Council or such
other governmental agency as may be applicable, in writing, and shall recommend
that the required public improvements be accepted by the city or such other
governmental agency. Upon the city's acceptance of improvements, the subdivider
or developer shall execute a bill of sale conveying ownership and title to the
required public improvements to the city, and the Mayor and City Clerk shall
execute such bill of sale as evidence of the city's acceptance of such public
improvements. Upon acceptance of improvements by any other governmental agency
as may be applicable, the subdivider or developer shall execute any
documentation required by such governmental agency to convey ownership and
title to the required public improvements. Any items found to be deficient
during the inspection shall be identified to the subdivider or developer, and
final acceptance shall be withheld pending correction of any deficiencies.
Within 60 days after the subdivider or developer notifies the city in writing
of the completion of the public improvements , the cash bond, letter of credit,
letter of commitment or surety bond required in this division shall be released
to the subdivider or developer, but only upon receipt of the guarantee required
in division (F) of this section. For these purposes of this section, COMPLETION
means that the city has determined that the public improvements for which the
cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment was required
is complete or a licensed engineer or licensed architect has certified to the
subdivider or developer and the city that the public improvements have been
completed to the applicable codes and ordinances. The city shall pay interest
to the subdivider or developer, beginning 60 days after the subdivider or
developer notifies the city in writing of the completion of the public
improvements, on any bond not refunded to the subdivider or developer, at the
rate of 1% per month.
   (F)   Guarantee after completion and acceptance of public improvements.
      (1)   In order to ensure the satisfactory condition and function,
operation and maintenance of the required public improvements after acceptance
by the City Council or such other governmental agency as may be applicable, the
subdivider or developer shall provide a cash bond, letter of credit, surety
bond or letter of commitment equal to 10% of the estimated cost of the required
public improvements. The cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment shall generally comply with the requirements of this section for the
initial cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of commitment, or in
lieu of providing a new cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment, the subdivider or developer may provide and the city may accept
retention of 10% of the cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond or letter of
commitment originally provided to guarantee construction of required public
improvements. All required public improvements must be guaranteed by the
developer or subdivider for a period of at least two years after final
acceptance by the city or such other governmental agency as may be applicable.
For public improvements not to be owned by the city or such other governmental
agency as may be applicable, such guarantee shall be for a period of at least
two years after approval of the record drawings. Any warranty that is still in
effect on materials accepted by the city or such other governmental agency as
may be applicable shall be submitted to the Administrator at the time of
acceptance.
      (2)   The full balance of funds in the cash bond, letter of credit,
surety bond or letter of commitment shall be released at the end of the 24-
month guarantee period, if no defects in materials (including dead landscape
materials), workmanship, or design have become apparent. If defects are found,
the balance of funds remaining in the cash bond, letter of credit, surety bond
or letter of commitment shall be released after any draw by the city to
reimburse itself for any costs expended by the city to correct defective
improvements upon the subdivider's or developer's failure to do so. An
inspection of the function and condition of the improvements shall be conducted
by the City Engineer in the twenty-second month of the guarantee period.
      (3)   Establishment of property owner's associations. In order to
guarantee the continued maintenance of public, semi-public and privately owned
common areas, stormwater management facilities, and other public or common
areas, an association of property owners or other comparable administrative
body shall be established. Such association shall be responsible for the
perpetual maintenance of all such areas. A declaration of restrictions and
covenants shall be prepared by the subdivider or developer to establish the
property owner's association and to require perpetual maintenance of such areas
and a means of funding such maintenance, and such declaration shall be subject
to the review and approval of the city's corporation counsel.

§ 159.11 OTHER DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   On corner lots, no obstruction in a yard, including trees and shrubs,
shall be higher than 18 inches above the street level if located in that
portion of the yard within 25 feet of the corner formed by the intersection of
any two street right-of-way lines; provided that, notwithstanding such height
restriction, existing vegetation shall be allowed to remain unless it creates a

maintained within an open channel, with landscaped banks, adequate to provide
the maximum potential volume of flow.
   (C)   Blocks.
      (1)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots
of appropriate depths. Exceptions may be permitted for blocks adjacent to a
municipal boundary, a zoning district boundary, or arterial or major collector

facilities as required in the city's zoning code for the use contemplated.
      (3)   If the City Council permits residential lots fronting on arterial
or major collector streets, such lots shall be platted with extra depth so that
the required building line is increased by an additional 20 feet.
      (4)   Lots in residential blocks that are improved with buildings used
for business purposes shall be platted with a building line at least equal to
the building line for the residential lots in that block, and shall comply with
all applicable zoning requirements.
      (5)   Every lot shall front on or abut a street.
      (6)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles or radial to

LAND DEDICATION FOR PARK, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PURPOSES
§ 159.20 DEDICATION OF LAND FOR PARK, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PURPOSES, OR
CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU THEREOF.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or a final plan
for a PUD for any residential use, regardless of the zoning classification of
the property to be developed, each subdivider or developer will be required to
dedicate land for park, open space and recreation purposes that will serve the
immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision or PUD, or to
make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of
both, at the option of the city, in accordance with the criteria set forth in
this subchapter.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.21 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING LAND DEDICATION FOR PARK, OPEN SPACE AND
RECREATION PURPOSES.
   (A)   Requirements and population ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed
development for any residential use, regardless of the zoning classification of
the property to be developed, shall bear directly upon the amount of land
required for dedication. The total requirement shall be 5.5 acres of land per
1,000 of ultimate population. The required 5.5 acres may be allocated by the
City Council, in its discretion, based upon the following criteria:
Types of Recreation Areas       Size Range              Minimum Acres per 1,000
                                                        People
(a)    Mini or vest pocket pa.20 acres               Not applicable
(b)    Playlot               .5 to 2.9 acres         .5
(c)    Neighborhood playgroun3 to 4.9 acres          1.5
(d)    Neighborhood park and 5 acres per elementary
school                          school to 6.9 acres per Not applicable
                                junior high school
(e)    Neighborhood park     7 to 14.9 acres         1.5
(f)    Playfield             15 to 40 acres or more  1.5
(g)    Regional community par40 to 100 acres or more 4.00
 
   (B)   Location. The most desirable location for land dedication for park,
open space and recreation purposes is a central location within the subdivision
or PUD that will serve the entire subdivision or PUD equally. In large
subdivisions or PUD's, such park, open space and recreation sites may be
located throughout the subdivision or PUD, and shall meet established standards
for the appropriate distances between park, open space and recreation areas as
set forth in Recreation Park and Open Space Standards and Guidelines.
Additional guidelines for consideration in locating park, open space and
recreation sites include, but are not limited to, the size of the subdivision
or PUD; the proximity of a proposed site to other parks, open spaces,
recreation areas, schools and municipal services; and the topography and shape
of the proposed site.
   (C)   Credit for private park, open space and recreation areas. As the
provision of private park, open space and recreation areas has the effect of
reducing the demand for public parks, open spaces and recreation areas,
consideration may be given to reducing the required land dedication or
contribution for park, open space and recreation purposes by the substitution
of private park, open space and recreation areas. The extent to which private
park, open space and recreation areas may be substituted shall be determined by
the City Council, based on the following standards:
      (1)   The extent to which the substituted private park, open space and
recreation sites substantially conform with the total park and recreation land
requirements for the general area as identified in the city's Comprehensive
Plan.
      (2)   Whether the subdivider or developer has provided guarantees, by the
execution of appropriate legal documents, to assure permanent and ongoing
maintenance of the private park, open space and recreation areas.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.22 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING A CASH CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION
FOR PARK, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PURPOSES.
   Where the subdivision or PUD is small and the resulting potential for park,
open space and recreation areas is, in the opinion of the city, too small to be
practical, or when the available land, in the opinion of the city, is
inappropriate for park, open space and recreational purposes, the city shall
require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of any
required land dedication. The cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
shall be paid to the city, which shall hold the contribution in trust for the
park district having jurisdiction over the subdivision or PUD. Such
contribution shall be held in trust by the city for the park district in which
the subdivision or PUD is located, solely for the acquisition and/or
improvement of land located entirely within the corporate limits of the city
for park, open space or recreation purposes to serve the immediate or future
needs of the residents of the subdivision or PUD, or for the improvement of
other existing park, open space and recreation areas located entirely within
the corporate limits of the city that already serve such needs. When the park
district provides the city with appropriate documentation, such as a signed
sales contract, a signed public improvement contract, or a signed park district
purchase order, to verify that a purchase of land or an improvement to an
existing park by the park district is in compliance with the use requirements
for the cash contribution made by any subdivider or developer pursuant to this
subchapter, the city shall release the funds to the park district as soon as
reasonably possible. The city shall have the right to request and receive
annual audit reports and any other information from the affected park districts
as the city may need from time to time to ensure the park districts' compliance
with use requirements for the cash contribution made by any subdivider or
developer pursuant to this subchapter. If any portion of a cash contribution in
lieu of land dedication for park, open space and recreation purposes is not
expended for the permitted purposes within ten years from the date of receipt,
the city or the park district holding the funds shall refund such contribution
to the owners of record of all lots in the subdivision or PUD for which such
contribution was made, except for land or lots already dedicated or improved
for park, open space and recreation purposes pursuant to the provisions of this
subchapter.
   (A)   Acquisition using cash in lieu of land dedication for park, open space
and recreation purposes.
      (1)   The term ACQUISITION as used in this subchapter shall mean the
acquiring of land located or to be located entirely within the corporate limits
of the city by purchase, condemnation or such other means as may be
appropriate.
      (2)   The acquired land shall be appropriate for the type of facility
defined as an "improvement" in division (B) of this section.
   (B)   Improvement using cash in lieu of park land donations.
      (1)   Where existing park, open space and recreation areas located
entirely within the corporate limits of the city will serve the needs of the
subdivision or PUD, the cash contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be
used for the following types of physical improvements in such existing areas:
         (a)   Play lots and playgrounds.
         (b)   Hard surface courts (tennis, basketball, tetherball).
         (c)   Pathways (walkways, jogging and cycle paths).
         (d)   Sport fields and athletic grounds (baseball, soccer, football).
         (e)   Picnic facilities (tables, grills, and the like).
         (f)   Open shelters and restroom facilities.
         (g)   Support facilities (i.e. parking, parking lots, drinking
fountains, security lighting, water service, sanitary sewer service, internal
roadways, electrical lines, lights and standards, sidewalks) for any of the
improvements authorized in this division (B).
         (h)   Other recreational grounds.
      (2)   Improvements shall also include the construction of buildings and
structures, additions to existing buildings and structures, or remodeling and
renovations to existing buildings and structures to better serve existing or
future needs of the residents of the subdivision or PUD.
      (3)   Improvements shall not include general maintenance or operations,
salaries of employees or officers, or payment of existing debt service for the
park district.
      (4)   If any improvement provided for herein shall require voter
referendum approval under existing statutory authority before such funds may be
lawfully expended, such approval shall be obtained prior to making,
constructing or installing such improvement.
   (C)   Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be
based on the sum of the fair market value of a vacant, unimproved and
unsubdivided acre of land in the city and the estimate of the city as to the
cost of improving such land with electrical utilities, water, sewer and
streets, including enclosed drainage and curbs and gutters, and all other
improvements required to comply with all requirements of any statute,
regulation or ordinance applicable to the development. All cash contribution
calculations shall be made by the city, and the park district shall refer all
developers to the city for such calculations. The fair market value of a vacant
unsubdivided acre of land for purposes of determining any cash contribution in
lieu of land shall be the greater of (i) the amount per acre paid by the
developer to purchase the land underlying the proposed development plus the
cost of improvement of the land which the city hereby declares to be $31,000;
or (ii) the fair market value of a vacant unsubdivided, unimproved acre of land
in and about the city, which the city has determined to be $125,000, and the
cost of improvements, which the city has declared to be $31,000, and such
figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider,
developer or the park district files a written objection thereto. In the event
of any such objection, the developer shall, at his cost and by a Member of
Appraisal Institute (M.A.I.), submit an appraisal showing the "fair market
value" of the land in the development or other evidence thereof, the final
determination of the fair market value of said unsubdivided land shall be made
by the City Council based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or
developer and from other relevant sources which may be submitted by the
subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the
City Council by the Oakbrook Terrace Park District, or others. The city, on its
own motion or at the request of the City Park District, may from time to time
amend this provision to provide for different fair market value for parcels
that are deemed by the City Park District and the city to be of greater or
lesser value than provided for herein.
   (D)   Cash contributions in lieu of land dedication shall be paid to the
city prior to the execution of the final plat by the requisite city officers.
   (E)   Criteria for requiring both a land dedication and a cash contribution
in lieu of land dedication. There may be situations when both a land dedication
and a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication are necessary. Such
situations may arise, if:
      (1)   It is determined by the city that the land to be dedicated for a
park, open space or recreation area within a subdivision or PUD does not
include the full acreage required, but is otherwise acceptable to the city, a
cash contribution shall be required for the difference between the required
acreage and the acreage proposed for the land dedication.
      (2)   It is determined by the city that a major portion of a park, open
space or recreation area has already been acquired and will serve the
subdivision or PUD, and that only a small portion of land is needed from the
contributing subdivision or PUD to complete the required park, open space or
recreation area, the dedication of such remaining portions shall be required,
and the subdivider or developer shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of
dedication for the difference between the land dedicated and the land required
to be dedicated for such subdivision or PUD.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.23 DENSITY FORMULA.
   The following table of population density is generally indicative of current
and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall
be used in calculating the required land dedication in acres of land or the
cash contribution in lieu thereof, unless a written objection is filed thereto
by the subdivider or developer as provided in division (B) of this section:
   (A)   Objections to density formula. In the event a subdivider or developer
files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Population Per Dwelling
Unit established in this section and submits, at its own expense, other
demographic studies or information showing the estimated additional population
to be generated from the subdivision or PUD, a final determination of the
density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the City
Council based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or
developer to the city, or upon such information as may otherwise be available
to the City Council. It is recognized that population density, age distribution
and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the
dedication of land, or the payment of a cash contribution in lieu thereof, as
stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
   (B)   Presumed density formula. In the event the relevant data on file with
the city, including any ordinances granting approval of a subdivision or PUD,
establishes a density level other than the density established in the Table of
Estimated Population Per Dwelling Unit established in this section, then such
density shall be used to determine a cash contribution in lieu of land
dedication; provided that the subdivider or developer shall be limited to the
final density level established by the City Council for its actual construction
of the subdivision or PUD.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.24 TOPOGRAPHY AND GRADING.
   The slope, topography, grading, soil quality and drainage of the land
dedicated for park, open space and recreation purposes, as well as its
surroundings, shall be suitable for its intended purposes, and no unreasonable
danger shall be created thereby.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.25 IMPROVED SITES.
   Public improvements shall be accessible to provide service to any land
dedicated for park, open space and recreation purposes, as appropriate for the
location of such land.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.26 TITLE TO DEDICATED LAND FOR PARK, OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PURPOSES.
   All land to be dedicated for park, open space and recreation purposes shall
be conveyed to the city either by warranty or trustee's deed. The subdivider or
developer shall be responsible for conveying good, merchantable title to such
land, and shall be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date
of conveyance. In the discretion of the city, a commitment for title insurance
issued by a company authorized to do business in Illinois may be required as
evidence of clear title. Conveyance shall occur only after or simultaneously
with the passage of an ordinance by the park district in which the subdivision
or PUD is located, which ordinance shall provide that the land is accepted by
the park district or city for park, open space and recreation purposes.
(Ord. 08-19, passed 9-9-08)
§ 159.27 INDEMNIFICATION.
   Except as otherwise provided below, any affected park district shall, as a
condition of receiving the donations hereunder, agree to indemnify and hold
harmless the city, its officers, employees and agents, from any loss, claim or
damages of any kind incurred by the city as a result, either directly or
indirectly, of the passage of this subchapter, or the administration or
enforcement thereof. If the city is sued by any subdivider or developer as a
result, directly or indirectly, of the passage of this subchapter, the city
may, at its option, undertake the defense thereof, but all costs and expenses
of such defense, including attorneys' fees, shall be immediately reimbursed by
the affected park district. The city may withhold delivery of any cash
contribution to a park district pending compliance with these indemnity
provisions, except as follows:
   (A)   If the city receives a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication
and fails to convey such contribution to the affected park district or expends
such contribution for its own purposes, and the affected park district files a
suit, the city shall defend against such suit and pay for all its own costs and
expenses related to such suit, including attorney's fees.
   (B)   If a park district improperly uses a cash contribution, or fails to
timely use a cash contribution and does not return such contribution as
required in §
159.22 of this chapter, the city may sue the affected park district and shall
be entitled to recover as part of the judgment in, or any settlement of such
suit, all of the costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the
city.
   (C)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, the indemnification provisions
established in this section shall be an implied condition of any
intergovernmental agreement entered between the city and a park district with
respect to cash contributions for park, open space and recreation purposes
pursuant to this subchapter.
