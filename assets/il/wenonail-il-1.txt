likely cause damage, injury, losses, hardship or suffering to the community or
its residents, which can be construed broadly to include disease epidemics and
other public health emergencies, is imminent or has occurred; and

emergency in order to supplement local resources in preventing loss of life or
injury, alleviating damages, loss, hardship or suffering or to necessitate
measures to be taken, including the identification of any applicable
procedures, rules or regulations that will be waived or suspended, during the
emergency.
   B.   The exercise of these powers shall be based upon a statement, signed
under oath by the Mayor, finding that the standards herein which form the basis

such a finding and declaring that a state of emergency exists.
   C.   This written declaration shall be filed with the City Clerk as soon as
practicable.

emergency; and
      2.   The Mayor to exercise, by executive order, the authority to let
contracts to the extent necessary to resolve such emergency upon declaration,
without public advertisement.
   E.   Any state of emergency declared pursuant to this authority shall expire
no later than the adjournment of the first regular meeting of the Corporate
Authorities after the state of emergency has been declared in accordance with
section 11-1-6 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/
11-1-6); however, if the state of emergency has not been resolved as of
commencement of the first regular meeting of the Corporate Authorities after
the state of emergency has been declared, the authorizations set forth above in
this section shall remain in full force and effect without further action by
the Mayor or Corporate Authorities until such state of emergency has been
resolved as declared in writing by the Mayor or until the authorizations are
withdrawn by passage of an ordinance by an affirmative majority vote the
Corporate Authorities at a public meeting.
   F.   A declaration of emergency pursuant to this authority may not suspend
in any way the rights of residents of the City under the Illinois Constitution
or the United States Constitution. (Ord. 03162020, 3-16-2020)

amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based upon
any difference between such billings, and the taxable gross receipts. (Ord.
070698A, 7-6-1998)
2-6-6: CREDIT OR OVERPAYMENT:
If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under

an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due, or to
become due, under this chapter from the taxpayer who made the erroneous
payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years
prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited.
No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter
shall be commenced more than three (3) years after the due date of such amount.

the mayor's deputy or representative, has procured such facts and information
upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and
payable to any operator or owner who has failed or refused to collect the same
and to make such report and remittance, the mayor, or any person certified as
the mayor's deputy or representative, shall proceed to determine and assess
against such operator or owner the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter.

mayor's deputy or representative, shall give a notice of the amount so assessed
by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the operator or owner so assessed at his last known
address.

such notice make application in writing to the mayor for a hearing on the
amount assessed. If application by the operator or owner for a hearing is not
made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the mayor shall become final and conclusive and immediately due
and payable.
If such application is made, the mayor shall give not less than five (5) days'
written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator or owner to show
cause at a hearing at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount
specified there should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator or owner may appear and offer evidence why such
specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such
hearing, the mayor shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the operator or owner in the manner
prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest
and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen

respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the mayor by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen
(15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The mayor
shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall
give notice in writing to such operator or owner at his last known address. The
findings of the mayor shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon
the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing.

stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is

and remitting the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or
illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed
by the city clerk that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not

in the mobile telecommunications sourcing conformity act. For air to ground
systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's
primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number,
authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.

on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other

intercompany facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent
provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end to end
telecommunications service shall be nontaxable as sales for resale. Prepaid
telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications"
subject to the tax imposed under this chapter. For purposes of this section,

2-27 of the retailers' occupations tax act. (Ord. 090313, 9-13-2013)

the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act
or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer,
upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that
event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or
authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due
and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit
against any other municipal tax.
   B.   The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in
the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six
percent (6%) of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at
retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multistate or multi-municipal
taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this
subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in
another state or municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a
credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the

to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the constitution and
statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the

2-8-3: COLLECTION OF TAX BY RETAILERS:
   A.   The tax authorized by this chapter shall be collected from the taxpayer
by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be
remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected
pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such
retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt
owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall
constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid,
is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale
at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the
taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the
manner provided by the department.

collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross
charge for telecommunications. (Ord. 090302, 9-9-2002)

by the department pursuant to the Illinois simplified municipal
telecommunications tax act (public act 92-526, section 5-50) and any
accompanying rules and regulations created by the department to implement the
act. (Ord. 090302, 9-9-2002)
2-8-5: RESELLERS:
   A.   If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be
a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the
department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will
show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by
this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional
information as the department may reasonably require.
   B.   Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale
number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The
department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation,
or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications tax free when such
actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the
person's having discontinued the making of resales.
   C.   Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax
free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active
resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in
connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is
nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 090302, 9-9-2002)

order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from to the extent and
in the manner that the board may decide to be fitting and proper in the
premises, and to that end the board shall also have all the powers of the
office from whom the appeal is taken.
   B.   Variances: When a property owner shows that a strict application of the
terms of this title relating to the use, construction, or alteration of
buildings or structures or the use of land imposes upon him practical
difficulties or particular hardship, then the board may make such variations of
the strict application of the terms of this title as are in harmony with its
general purpose and intent when the board is satisfied under the evidence heard
before it that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable
hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the
comprehensive plan by this title created and set forth in the following
instances:
      1.   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot in single ownership as shown of record.
      2.   To permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been destroyed or partially destroyed by fire or act of God where the board
shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use, and in no case shall such a permit be issued if its primary
function is to continue a monopoly.
      3.   To permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises
in any location for a public service company for public utility purposes which
the board deems necessary for public convenience and public service
corporation's welfare. Electric distribution centers, and gas regulating
centers of a public utility company may be located in any I industrial
district, but such facilities may be located in any other districts only after
obtaining permission provided for in this section.
      4.   To make a variance where, by reason of an exceptional situation,
surroundings, or a condition of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property of
record, or by reason of exceptional topographical conditions, the strict
application of any provisions of this title would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties or particular hardship upon the owner of
such property and amount to a practical confiscation of property as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner, providing such relief
would be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without
substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive
plan as established by the regulations and provisions contracted in this title.
      5.   To interpret the provisions of this title where the street layout
actually on ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map fixing the
several districts, which map is made a part of this title.
In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to this title the board
shall, before making any variations from this title in a specific case, first
determine that the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of
light and air to adjacent property, or unreasonably increase the congestion in
public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety,
or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety,
comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the municipality. The
concurring vote of three (3) members of the board shall be necessary to reverse
any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building inspector or
to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is authorized by
this title to render decision, or to effect any variance.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the board the
power or authority to alter or change this title, such power and authority
being reserved to the city council.
   C.   Appeals; Hearings: An appeal may be taken to the board of appeals by
any person or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality
affected by a decision of the building inspector. Such appeal shall be taken
within such time as shall be prescribed by the board of appeals by general
rule, by filing with the building inspector and with the board of appeals a
notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof. The building inspector shall
forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the building inspector certifies to the board of appeals after the
notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court
of record on application, on notice to the building inspector and on due cause
shown.
The board shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the
appeal and give due notice thereof to the parties and shall render a decision
on the appeal without unreasonable delay. Any person may appear and testify at
the hearing, either in person or by duly authorized agent or attorney. (Ord.

   D.   Hearings; Notice: The board shall make no recommendation except in a
specific case and after a public hearing conducted by the board. A notice of
the time and place of such public hearing shall be published in a paper of
general circulation in the municipality at least once, not more than thirty
(30) or less than fifteen (15) days previous to the hearing. Such notice shall
contain the particular address or location of the property for which the
variation or other ruling by the board is sought as well as a brief description
of the nature of the appeal, and of what the proposed variance consists.

is unsafe or insecure, or is a menace to the public, he shall give written
notice to the person to whom the sign permit has been issued. If he fails to
remove or alter the sign so as to comply with the standards herein set forth
within ten (10) days after such notice, such sign may be removed or altered to
comply, by the zoning administrator, at the expense of the sign permit issues
or owner of the property upon which it is located. The zoning administrator may
cause any sign which is an immediate peril to persons or property to be removed
summarily and without notice. The zoning administrator shall be responsible for
the inspection of the condition of signs and to investigate complaints issued
regarding signs.

         e.   Within thirty (30) days after an approved permit to collocate a
small wireless facility on a Municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant
shall enter into a Master Pole Attachment Agreement, provided by the City for
the initial collocation on a Municipal utility pole by the applicant. For
subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a
Municipal utility pole, the City and the applicant shall enter into a License
Supplement of the Master Pole Attachment Agreement.
      3.   Completeness Of Application: Within thirty (30) days after receiving
an application, the City shall determine whether the application is complete
and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the City must
specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed
complete if the City fails to provide notification to the applicant within
thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees specifically
enumerated in the City's permit application form are submitted by the applicant
to the City.
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the City sends the notice of
incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information.
      4.   Tolling: The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         a.   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the City;
or
         b.   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.
      5.   Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate small
wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure.
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the City may
remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat
separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete
information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment
or that are denied. The City may issue separate permits for each collocation
that is approved in a consolidated application.
      6.   Duration Of Permits: The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
duration unless the City makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or
the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable City codes
or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this chapter.
If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits
shall be subject to the applicable City Code provisions or regulations in
effect at the time of renewal.
      7.   Means Of Submitting Applications: Applicants shall submit
applications, supporting information and notices to the City by personal
delivery at the City's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked
on the date due or by any other commonly used commercial delivery services.
   C.   Collocation Requirements And Conditions:
      1.   Public Safety Space Reservation: The City may reserve space on
Municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the City's electric
utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the
collocation of a small wireless facility unless the City reasonably determines
that the Municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses.
      2.   Installation And Maintenance: The wireless provider shall install,
maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and
good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this
chapter. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or
contractors that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities
are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry
and governmental standards and regulations.
      3.   No Interference With Public Safety Communication Frequencies: The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications.
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and
frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety
agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with
industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable
interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a
public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless
provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety
agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the
interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution
procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR
90.675.
The City may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such
interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of
Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the
interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      4.   Location: The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless
facilities on City utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may
be located in the communications space on the City utility pole and on the top
of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies
with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space",
"communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
      5.   Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable
codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      6.   Design Standards: The wireless provider shall comply with written
design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or
reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth
in a City ordinance, written policy adopted by the City, a comprehensive plan
or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-
way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district.
      7.   Alternate Placements: Except as provided in this collocation
requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required
to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or
category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems
on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the
collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole,
the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an
existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred
feet (100') of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it
has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and
conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical
limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant.
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the City, the applicant
shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical
limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the
criteria in this paragraph.
      8.   Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility
shall be no more than ten feet (10') above the utility pole or wireless support
structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated.
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small
wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of:
         a.   Ten feet (10') in height above the tallest existing utility pole,
other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place
on the date the application is submitted to the City, that is located within
three hundred feet (300') of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless
support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the
jurisdictional boundary of the City, provided the City may designate which
intersecting right-of-way within three hundred feet (300') of the proposed
utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation
for such facility; or
         b.   Forty five feet (45') above ground level.
      9.   Height Exceptions Or Variances: If an applicant proposes a height
for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on
which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant
shall apply for a conditional use permit in conformance with procedures, terms
and conditions set forth in chapter 8 of this title.
      10.   Contractual Design Requirements: The wireless provider shall comply
with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the City and a private
property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to
utility poles and ground- mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
      11.   Ground-Mounted Equipment Spacing: The wireless provider shall
comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances
concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way
if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses
wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit
granting of such exceptions or variances.
      12.   Undergrounding Regulations: The wireless provider shall comply with
local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a
waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new
utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the
replacement of utility poles.
      13.   Collocation Completion Deadline: Collocation for which a permit is
granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance
of the permit, unless the City and the wireless provider agree to extend this
period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a Municipal utility pole or
by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided
the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the
additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty
(360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void
unless the City grants an extension in writing to the applicant.
   D.   Application Fees: Application fees are imposed as follows:
      1.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of six hundred fifty dollars
($650.00) for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on
an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and three hundred fifty
dollars ($350.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated
application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing
utility poles or wireless support structures.
      2.   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      3.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      4.   The City shall not require an application, approval or permit, or
require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         a.   Routine maintenance;
         b.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the City at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with subsection B1d of this section; or
         c.   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or
replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung
between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable Safety Codes.
      5.   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the City to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   E.   Exceptions To Applicability: Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      1.   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by
the City or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-
of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without
the consent of the property owner;
      2.   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      3.   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement: 1) to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or 2) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this chapter.
   F.   Pre-Existing Agreements: Existing agreements between the City and
wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities
in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
City utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the City's utility poles pursuant
to applications submitted to the City before June 1, 2018, subject to
applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter.
A wireless provider that has an existing agreement with the City on the
effective date of the Act may accept the rates, fees and terms that the City
makes available under this chapter for the collocation of small wireless
facilities or the installation of new utility poles for the collocation of
small wireless facilities that are the subject of an application submitted two
(2) or more years after the effective date of the Act by notifying the City
that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing agreement
remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small
wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the City's utility
poles pursuant to applications submitted to the City before the wireless
provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph.
   G.   Annual Recurring Rate: A wireless provider shall pay to the City an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a City utility
pole located in a right-of-way that equals: 1) two hundred dollars ($200.00)
per year or 2) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless
provider's use of space on the City utility pole.
If the City has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the
fee shall be two hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the
first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   H.   Abandonment: A small wireless facility that is not operated for a
continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The
owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety
(90) days after receipt of written notice from the City notifying the wireless
provider of the abandonment.
The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, by the City to the owner at the last known address of the wireless
provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days
of such notice, the City may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for Municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the City if it sells or
transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the City. Such
notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless
provider. (Ord. 071618A, 7-16-2018)
3-13-4: DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
The Circuit Court of Marshall County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act. Pending resolution of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small
wireless facilities on Municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the
City shall allow the collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual
rates of no more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per Municipal
utility pole, with rates to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 071618A, 7-16-2018)
3-13-5: INDEMNIFICATION:
A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the City harmless against any and
all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or
arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the City
improvements or right-of- way associated with such improvements by the wireless
provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the rights and
privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless provider has no
obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any liabilities and losses as
may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the City or its employees or
agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any claims that they may have
against the City with respect to consequential, incidental, or special damages,
however caused, based on the theory of liability. (Ord. 071618A, 7-16-2018)
3-13-6: INSURANCE:
The wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost and
expense, the following insurance:
   A.   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
   B.   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
   C.   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its activities
on the City's improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum protection limits
consistent with its requirements of other users of City improvements or rights-
of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and property damage.
The wireless provider shall include the City as an additional insured on the
commercial general liability policy and provide certification and documentation
of inclusion of the City in a commercial general liability policy prior to the
collocation of any wireless facility.
A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage
and limit requirement required by the City. A wireless provider that self-
insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to comply with
the requirement for the name of additional insureds under this section. A
wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the City evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self- insure the insurance
coverage limits required by the City. (Ord. 071618A, 7-16-2018)

REGULATIONS FOR THE CITY OF WENONA, ILLINOIS. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)
4-1-2: INTENT AND PURPOSE:
This title is adopted for the following purposes:
   A.   To ensure sound, harmonious subdivision development and community
growth which will become a permanent community asset by establishing minimum
standards for subdivision design and construction.
   B.   To assure the development of land for the highest possible use with all
the necessary protection against deterioration and obsolescence which would
adversely affect the living environment or tax base.
   C.   To provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working
relationship between the city of Wenona and the developer and to safeguard the
interests of the homeowner, the subdivider, the investor, and the city of
Wenona.
   D.   To control the scattered and premature platting of lots beyond the
effective operating range of existing public utilities and improvements.
   E.   To cause the cost of design and installation of improvements in new,
platted subdivisions to be borne by the persons purchasing the lots rather than
by any direct or indirect burden upon existing property owners beyond the
limits of the subdivision who have already paid for the improvements servicing
their property.
   F.   To bring about compact development of both homes and public
improvements without delay often experienced through future use of special
assessment methods.
   G.   To coordinate new subdivision design with the design of the city of
Wenona as a whole to allow for the proper capacity of all types of improvements
on the basis of an orderly sequence of subdivisions as a part of neighborhoods
and neighborhoods as a part of the community.
   H.   To secure the rights of the public with respect to public lands and
waters.
   I.   To improve land records by establishing standards for surveys and
plats. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)
4-1-3: GEOGRAPHIC JURISDICTION:
Any owner of land which is within the corporate limits of the city of Wenona or
within one and one-half (11/2) miles of such corporate limits on unincorporated
land, wishing to divide the same into lots or to resubdivide for the purpose of
sale or assessment, or both, or wishing to dedicate streets, alleys, or other
lands for public use, shall follow the procedures and requirements of this
title. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)
4-1-4: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Wherever any subdivision of land shall hereinafter be laid out, the
subdivider thereof or his agent shall submit a preliminary and a final
subdivision plat to the planning commission. Said plats and plans of proposed
improvements, and all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in
full compliance with these regulations.
   B.   Until plats and plans for the subdivision are approved, properly
endorsed and recorded:
      1.   No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any
improvements made to natural land;
      2.   No lot, tract, or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be
offered for sale nor shall any sale or option be made or given;
      3.   No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water
drainage, sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electric or lighting,
grading, paving, or surfacing of streets, shall hereafter be made by any public
service corporation at the request of such owner or owners or his or their
agent.
   C.   All lands offered to the city of Wenona for use as streets, alleys,
schools, parks, and other public uses shall be referred to the planning
commission for review and recommendation before being accepted by the Wenona
city council or by any other governing authority of the city of Wenona.
   D.   No plat will be approved for a subdivision which is subject to periodic
flooding or which contains poor drainage facilities and which would make
adequate drainage of the lots and streets impossible. However, if the
subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the city
of Wenona engineer, make the area safe for residential occupancy, and provide
adequate lot and street drainage, the preliminary plat of the subdivision may
be approved.
   E.   In all subdivisions due regard shall be given to the preservation of
historical sites and natural features such as large trees, watercourses, and
scenic views.
   F.   In the case of tentative plats for parts of tracts, where it appears
necessary to the planning commission for the satisfactory overall development
of an area, an owner may be required to prepare at least a street plan of his
entire tract based upon proper topographic surveys for approval of any portion
of such plan.
   G.   Whenever an area is subdivided into lots which may at a later date be
resubdivided, consideration shall be given to the street and lot arrangement of
the original subdivision so additional minor streets can be located which will
permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots.
   H.   The following shall be exempt from the provisions of this title:
      1.   The division of lots or blocks of less than one acre, in any
recorded subdivision, which does not involve any new streets or easements of
access.
      2.   The conveyance of parcels of land or interest therein for use of
right of way for railroads or other public utility facilities which does not
involve any new streets or easements of access.
      3.   The conveyance of land owned by a railroad or other public utility
which does not involve any new streets or easements of access.
      4.   The conveyance of land for highway or other public purposes or
grants of conveyances relating to the dedication of land for public use or
instruments relating to the vacation of land impressed with a public use.
      5.   The conveyance made to correct descriptions in prior conveyances.
      6.   The division of lots of record existing as of 1994, into no more
than two (2) parts and not involving any new streets or easements of access,
provided that the two (2) parts meet the requirements of the applicable zoning
ordinance and all other ordinances of the city of Wenona.
      7.   The division or subdivision of land into parcels or tracts of two
(2) acres or more in size which does not involve any new streets or easements
of access. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)
4-1-5: INTERPRETATION:
   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title
shall be held to be the minimum requirements.
   B.   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this title upon the
use of land are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by any other provision of this title or of any other law,
ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation, of any kind, the regulations which
are most restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements, shall
govern.
   C.   This title is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any
other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this title are
more restrictive or impose higher standards or requirements than such
easements, covenants, or other private agreements, then the requirements of
this title shall govern.
   D.   If an article, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this title is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions thereof. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)

with improvement plans and other supplementary material as specified in chapter
4 of this title.
   B.   Four (4) copies of the preliminary plat and supplemental material
specified shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission with
written application for conditional approval.
   C.   At the time of filing for conditional approval of the preliminary plat,
the application shall be accompanied by a certified check or money order,
payable to the city of Wenona, to cover the cost of checking and verifying the
proposed plat, based upon the rate of two dollars ($2.00) per lot or twenty
dollars ($20.00), whichever sum shall be greater, and not refundable.
Upon the acceptance of the application by the planning commission, the planning
commission secretary shall surrender the check or money order to the city of
Wenona treasurer for deposit in the general fund.
   D.   Following review of the preliminary plat and other material submitted
for conformity thereof to these regulations and negotiations with the
subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of improvements
to be made by him, the planning commission shall, within thirty (30) days, act
thereon as submitted or modified, and, if approved, the planning commission
shall express its approval as a conditional approval and shall state the
conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its
disapproval and its reasons therefor.
The action of the planning commission shall be noted on three (3) copies of the
preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy forwarded with a report to
the Wenona city council and the other retained by the planning commission.
   E.   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of
approval to the layout submitted in the preliminary plat as a guide to the
preparation of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the
planning commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of
these regulations and the conditions of the conditional approval, if any. (Ord.
070102C, 7-1-2002)

      3.   Detailed material and construction specifications concerning the
work to be performed, including general conditions of the contract acceptable
by the city of Wenona.
   C.   Upon the receipt of these final plans, the planning commission shall
refer same to the city of Wenona engineer for his comments and corrections. The
city of Wenona engineer shall review these plans for compliance with the
requirements of the city of Wenona, and shall return them together with his
recommendations to the planning commission. The city of Wenona engineer may, at
his discretion, confer with the engineer for the developer concerning
correction to the final plans prior to his final approval. All final plans
shall be submitted on twenty four inch by thirty six inch (24" x 36") cloth or
paper and shall bear the signature and seal of the Illinois registered
professional engineer under whose directions they were prepared.
   D.   Seven (7) copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for
approval shall be prepared as specified in chapter 4 of this title, and shall
be submitted to the planning commission within twelve (12) months after
approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise, preliminary plat approval shall
become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by
the planning commission.
   E.   Within thirty (30) days after application for approval of the final
plat, if the planning commission approves, it shall affix its seal upon the
plat together with the certifying signature of its chairman and secretary. If
the planning commission disapproves, it shall set forth its reasons in its own
records and provide the applicant with a copy.
   F.   1. After approval of the final plat by the planning commission and the
fulfillment of the requirements of these regulations, one tracing of the final
plat of the subdivision, drawn in ink on tracing cloth or other permanent
plastic base, shall be submitted to the Wenona city council for approval.
      2.   Action must be taken by the Wenona city council within sixty (60)
days after the final plat has been submitted to the council for approval.
      3.   Upon approval of the Wenona city council, the developer shall record
the plat with the county recorder or registrar of titles within four (4)
months. If not recorded within this time, the approval shall be null and void.
Immediately after recording, the original or a duly certified copy of the
recorded plat shall be filed with the Wenona city clerk. The developer shall
furnish the Wenona city clerk with three (3) additional copies to be
distributed as follows: one copy each to the city of Wenona engineer, city of

topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.
   B.   The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for
the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in
surrounding areas or meet a particular situation where topographical drainage
or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets
impracticable.
   C.   Local residential streets shall be so laid out that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
   D.   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
highway or interstate highway, the planning commission may require marginal
access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess
reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys,
or such other treatments as may be necessary for adequate protection of
residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   E.   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way or
limited access highway right of way, the planning commission may require a
street approximately parallel to and on each side of the intervening land, as
for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial
purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined also with
due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade
separations.
   F.   All street intersections should encourage safe traffic flow, and street
jogs with center offsets of less than one hundred twenty five feet (125') shall
not be approved.

right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty
degrees (60°).
   H.   Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with other requirements
of these regulations, and where the city of Wenona engineer finds it will be
practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining
property is subdivided. Wherever a half or partial street is adjacent to a
tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within
such tract.
   I.   Dead end streets, designed to be so permanently (cul-de-sac), shall not
be longer than seven hundred feet (700') and shall be provided at the closed
end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least one
hundred feet (100'). Where an existing street shall be continued in the street
pattern of the proposed subdivision, a turnaround shall be provided in the
proposed subdivision.
   J.   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of
the planning commission.
   K.   Street improvements shall conform to the following standards:
      1.   The full width of the right of way shall be graded to the required
section.
      2.   All unsuitable subbase material shall be removed and shall be

not exceed six percent (6%) on primary and secondary streets and the
percentages required in the table, "Minimum Standards For Street Design", in
section
4-6-4 of this title on minor streets and cul-de-sac streets.
      4.   Vertical curves shall be used whenever a change in centerline
gradient occurs, except where the algebraic difference in gradients is one
percent (1%) or less. The length of vertical curve on minor streets shall be
forty feet (40') for each one percent (1%) of algebraic difference of grade,
but in no case shall such length be less than forty feet (40'). The length of
vertical curve on collector streets shall be fifty feet (50') for each one
percent (1%) of algebraic difference of grade, but in no case shall such length
be less than fifty feet (50').

base course, type B) having a wearing surface of bituminous concrete binder and
surface course, class 1, having a minimum thickness of two and one-half inches
(21/2"), and also a minimum bituminous aggregate mixture of six inches (6")
compacted thickness with a similar two and one-half inch (21/2") bituminous
concrete binder and surface course is permissible. When a frontage road is to
be dedicated to public use, the specifications shall be in accordance with the
owner or lessee. To use the same private frontage road or parking lot, a trust
indenture shall be recorded before approval of the multi-family, commercial or
industrial subdivision.
A minimum distance may be required by the planning commission where deemed
necessary between points of ingress and egress where all property to be
subdivided is under one ownership on the effective date hereof. Where property

for a 5-year storm event. Computations will be required to show that the
streets or other surface drainage facilities are capable of safely conveying
the 100-year storm runoff without damage if the storm sewer is plugged or
otherwise nonoperable. The runoff coefficient (C factor) shall be determined by
the character of the land to be drained and shall conform to accepted standard
engineering practices. Street grades and lot and block drainage shall be
established so as to permit positive drainage.
         d.   Any outfall storm sewer that drains into an existing open ditch
or natural watercourse shall have a reinforced, concrete headwall and a
concrete apron for erosion control at least ten feet (10') in radius from the
center point of the outfall, or as determined by the size of sewer, velocity of
flow, and topography.

the subdivision, the subdividers and property owners using storm sewer lines
with larger capacity than required to serve a particular subdivision shall
compensate the original subdivider for his additional expense by paying him the
difference in cost between the size required for the original subdivision and
the larger size required by the Wenona city council pursuant to an agreement
entered into between the subdivider and the city of Wenona.
         g.   Storm sewer materials shall be made of materials as approved by
the city of Wenona engineer. All inlets, catch basins, or manholes shall be
made of precast reinforced concrete with steps, unless permission is granted by

grates and frames in the curb and gutter shall be all type 3 frame and grate
standard as described in the "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge
Construction".
         h.   (1)   Storm Water Detention; Required: A combination of temporary
storm water storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be
required for all nonresidential developments of two (2) or more acres in area,
for all multiple- family developments of two (2) or more acres in area, and all
single-family developments of five (5) acres or more in area.
            (2)   Storm Water Release Rate: The release rate of storm water
from all development requiring detention shall not exceed the storm water
runoff rate from the project area in its natural, undeveloped state. A release
rate of not greater than that calculated from a 5-year rainfall with a runoff
of fifteen one- hundredths (0.15) will be acceptable. The minimum size of the
discharge outlet shall be four inches (4").
            (3)   Capacity Of Bypass: Storm sewer systems, streams and channels
shall have an adequate capacity of bypass through the development for the flow
from all upstream areas for a 100-year storm design frequency, assuming that
the land is in fully developed state under present zoning and/or land use
proposed under the comprehensive plan. The bypass flow rate shall be computed
utilizing a runoff coefficient of not less than thirty five one- hundredths
(0.35). An allowance, equivalent to the reduction in flow rate provided, will
be made for upstream detention in which such upstream detention and release
rate has previously been approved by the city of Wenona and has been
constructed.
            (4)   Storage Volume; Additional Detention:
               (A)   The live detention storage to be provided shall be
calculated on the basis of a type II, 100-year, twenty four (24) hour rainfall,
as published by the Illinois state water survey (ISWS) circular 172 for this
area. The detention volume required shall be that necessary to temporarily
store the runoff of the 100-year, twenty four (24) hour rainfall from the fully
developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir, less the volume discharged
during the same duration at the approved release rate.
               (B)   In the event the downstreams and channels are inadequate
to receive the release rate hereinabove provided, then the allowable release
rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the existing receiving
downstream storm sewers, streams, and channels, and additional detention, as
determined by the city of Wenona engineer, shall be required to store that
portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers, streams,
and channels.
            (5)   Plans, Specifications, And Calculations:
               (A)   Plans, specifications, and calculations for storm water
detention facilities as required herein, shall be submitted to the planning
commission and city of Wenona engineer for approval prior to the commencement
of construction.
               (B)   The method to be used for calculating the volumes of water
to be stored and/or released shall be technical release (TR) 55, by the soil
conservation service, U.S. department of agriculture.
               (C)   All information and data required and submitted shall be
prepared and bear the seal of an Illinois licensed professional engineer.
         i.   The completed storm sewer system shall be inspected by television
camera or other similar monitoring device before final acceptance of the system
by the city of Wenona; such cost shall be the responsibility of the city of
Wenona. (Ord. 070102C, 7-1-2002)

7-1-12: SERVICE CONNECTIONS:
The laying of all water service connections and pipes, setting of water service
fixtures in streets and public grounds to be served by the City, shall be made
by the employees of the City Water and Sewer Department or by duly licensed
plumbers under supervision of the Water and Sewer Department. (1994 Code)
7-1-13: SERVICE PIPES:
   A.   Where Laid: No consumer shall be permitted to conduct water pipes
across lots or buildings to adjoining premises. All service pipes shall be laid
on streets, alleys or public grounds to the premises to be served, and enter at
the front or rear of the building nearest the main.
   B.   Construction:
      1.   That portion of the water service pipe from the water main to the
meter must be laid of copper, Type K, or plastic pipe of at least one hundred
sixty (160) pound test.
      2.   No water service pipe or tap for any building shall be less than
three-fourths inch (3/4") in diameter.
      3.   Plumbers installing water service pipes shall close the curb shut-
off and leave it closed upon completion of their work and when pipes are laid
to the curb, only they shall close the end of the pipe or fitting with a tight
metal plug or cap.
   C.   Connections Between Different Services Prohibited: When there are two
(2) or more services on premises, the piping from each service must be kept
separate, and no connection made from one to the other.
   D.   Depth: Service pipes must be laid at least four feet (4') below the
surface of the ground. When pipes are laid in streets or grounds subject to
fixed grades, where the surface of the ground is higher than the established
grades, they shall be so laid that they will be at least four feet (4') below
the established grade, except in sandy soil formation, the City Council may
require pipes be laid to a depth of at least five feet (5') below the
established grade.
   E.   Maintenance: All service pipes and fixtures to and including shut-off
at the property line including the corporation cocks at the main shall be
installed and maintained at the expense of the City and any leaks in the same
shall be repaired by the City and the Water and Sewer Department shall have the
authority to shut off water for a reasonable time in order to make such
repairs. All water pipes and fixtures from the shut-off valve to the meter
shall be installed and maintained by the property owner. All repairs to service
pipes and fixtures from the shut-off valve to the meter shall be maintained and
paid at the expense of the owner and any leaks or other defects shall be
properly repaired by them. If not properly repaired, the water shall be turned
off until such repairs have been made and the expense therefor shall be charged
against such owner and must be paid before the water shall be turned on again.
   F.   Breakage: The City shall not be held responsible by reason of the
breaking of any service pipe or apparatus, water coil, or for failure in the
supply of water.
   G.   Abandoned Pipes: All service pipes that may become useless because of
laying of larger or other new services or because water will no longer be used
through them may be permanently closed off at the water main at the expense of
the owner of the premises and so reported to the Water Collector. No plumber or
owner of property shall disconnect or remove water supply fixtures or piping
from any premises served by the City Water and Sewer Department or alter the
same in such a way as to make the service connection unnecessary for the
premises without permanently closing off the connections at the water main and
reporting the same to the Superintendent of Water and Streets.
If a service pipe or connection which is not being used is found to be leaking,
the City Water and Sewer Department may, without notice, repair or turn off the
same and charge the expense thereof to the owner of property for which the
connection was made. (1994 Code)
7-1-14: SEPARATE CONNECTIONS:
There shall be separate service pipes laid from the main to each building
wherever there is a water main laid in front or rear of such building. The mode
of entry should be at the discretion of the Water and Sewer Department. Where
services are laid to premises where there are no water mains available for
direct connections, a small temporary main will be permitted to be laid as
hereinafter provided under Section
7-1-17. In all cases each building served must have an independent service
shut-off. (1994 Code)
7-1-15: SERVICE CURB COCKS:
   A.   A curb stop box and shut-off for controlling the supply of water to
consumers shall be placed on every service. When connections are made in
streets or avenues, the stop box shall be placed twelve inches (12") outside
the sidewalk line on the street side; and when made in alleys, it shall be
placed twelve inches (12") outside the lot line. The cover of said stop box
shall be maintained at the same height as the sidewalk or the surrounding
ground. Where area walls or curb lines prevent the location of stop box and
shut-off at the point indicated, they shall be placed immediately within the
area wall or curb line. All stop boxes must be set on a line drawn at right
angles to the main through the service corporation or connection in the main.
   B.   Every service pipe must also have a stop and waste placed in the
building within nine inches (9") of the point where the pipe enters the
building. Said stop must have a handle or wrench attached to turn the same, and
be kept in working order at all times so that the water may be shut off by the
occupant of the premises. There shall also be a gate valve placed on the outlet
side of the water meter not more than three feet (3') from the meter, so that
the meter can be taken out or replaced without draining the pipe system in the
building.
   C.   All stop cocks on the line of service must have round ways of the same
diameter as the pipe with which they are placed and with proper handles for
turning on and off, and of a make and pattern approved by the Water Collector.
   D.   Whenever a meter cannot be set on the premises without danger of
freezing, difficulty of reading or other cause inimical to the Water and Sewer
Department service, the Water Collector may demand the installation of an
outside meter box and shut off; type to be designated by him.
In lieu of the stop box herein described, the Superintendent of Water and
Streets may demand the installation of an outside meter box and shut off; type
to be designated by him.
The stop box used shall be of a design approved by the Superintendent of Water
and Streets, and must have an unobstructed opening at least two inches (2") in
diameter and fitted with a substantial cover on which shall be marked the word
"Water" in raised letters.
   E.   The outside shut-off and stop box shall be under the sole control of
the City Water and Sewer Department and no one except an employee or person
specially authorized by the City Water and Sewer Department shall open the
cover of such box, or turn on or off water; provided, however, that licensed
plumbers may turn on or off water for testing plumbing or making repairs, but
whenever so used, the shut-off must be left closed if found closed, and open if
found open, by the plumber who uses it. (1994 Code)
7-1-16: RIGHT TO SHUT OFF WATER:
The City may, when necessary, without notice, shut the water off in its mains
for the purpose of making repairs or extensions or for other purposes, and no
claims shall be made against the City by reason of the breakage of any service
pipe or service cock, or from any other damage that may result from shutting
off water for repairing, laying or relaying mains, hydrants, or other
connections. The City Water and Sewer Department shall give notice of shutting
off water if conditions are such that it is possible to do so.
When water is shut off for making repairs in premises having water heat-coils
in heaters, consumers should turn off the water at the basement shut-off and
open a faucet in the hot water pipe and leave it open until water is turned on
in order to protect piping and fixtures from excessive pressures from hot water
or steam. (1994 Code)
7-1-17: TEMPORARY MAINS:
   A.   Pipe laid temporarily in the streets where there are no water mains
must be laid in the line where water mains will be laid in the future, and if
under four inches (4") in size the service pipe must be of copper Type K or
plastic at least one hundred sixty (160) pound test from the main to the meter
and from meter to the premises to be served. The location of the meter shall be
designated by the Water Collector.
   B.   Temporary mains shall be laid at the expense of the party to be served
through service.
   C.   The permit for any temporary main shall provide that the size of such
main shall be designated by the Water and Sewer Department subject to the
approval of the City Council and shall be of a size as to allow other party
connections to be made to such main if requested by intervening property owners
or to allow any further extension which may be deemed necessary by the Water
and Sewer Department.
   D.   The Water and Sewer Department shall determine on a just and equitable
basis any amount due the original party granted a permit to lay such main,
whenever any future permit for connection on such main is granted by the Water
and Sewer Department and shall be paid by party requesting such connection to
party who laid such main under original permit.
   E.   However, if at any future time, the City deems it necessary to extend
its regular water service for the purpose of fire protection on any street or
alley service and paralleling such temporary main, then all consumers being
served by such temporary main shall abandon their service connection with such
temporary main and establish a new connection with the regular City main so
installed.
   F.   All service connections with regularly laid City water mains shall be
made before the beginning of any paving constructed on any street or alley so
designated by the City Council to be paved. All property owners abutting such
street or alley designated to be paved shall, upon being notified of such
improvement, immediately establish such connections with the water main serving
said street or alley ordered paved; provided, however, if such connection to
water main is not made when requested, the City may, at its discretion, make
such necessary connection before paving said streets or alleys and charge the
cost of same to the abutting property owners served by said mains.
   G.   No permit shall be granted for the opening of any pavement for the
purpose of making water connections until a period of two (2) years has elapsed
after such paving. (1994 Code)
7-1-18: APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE:
   A.   Application for water must be made by the owner of the premises to be
served or his authorized agent to the superintendent of water and sewer at the
city office, stating the street and number and when such water is desired and
shall be made upon blanks furnished by the water and sewer department for this
purpose.
   B.   If the meter is to be installed in a new or remodeled building or
structure, the applicant must have no outstanding water and sewer bills, and if
all charges for water and sewer previously furnished such applicant, and all
other charges due for services furnished or to be furnished at such premises by
the water and sewer department have been paid, and if a suitable place is
provided for the meter, then the superintendent of water and sewer shall cause
a meter to be set and the water to be turned on to the stop inside the basement
where the owner or occupant may turn on the water into the piping system and
fixtures of the premises. (1994 Code)
   C.   No person, either owner or tenant, who, in changing his residence from
one location to any other location served by the water and sewer department,
shall be given water service until any and all delinquent water rentals which
are charged against him at a former place of residence shall have been paid in
full. No water at a new location shall be turned on, and, if so, shall be
turned off until settlement of such delinquent water rental at a former
location is made. A charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) will be made for turning
on water and renewing service. (Ord. 110397, 11-3-1997)
   D.   Proper records and accounts of each consumer shall be made in the water
and sewer department office. (1994 Code)
7-1-19: RESPONSIBILITY IN TURNING ON WATER:
In turning on water, the city or the water and sewer department shall not be
responsible for any damage that may occur by reason of improper fixtures, open
or improper connections or for any other causes. (1994 Code)
7-1-20: DISCONTINUANCE OF USE; NOTICE:
Owners or consumers desiring to discontinue the use of water shall give notice
thereof, in writing, to the superintendent of water and sewer at the city
office who shall then cause the water to be turned off and/or the meter
removed. Water rents or charges for services shall be made until such notice is
given. When water service is discontinued, all water rentals for such service
shall become due and payable. When water service is again desired after having
been discontinued, a charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be made and
collected before turning on water and renewing service. (Ord. 110397, 11-3-
1997)
7-1-21: UNNECESSARY WASTE:
Consumers shall prevent unnecessary waste of water and keep all water outlets
closed when not in actual use. If unnecessary waste of water takes place, the
water and sewer department reserves the right to cut off the supply. The city
reserves the right to prohibit the use of water for yard sprinklers, elevators
and large consumers of water when in the judgment of the city it shall be
necessary to do so. (1994 Code)
7-1-22: WATER METERS:
   A.   Meters Required:
      1.   All water furnished consumers shall be metered. All meters shall be
furnished and set by the water and sewer department, but owners must provide
suitable location in piping system for same. Meters shall be placed on service
pipe not to exceed two feet (2') from the wall where such pipe enters the
premises. There shall be a stop and waste between the meter and the wall and a
suitable place provided for the meter so as to keep it dry and clean and
readily accessible at all times to the meter reader and inspectors of the water
and sewer department. A gate valve shall also be placed on the pipe on the
outlet side of each meter not more than three feet (3') from the meter. All
valves and fittings necessary to comply with these requirements and to provide
connection to meter, except a coupling or flange at each end of the meter,
shall be provided by the owner of premises to be served.
      2.   For services larger than two inches (2") in diameter, the Water and
Sewer Department reserves the right to install two (2) or more meters of
smaller size. Where meters are so placed, each meter shall have a valve or
shut-off on both inlet and outlet pipe in addition to the basement shut-off.
      3.   Where a service pipe larger than two inches (2") in diameter is
used, the plumber shall call at the office of the Water and Sewer Department
for instructions regarding the fittings and space to be provided for the water
meters.
      4.   In case that two (2) or more meters are desired for measuring water
to different tenants in the same building from one service connection, they
shall be so placed that no one of them shall measure water which has passed
through another one.
      5.   Each residential home, apartment, private dwelling and place of
business, heretofore erected, established or structurally modified must be
equipped with a water meter furnished by the City.
      6.   All dwellings and buildings which are divided into apartments or
have an apartment in them shall have one of the following:
         a.   One water service into building with meter and shutoff for each
apartment and all will be billed separately; or
         b.   One water service into building with one water meter. The bill
will be the responsibility of owner/manager of the building and will be sent to
same. In this case minimum water and sewer rate will be charged for each unit,
plus any excess usage will be billed as used.
   "Apartment" will be defined as a unit having a bath and kitchen.
      7.   Meters shall be installed in a location that will be of easy access.
   B.   Owners to Protect Meters:
      1.   The owner or occupant of premises where a meter is installed shall
be held responsible for its care and protection from freezing or hot water and
from other injury or interference from any person. In case of any injury to the
meter, or in case of its stoppage or imperfect working, he shall give immediate
notice to the office of the Water and Sewer Department. In all cases where
meters are broken or damaged by negligence of owners or occupants of premises,
or by freezing, hot water, or other injuries, except ordinary wear and tear,
the necessary repairs to the meter shall be made by the Water and Sewer
Department and the cost of such repairs paid for by such owner or occupant, and
in case payment thereof is neglected or refused, the water supply shall be
turned off and shall not be turned on until full payment has been made,
together with five dollars ($5.00) for turning on the water again. Damaged
meters may be repaired by the Water and Sewer Department without first giving
notice thereof to the owner of premises served by such meter.
      2.   No one shall in any way interfere with the proper registration of a
water meter, and no one except an authorized employee of the Water and Sewer
Department shall break a seal of a meter; provided, however, that the
Superintendent of Water and Sewer may grant written permits to licensed
plumbers in case of emergency to break such seal for draining pipes or stopping
water leaks.
      3.   Wherever a water meter is installed on a water service in premises
that are to be remodeled, removed or destroyed, or where the service is
discontinued so that the water meter is no longer needed, the owner of such
premises shall give notice to the Superintendent of Water and Sewer to remove
such meter, and free access to such meter must be provided at least twenty four
(24) hours after notice is given so that the meter may be removed. The owner of
the premises shall be held responsible for the meter until such written notice
is given, and if the meter is covered or lost, he shall be required to pay for
the same at the actual value.
   C.   Testing Meters:
      1.   In case there is doubt as to the accuracy of a water meter on the
part of the consumer, he may have the meter tested by the Water and Sewer
Department, at which test he may be present or have a representative present if
he so desires, and if the meter is found to register within two percent (2%) of
being correct, a charge of two dollars ($2.00) will be made to pay for a part
of the labor for making such tests. If the meter is found to measure more than
two percent (2%) incorrectly, no charge shall be made for making the test. If
the meter should be found to over-register more than two percent (2%), there
shall be a proportional deduction made from the previous water bill. A water
meter shall be considered to register satisfactorily when it registers within
two percent (2%) of accuracy.
      2.   If upon investigation and testing of the meter the consumer is
dissatisfied with the bill as then rendered, he may, within five (5) days after
the investigated or corrected bill is rendered to him, file with the mayor or
the city council a complaint, in writing, setting up the grounds of his
complaint. Within five (5) days of the receipt of said complaint, the city
council shall pass on said bill and complaint, and the decision of a majority
of said council shall be final.
      3.   Penalty for nonpayment of a bill in the time required by this
chapter shall attach unless decision is in favor of the consumer. (1994 Code)
7-1-23: WATER RATES:
   A.   The water rents or rates shall be established by the city council and
increased by three percent (3%) annually. The rates shall be collected for all
water consumption and water service rendered by the city for which each service
shall be by metered registration. (1994 Code; amd. Ord. 030512, 3-5-2012)
   B.   All water bills are due and payable fifteen (15) days after being sent
out. Any and all bills not paid on time shall be delinquent and charged a ten
percent (10%) penalty. (1994 Code)
   C.   Fifty (50) days after a bill has become delinquent the water may be
shut off from the premises and when so shut off shall not be turned on again
until all water rents and all other charges due for service to the consumer,
including a fifty dollar ($50.00) reconnection charge, have been paid. Water
will be turned on only during regular working hours. (Ord. 030606, 3-6-2006)
7-1-24: REFUND OF PAYMENT:
No refunds or discounts on water rentals shall be made on account of the
premises having been vacant or no water used, unless water has been shut off by
the water and sewer department upon written request of the owner or consumer.
(1994 Code)
7-1-25: ACCOUNTS; RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYMENT:
Water service accounts shall be kept in the name of the owner of the property
served, and only such owner shall be recognized as the consumer.
The owner of the premises served shall be held responsible for the payment of
all water rentals and all other proper charges in connection with water service
to the owner's premises. Payments will be accepted from tenants if tendered by
them, but accepting payments from tenants shall not subsequently relieve the
owner of the premises from the responsibility of paying water rentals or other
service charges when due. (Ord. 030512A, 3-5-2012, eff. 4-1-2012)
7-1-26: LIEN; FORECLOSURE:
In addition to any other remedy provided herein for the enforcement or
collection of any water tax or rent, all such rates or rents shall be a lien
upon the premises and real estate upon and for which the same is used or
supplied. Any such lien shall attach when the water bill becomes delinquent and
may be endorsed together with the costs and penalties by foreclosure in equity
in any court having jurisdiction in the same manner and with like force and
effect as the foreclosure of the liens of mortgage and trust deeds. (1994 Code)
7-1-27: CONNECTIONS FOR FIRE PROTECTION:
Service connections which are to be used exclusively for supplying water to
extinguish fire may be granted upon the following conditions:
   A.   Application for such connection shall be made, in writing, by the owner
of the premises to be served, or his legal representative, on a form furnished
by the water and sewer department, which shall include the provisions of this
section.
   B.   The applicant must furnish with the application a complete and correct
drawing or set of drawings, showing the location of the premises to be
supplied, together with location of all valves, pipes, hydrants, tanks,
sprinkler heads, and other appurtenances on the premises, the plans to remain
the property of the water and sewer department. The applicant shall also agree
to furnish the water and sewer department with drawings showing revisions to
piping and appurtenances whenever the same are made.
   C.   All fire service connections shall be installed by the water and sewer
department from the street main to a point just inside the wall of the building
or to the lot line where buildings are set back from the lot line. The owners
shall pay the cost of the labor and materials for such extensions, and ten
percent (10%) additional to cover overhead expense. All repairs to the service
pipe between street main and the building shall be done by the Water and Sewer
Department at the expense of the owner.
   D.   The Water and Sewer Department shall limit the size of fire protection
services where the street mains are of such size as to make it necessary in
order to protect public interest. If more than one service is installed to the
same premises, the piping system of one shall not be connected with the other
except by special permission from the City Council upon recommendation of the
Superintendent of Water and Streets.
   E.   No water shall be drawn from the fire service pipes for any purpose
whatever except for the extinguishment of fires, and no connection shall be
made between the fire service pipe system and the regular water supply of the
premises, and valves on those outlets, drain cocks, etc., placed on the pipe
system shall be a style that can be sealed by the Inspector of the Water and
Sewer Department, and when any such valve or cock is opened, the owner or
occupant of the premises shall notify the Water and Sewer Department so that
the same can be resealed at once. This subsection is not to be construed as
prohibiting a reasonable use of water for fire drills, draining of a system to
prevent freezing or other reasonable use in connection with proper fire
protection.
   F.   All fire protection systems supplied with water from the City service
shall be supplied exclusively with such water and no connection shall be
allowed with any other system drawing its supply from any other source whereby
the City water supply may be contaminated by the failure to close valves, or
leaking check valves, etc., and no auxiliary or secondary suction pipe to any
fire pump taking water from any contaminated source will be permitted.
   G.   Any fire protection system using water from any other source than the
City service shall be kept entirely separate from any such system supplied from
the City service.
   H.   All fire services shall be subject to inspection by the Inspector of
the Water and Sewer Department who will visit all premises having fire services
from time to time, and the owners or tenants shall give the Inspector all
reasonable facilities for making the inspection, and any information concerning
the same that he may require.
Care will always be taken that inspections will be made with as little
inconvenience to the owners or occupants as possible.
   I.   In any case when the owners or occupants of any premises are found to
be using water from a fire service for other purposes than fire protection, the
water shall be shut off from the same until the offenders shall give reasonable
assurance before the City Council that the offense will not be repeated, and a
charge of ten dollars ($10.00) will be required for turning on the water after
it has been shut off for this cause.
A second violation of this rule will be considered sufficient cause for cutting
the service off at the main and refusing to reconnect same while the offender
occupies the premises.
   J.   Failure to pay the cost of installing the fire service or any
subsequent repairs thereto, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the
bill, will be sufficient cause for turning off the water from the supply.
The City may require the owner of the premises supplied to furnish and install,
at his expense and under the direction of the Superintendent of Water and
Streets, an approved water meter and to keep the same in accurate operating
condition. (1994 Code)
7-1-28: CONTRACTORS' SERVICES:
When a temporary service is desired by contractors and builders for water to be
used on construction work, they shall make application to the Superintendent of
Water and Sewer and deposit with the Water and Sewer Department, the sum of
fifty dollars ($50.00) for a swing meter to be used on such services; provided,
however, that in lieu of a cash deposit, the application may be signed by three
(3) freeholders of the City as sureties who will guarantee payment of such
water service charges and the return of the meter in good order.
The charges for such water service shall be at the same rate as other services,
including minimum monthly charges. No one shall use water that is not measured
by a meter furnished by the Water and Sewer Department.
All swing meters shall be returned to the meter room of the Water and Sewer
Department office before November 1 of each year for reading and testing. A
penalty of five dollars ($5.00) per month shall be charged for swing meters
that are not returned as above specified. (1994 Code)
7-1-29: SUPPLYING OTHERS:
No consumer shall supply water to other persons, nor suffer them to take water
except by special permission from the Superintendent of Water and Sewer or his
agents. Where such permission is granted, the owner of the service from which
the water is taken shall be responsible for payment of the rates. (1994 Code)
7-1-30: ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY:
On premises where water is supplied from two (2) sources, the City water being
one of them, the piping system for City water must be entirely separated from
that of the other source. If other than City water is to be furnished premises
previously supplied with City water, the owner or his plumber must give notice
at the office of the Water and Sewer Department when he will make this change
and must also cut off the City water at the corporation cock and disconnect the
service pipe.
Premises now having direct connection between the City water supply and another
supply shall forthwith disconnect the same. (1994 Code)
7-1-31: INFORMATION AT PLUMBER'S RISK:
Such information as may be obtained from the records, maps, employees, etc., of
the Water and Sewer Department relative to the location of water mains and
service pipes, will be furnished to licensed plumbers and interested parties;
but the Water and Sewer Department does not guarantee the accuracy of the same.
(1994 Code)
7-1-32: INSPECTION:
The Superintendent of Water and Sewer or other officer or employee of the Water
and Sewer Department shall be permitted at all reasonable hours to enter the
premises or buildings of consumers for the purpose of reading meters and to
examine the water pipes and fixtures, and the manner in which water is used.
The Water and Sewer Department reserves the right to set or remove a meter,
whenever it is deemed advisable so to do. (1994 Code)
7-1-33: FIRE HYDRANTS:
   A.   No person, except members of the Fire Department or Department of
Streets and Public Improvements of the City or officers or employees of the
Water and Sewer Department of the City shall open any hydrant belonging to the
Water and Sewer Department between November 15 and March 1 of any year.
   B.   No person, except members of the Fire Department or Department of
Streets and Public Improvements of the City or officers or employees of the
Water and Sewer Department acting in the regular performance of their duties
shall open any hydrant belonging to the Water and Sewer Department at any time
without a permit in writing signed by the Superintendent of Water and Sewer.

title, or interest (including leasehold interest) in the ROWs but shall be
deemed to be a license only to use and occupy the ROWs for the limited purposes
stated herein. The rights granted to the Licensee by the City are and shall be
at all times subordinate to the City's right to ingress and egress and use the
public ROWs. All rights and obligations to the Licensee under this Agreement
shall be exercised by the Licensee at its sole cost and expense.
      (b)   This Agreement and the right it grants to use and occupy the ROWs
shall not be exclusive and does not, explicitly or implicitly, preclude the
issuance of other licenses to operate telecommunications facilities within the
City's municipal boundaries.
   4.   TERM AND FEES: The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of ten
(10) years, beginning on the date approved by the City Council and ending ten
(10) years thereafter, unless otherwise sooner terminated as provided for
herein. This License Agreement shall automatically renew for three (3)
consecutive additional five (5) year terms unless the Licensee provides written
notice to the City at least four (4) months before the expiration of the
initial term or any renewal term that Licensee does not intend to renew the
License for an additional term; provided, however; that the License shall only
renew if Licensee is in full compliance with this Agreement at. the time of
renewal.

(TIMFA) (35 ILCS 635/I0(d)) and timely pays the taxes imposed by the Simplified
Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (SMTT) (35 ILCS 636/5) to the State of
Illinois.
      (c)   Permits will be issued on a block by block basis and the Licensee
shall pay a processing charge of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each permit
or the actual costs incurred by the City with an engineering firm or other
consultant needed for the processing of the permit. The Parties may agree to
the submission and processing of permit applications in groups or sections;
however, the City may issue permits in such a manner as to allow sufficient
time for JULIE locates and site inspections.
   5.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY LICENSEE: Licensee represents and
warrants to the City that:
      (a)   Licensee has and will maintain all approvals, authorizations,
certifications, licenses, and franchises required by the State of Illinois, the
Federal Communications Commission and/or any other agency to provide the
communications Facilities and (b) all work performed by Licensee pursuant to
this Agreement shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, consistent
with any permit specifications, City standards, and other applicable
regulations.
   6.   TITLE AND CONDITION OF ROWs: It is understood and agreed that the City
makes no representations, warranties, or assurances with respect to the
following: the condition of the title or boundaries of the ROWs; the condition
of the underground duct or conduit; other utilities or facilities in the ROWs;
any other improvements or soils located on the ROWs; or the suitability of the
ROWs for the Licensee's intended use. The Licensee assumes all risks associated
with the placement, operation, and maintenance of the Facilities within the
ROWs and suitability of the ROWs for its Facilities. The Licensee accepts the
ROWs in an “As Is, Where Is” condition, including any environmental conditions,
and accordingly, the City shall not be held liable for any damages or
liabilities resulting from any actions that arise because of any claims
concerning the title, boundaries, or condition of the ROWs.
   7.   LOCATION: The location of the Facilities shall be approved by the
City's Engineer(or designee). The Licensee shall provide the City with accurate
plans showing the proposed vertical and horizontal locations of the Facilities
within the ROWs each time it submits a permit application. Unless agreed to by
the Parties, the minimum depth of cover for fiber optic facilities shall be
twenty-four inches (24") and the maximum depth of cover for fiber optic
facilities shall be forty-two inches (42"). Upon completion of the work
authorized by the permit, the Licensee shall provide “As built” drawings
showing the constructed location of the Facilities. Unless otherwise stated on
a permit issued by the City, the Licensee shall not locate the Facilities so as
to unreasonably interfere with the use of the ROWs by the City, by any utility,
by the general public, or by other persons authorized to use or be present in
or upon the public ROWs. As provided for in Paragraph 25(a), the Licensee shall
relocate, at its sole cost and expense, any part of its Facilities that are not
located in compliance with the permit requirements.
   8.   USE OF ROWS: In its use of the ROWs and any work to be performed
thereon, the Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances,
regulations, and requirements of federal, state, county, and local regulatory
authorities.
      (a)   All parts of the Licensee's Facilities shall be underground where
feasible. The Licensee shall use and occupy the ROWs to construct, install,
operate, use, repair, maintain, and. remove the Facilities, which shall be
limited to underground conduit and fiber telecommunications cable where
existing similar utilities are underground and related equipment and facilities
only, such “related equipment and facilities” shall not include Small Wireless
Facilities controlled by the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act (50 ILCS
840/1 et seq.), as now in effect or hereafter amended or codified, the same
being a public record of the State of Illinois.
      (b)   The ROWs shall not be used for the burning of refuse, the
accumulation and/or storage of debris or other material, or for any unsanitary
or unhealthful purposes; provided, however, limited short-term storage of
conduit, tarps, and fill dirt related to ongoing work in the immediate area is
permitted.
      (c)   Any unauthorized or impermissible use of the ROWs, not corrected
after the City issues a notice to the Licensee in accordance with Paragraph 25
(a), shall be deemed to be a material breach of this License Agreement.
      (d)   Unless agreed to by the Parties, the Licensee warrants that the
installation of the Facilities will be performed without any trenching or open
trenching, but rather by directional boring. If directional boring is not
possible for installation of the required Facilities, the Licensee agrees to
work with the City's Engineer, or designee, to determine the method of
installation to be used, and to obtain the permission of the City. Unless
agreed to by the City, the Licensee shall not disturb any pavement for the
installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of its Facilities. All
movement and storage of equipment and materials shall be confined to the area
designated by the City. All surplus excavated material shall be removed from
the ROWs and disposed of in accordance with any applicable laws or regulations.
All tree stumps, and other debris resulting from construction operations shall
be removed from the ROWs.
      (e)   If a utility pole or wireless support structure is within the
right-of-way of another agency, documentation that a permit has been applied
for from the other agency such as IDOT or Marshall and LaSalle Counties, or
other state or county permits may be required.
   9.   INSTALLATION, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE: As a condition precedent to
its right to access, use, or attach any of its Facilities, the Licensee shall,
prior to occupying any area, submit a site-specific permit application for each
location, including all design plans and receive from the City Engineer (or
designee) a site-specific permit for each location. The City Engineer (or
designee) may request additional information if necessary to process the
application.
      (a)   Unless otherwise provided by law, the City reserves the right to
refuse to approve or authorize any permit application when it determines that
space in a ROW is inadequate to accommodate the Licensee's Facilities. All
terms and conditions contained in this Agreement shall be incorporated into
each individual permit obtained for each location. The installation, operation,
and maintenance of the Facilities shall comply with all applicable ordinances,
statutes; laws, or regulations.
      (b)   The Licensee, in the performance and exercise of any of its
authorizations and obligations under this Agreement, shall not obstruct or
interfere in any manner with the City ROWs, existing utility easements, private
rights of way (unless written permission is granted by the property owner and
provided to the City), sanitary sewers, sewer laterals, watermains, storm
drains, gas mains, poles, aerial and other existing telecommunications
facilities without the express written approval of the City or the other owners
of the affected property. If the Licensee proposes to install its Facilities on
a non-City owned utility pole in the ROW, the Licensee shall submit its written
agreement with the licensee which owns the existing utility pole as part of its
site-specific permit application.
      (c)   Maintenance of the Facilities within the ROWs shall be the
responsibility of the Licensee. The Facilities shall be maintained in good and
safe condition and in a manner that complies with all applicable federal, state
and local laws, regulations and policies. The Licensee shall use due care to
insure that no damage, beyond reasonable wear and tear, is caused to the ROWs.
The Licensee shall, immediately or within up to forty-eight (48) hours based
upon the urgency of the situation, report any damage it causes to any affected
party in writing. The Licensee shall reimburse the other party for any damage
caused by its employees, contractors, subcontractors, agents, representatives,
or its facilities.
      (d)   Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary herein, in the event
of an unexpected repair or emergency (“Emergency Maintenance”), the Licensee
may access the ROWs and commence such Emergency Maintenance work as required
under the circumstances.
   10.   MARKING:
      (a)   Prior to and during any installation or relocation of any
underground cables or utility lines, the Licensee shall contact JULIE to
ascertain the presence and location of existing aboveground and underground
facilities within the ROWs to be occupied by the Licensee's Facilities and
install route markers in accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities
Damage Prevention Act, as now in effect or hereafter amended or codified, the
same being a public record of the State of Illinois.
      (b)   The City shall have no obligation to mark the location of the
Licensee's Facilities. The Licensee agrees that it will become a member of
JULIE as a requirement of this Agreement and that such a system is designed to
alert the Licensee to planned work in the rights-of-way, so that the Licensee
can mark the location of its facilities to avoid damage. The City shall have no
obligation to alert the Licensee to proposed work by itself or others, other
than as a participating member of the JULIE system. Use of JULIE will not
alleviate the Licensee's responsibility to provide plans showing the vertical
and horizontal location of all Facilities within the ROW and complying with
location requirements as set fo,th in Paragraph 7 of this Agreement.
   11.   PUBLIC SAFETY: The Licensee or other persons acting on its behalf, at
its own expense, shall use suitable barricades, flags, flagmen, lights, flares,
and other measures as required for the safety of all members of the general
public and to prevent injury or damage to any person, vehicle, or property by
reason of any work in or affecting the ROWs or other property.
      If the City, in its reasonable discretion, determines that a particular
use of the ROWs by the Licensee is, or will be, hazardous to the public or the
property, the Licensee, upon written notice from the City, shall install
commercially reasonable safety devices or make commercially reasonable
modifications at the Licensee's sole expense to render the ROWs safe for, and
compatible with, public use. In the event the Licensee fails to install such
safety devices or make required modifications within a specified time which
will be between two (2) hours to twenty-four (24) hours based upon the urgency
of the situation and the nature of the safety hazard, or, if such modifications
cannot be completed expeditiously to render the ROWs safe for the public, the
City may install such safety devices. In the event the City installs such
safety devices, the Licensee agrees to pay the actual costs of such
improvements upon written demand, or the City may terminate this Agreement,
with all rights of the Licensee hereunder being forfeited, and the Licensee
waives all rights and claims of any kind against the City arising out of this
Agreement and its termination.
   12.   RESTORATION OF ROWS: Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, within
ten (10) business days after initial construction operations have been
completed or after repair, relocation or removal of the Facilities, the
Licensee shall grade and restore all areas disturbed by construction operations
to a condition substantially similar to that which existed prior to the work.
This time period may be extended for good cause shown. If weather or other
conditions do not permit the complete restoration required by this Paragraph,
the Licensee shall temporarily restore any disturbed property. Such temporary
restoration shall be at the Licensee's sole expense and the Licensee shall
promptly undertake and complete the required permanent restoration when the
weather or other conditions permit such permanent restoration.
      (a)   For a period of twelve (12) months following any work in the ROWs
by the Licensee or any person acting on the Licensee's behalf, except for
backfilling which shall be a three (3) year period, the Licensee shall, at its
sole expense, be responsible for all costs of restoring any disturbances or
damage to the ROWs or any other City property and for all repairs or damage to
City property caused by the Licensee, its officers, agents, employees,
contractors, subcontractors, successors, and assigns, except to the extent any
of the foregoing are caused by the negligence of the City. All such restoration
shall be performed to the reasonable satisfaction of the City.
      (b)   Disturbed grass areas shall be restored with seed and blanket to
the satisfaction of the City. All open excavations necessary for the
installation, repair, relocation, maintenance, or removal of the Facilities
shall be properly backfilled, and any asphalt pavement or PCC concrete pavement
or sidewalk shall be replaced with like-kind and quality of materials. The
backfill settlement repair period shall be for three (3) years from the date of
placing said backfill, during which time the affected areas shall be maintained
by the Licensee at its sole expense in a condition satisfactory to the City.
Under hard surface areas, such as roadways, sidewalks, and drives, trench
backfill shall be compacted and certified by the City to comply with the City
construction standards. All restoration work shall be completed in accordance
with City zoning or construction standards, whichever is more stringent and/or
comprehensive.
      (c)   In the event the Licensee fails, .in a timely manner, to restore
any disturbances or make any and all repairs to the ROWs or other City property
as set forth above, the City may make or cause to be made such restoration or
repairs and either demand payment from the Licensee, who agrees to pay the
reasonable costs of such restoration or repairs upon written demand and receipt
by the Licensee of all invoices and documentation supporting the actual costs
incurred by the City, or demand payment from the security posted by the
Licensee, which payment must be received by the City within thirty (30) days of
demand and receipt by the Licensee of all invoices and documentation supporting
the actual costs incurred by the City.
   13.   ENVIRONMENTAL: The Licensee shall not trim or cut any trees or shrubs,
alter or impede water flowage, apply chemicals, or disturb the topography of
the ROWs in any manner without prior written approval of the City. The Licensee
will take all reasonable steps to assure that the Licensee will not release any
regulated material in violation of any federal or state environmental law on
the ROWs. The Licensee, at its sole cost and expense, shall remediate, remove,
clean up, or abate in accordance with federal or state law, or directives of
the appropriate oversight agency, a release of a regulated material in
violation of a federal or state law occurring on the ROWs, to the extent such a
release was caused by the Licensee. In the event of a release of a regulated
material in violation of a state or federal law on the ROWs by the Licensee, or
any claim or cause of action brought against the City regarding such release,
the indemnification provided for in Paragraph I.7. shall apply.
   14.   DAMAGE TO THE LICENSEE'S FACILITIES: The City shall not be liable for
and .the Licensee expressly waives all claims for any damage to or loss of the
Licensee's Facilities within the ROWs as a result of or in connection with any
public works, public improvements, construction, excavation, grading, filling,
or work of any kind in the ROWs by or on behalf of the City unless such damage
or loss is caused by the sole negligence or willful or wanton misconduct of the
City or its employees or agents.
   15.   NO TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT: This License Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their successors and
assigns. During the term of this License Agreement, the Licensee acknowledges
and agrees that it does not have the right or authority to transfer or assign
this License Agreement or any interest herein without the prior written consent
of the City; provided however, that the Licensee shall have the right, without
the City's prior written consent, to assign or otherwise transfer this License
Agreement to any successor entity or affiliate or subsidiary of the Licensee,
or to any entity into which the Licensee may be merged or consolidated or which
purchases all or substantially all of the assets of the Licensee. Any such
written consent required under this Paragraph may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. Any transferee or assignee must, at a minimum, show
satisfactory evidence that it meets the insurance requirements and other terms,
conditions, and provisions contained herein. In the event the License herein
granted is terminated or the Licensee transfers title to the Facilities or
vacates or ceases to use the Facilities, the Licensee shall, nevertheless,
remain liable to the City under the provisions hereof, until said Facilities
herein authorized are removed, and the public ROWs are restored as herein
required. Acceptance of payment from an entity or person other than the
Licensee shall not constitute a waiver of this provision. In all instances, a
successor Licensee shall within ten (10) business days of substitution, notify
the City Clerk of its legal identity, address, email address, phone numbers,
and the identity of its responsible representative to the City.
   16.   INSURANCE:
      (a)   Required coverage and limits. The Licensee shall secure and
maintain the liability insurance policies specified by the City insuring it as
named insured and including the City and its elected and appointed officers,
employees, and agents as additional insureds as their interest may appear under
this Agreement. The Licensee shall provide the City with a certificate of
insurance and blanket additional insured endorsement. The Licensee's insurance
shall be primary, and any City policies of insurance shall be deemed non-
contributory. Such insurance shall be issued by companies authorized to do
business in the State of Illinois and reasonably approved by the City. The
insurance coverages shall include, but not necessarily limited to, the
following:
         (1)   Worker's Compensation Insurance with limits as required by the
applicable statutes of the State of Illinois. The Employer's Liability coverage
under the Worker's Compensation policy shall have limits of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) each accident/injury; five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000) each employee/disease; five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)
disease - policy limits.
         (2)   Commercial General Liability Insurance protecting the Licensee
against any liability claims which may result from or arise out of the
Licensee's use and occupancy of the premises and the operations conducted
thereon in the course of the license period. The limits of liability shall be
three million dollars ($3,000,000) per occurrence for bodily injury and
property damage and five million dollars ($5,000,000) general aggregate,
including contractual liability. The City and its elected and appointed
officers, employees, and agents shall be included as additional insureds as
their interest may appear under this Agreement.
         (3)   Commercial Automobile Liability Insurance covering the
Licensee's owned, non-owned, and leased vehicles with coverage limits of three
million dollars ($3,000,000) combined single limit each accident for bodily
injury and property damage, including contractual liability. The City and its
elected and appointed officers, employees, and agents shall be included as
additional insureds as their interest may appear under this Agreement.
         (4)   Umbrellas or Excess Liability Insurance with limits of not less

excess of the limits stated in subparagraphs (2) and (3) above and shall either
include an endorsement naming the City as an additional insured or provide
“following form” coverage for the primary insurance.
      The foregoing insurance coverages shall be increased upon written request
by the City to the Licensee but no more frequently than every three years and
only when increases in coverage in a category become routine in the insurance
industry in Illinois for the specified coverage. If the Licensee disagrees with
the proposed increase, it shall do so in writing no later than twenty-one (21)
days after it receives notice of an increase which writing shall explain the
basis of the objection. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement with
regard to the amount of an increase, the City and the Licensee's insurance
companies shall select a qualified third person insurance manager who shall
designate the amount of the coverage. Such designation shall be final, non-
appealable, and binding for the next three years.
      (b)   The Licensee shall provide certificates of insurance reflecting the
requirements of this Paragraph to the City within thirty (30) days following
notification that its application is complete.
      (c)   Upon receipt of notice from its insurer(s) the Licensee shall
provide the City with thirty (30) days' prior written notice of cancellation of
any required coverage and the Licensee shall obtain and furnish to the City
evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this
Paragraph. In the event that the Licensee fails to obtain or produce evidence
of said replacement insurance, any permits issued pursuant to this Agreement
shall, without any further notice, be null and void.
      (d)   The Licensee may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required by subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
The Licensee that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-
insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph or the requirements of subparagraphs
(b) and (c) of this Paragraph. The Licensee that elects to self-insure shall
provide the City evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit required under subparagraph (a) of
this Paragraph, such as evidence that the Licensee is a “private self-insurer”
under the Workers' Compensation Act. Self-insurance shall be primary, and any
City policies of insurance shall be deemed non-contributory. Self-insurance
shall only be allowed with the City's written approval, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
      (e)   Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The
legal liability of the Licensee to the City and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Paragraph shall not be limited by such insurance policies,
self-insurance, or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
      (f)   The Licensee shall make certain that all Supplements are covered by
the insurance required by this Paragraph 16.
   17.   INDEMNIFICATION: To the fullest extent permitted by Illinois law and
without regard to the availability or unavailability of any insurance, the
Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the City, its officers,
agents, employees and elected officials, from any loss, damage, demand,
liability, cause of action, fine, judgement, or settlement, together with all
costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable expert witness and
attorney fees), that may be incurred as a result of bodily injury, sickness,
death, or property damage or as a result of any other claim or suit of any
nature whatsoever arising from or in any manner connected with Licensee's use
or occupancy of the City's improvements or right-of-way associated with such
improvements by the Licensee or its employees, agents, or contractors arising
out of the rights and privileges granted under this Agreement, and other
applicable law.
      The Licensee has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of the City or its employees or agents. Neither Party will be liable
for consequential, indirect, punitive, incidental, or special damages
(including lost revenues, loss of equipment, interruption or loss of service,
or loss of data) for any cause of action, whether in contract,.tort or
otherwise, even if the Party was or should have been aware of the possibility
of these damages, whether under theory of contract, tort (including
negligence), strict liability or otherwise, however caused, based on any theory
of liability. The indemnification provisions set forth in this Paragraph shall
remain in effect for any claims based on occurrences during a license period.
   18.   RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES: Nothing in this Agreement shall
be interpreted or constitute a waiver, release, or to otherwise compromise the
Patties' common law or statutory privileges or immunities which are fully
reserved.
   19.   EXCLUSIVE REMEDY: The Licensee's exclusive remedy for the Licensor's
breach of all or any portion of this Agreement shall be specific performance or
termination of the Agreement including termination as it pertains to a specific
site.
   20.   THIRD-PERSON BENEFICIARIES: There are no third-person beneficiaries or
patties of this Agreement.
   21.   SECURITY: Prior to performing any work in the ROWs, the Licensee shall
establish a security fund in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000), which shall be provided to the City, at the Licensee's election, in
the form of cash or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to
the City. This security fund shall serve as security for the installation of
the Facilities in compliance with applicable plans, permits, technical codes
and standards, the proper location of the Facilities as specified by the City,
restoration of the ROWs and other property affected by the construction or to
satisfy any claims or damages. The City may draw on the letter of credit or
withdraw cash for the reasons set forth in this Agreement and require
replenishment by the Licensee.
   22.   DUTY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION: Within fifteen (15) days of a written
request from the City, the Licensee shall furnish any information requested
that is reasonably related to this Agreement, the License granted hereunder,
and any business activities related to the License or business operations of
the Licensee in the City.
   23.   NO ENCUMBRANCES: The Licensee shall not place or allow any liens,
mortgages, security interests, pledges, claims of others, equitable interests,
or other encumbrances to attach to be filed against title to the ROWs.
   24.   TAXES: Subject to Paragraph 3 of this Agreement, nothing contained in
this License Agreement shall be construed to exempt the Licensee from any fee,
tax, property tax levy, or assessment, which is or may be hereinafter lawfully
imposed on it relative to its use of the ROWs or its operation of the
Facilities, except as limited by the Telecommunications Infrastructure
Maintenance Fee Act (TIMFA) (35 ILCS 635/I0(d)) and timely payment of the taxes
imposed by the Simplified Municipal Telecommunications Tax Act (SMIT) (35 ILCS
636/5).
      If License should begin to provide either “cable service” or “video
service,” as those terms are defined in Section 21-201 of the Cable and Video
Competition Law of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-201), within the corporate limits of
City, the Licensee shall immediately become liable to the City for the service
provider fee allowed by Section 21-801 of the Cable and Video Competition Law
of 2007 (220 ILCS 5/21-801) and by subsection (c) of Section 253 of Title 47 of
the United States Code. The City shall be entitled - not more than once every
calendar quarter - to take reasonable measures to audit the services provided
by Licensee within the corporate limits of the City to determine whether those
services go beyond the “sale at retail,” as that term and component terms are
defined in Section 5-7 of the SMIT. The Licensee shall promptly cooperate with
the City's request to conduct such an audit of services.
   25.   REMOVAL, RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES: Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties or required by law, within sixty (60) days
following written notice from the City, the Licensee shall, at its own expense,
protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate,
change, or alter the position of any part of its Facilities within the ROWs
whenever the City has determined, in the exercise of its governmental
proprietary rights and powers, that such temporary or permanent removal,
relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction,
repair, maintenance, or installation of any City improvement in or upon, or the
operations of the City in or upon, the ROWs. The City's written notice to
Licensee to temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change, or
alter the position of any part of its Facilities shall sufficiently explain the
circumstances requiring removal, relocation, or modification. Licensee shall
have thirty (30) days to dispute the notice. In all instances, the Parties
shall work together in good faith to identify a mutually agreeable alternative
to removal or relocation. In the event that relocation of any or all of the
Facilities is required and the City and the Licensee are unable to identify an
agreeable alternative to relocation within the legally required or agreed to
time or the sixty (60) day period, then the City may terminate this Agreement,
without penalty or payment to the Licensee, solely with respect to the portion
of the ROWs required by the City for the above reasons or other public
purposes.
      If the Licensee is required to disconnect, relocate, remove, change, or
alter the position of part of all of its Facilities from the ROWs and fails to
do so within the time required by the City, the City may make or cause to be
made such disconnection, relocation, removal, change, or alteration, and the
Licensee shall be liable to the City for all costs regarding same. The City may
either demand payment from the Licensee, who agrees to pay the reasonable costs
of such relocation or removal upon written demand and receipt by the Licensee
of all invoices and documentation supporting the actual costs incurred by the
City, or demand payment from the security posted by the Licensee, which payment
must be received by the City within thirty (30) days of demand and receipt by
the Licensee of all invoices and documentation supporting the actual costs
incurred by the City.
      (a)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the City, the Licensee shall, at its own expense,
remove all or any part of any unauthorized facilities or appurtenances from the
ROWs. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following
circumstances:
         (1)   Upon expiration or termination of this License Agreement or
permit obtained by the Licensee, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
         (2)   If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior
grant of a license or permit;
         (3)   If the facility was constructed, installed, or maintained in
violation of this License Agreement; or
         (4)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not
permitted by any permit obtained by the Licensee.
         If the Licensee installs its facilities in a ROW without a permit for

effluent cannot meet the requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      2.   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated herein and/or which are in violation of the
standards for pretreatment provided in 40 CFR 403, June 25, 1978, and any
amendments thereto, and which, in the judgment of the City Council, may have a
deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving
waters or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public

   E.   Preliminary Treatment: Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   F.   Measurements, Tests and Analyses:
      1.   Each industry shall be required to install a control manhole and,
when required by the City Council, the owner of any property serviced by a
building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances, in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located and
shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City Council. The
manhole shall be installed by the owner at his own expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
      2.   The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying
industrial wastes shall provide laboratory measurements, tests and analyses of
waters and wastes to illustrate compliance with this Chapter and any special
conditions for discharge established by the City Council or regulatory agencies
having jurisdiction over the discharge.
The number, type and frequency of laboratory analyses to be performed by the
owner shall be as stipulated by the City Council, but no less than once per
year, the industry must supply a complete analysis of the constituents of the
wastewater discharge to assure that the Federal, State and local standards are
being met. The owner shall report the results of measurements and laboratory
analyses to the City at such times and in such a manner as prescribed by the
City. The owner shall bear the expense of all measurements, analyses and
reporting required by the City. At such times as deemed necessary, the City
reserves the right to take measurements and samples for analysis by an outside
laboratory service.
      3.   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in this Chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of IEPA Division of Laboratories Manual of
Laboratory Methods and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily
accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works
and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The
particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty four (24) hour
composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids
analyses are obtained from twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
where pH's are determined from periodic grab samples.
   G.   Special Agreements: No statement contained in this Section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City
and any industrial concern, whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the City for treatment, subject to payment
therefor, in accordance with Section
8-5-6 of this Chapter, by the industrial concern; provided such payments are in
accordance with Federal and State guidelines for user charge system. (Ord., 10-

9-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) probability of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year flood.
The base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section
9-1-3 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the
crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally aboveground including manufactured homes, prefabricated
buildings and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational
vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days per year.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of
the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital
services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk.
Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required
include: emergency services facilities (such as fire and police stations),
schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads
and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching stations or electrical
transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals,
petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances).
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to real estate including, but not necessarily
limited to:
   A.   Demolition, construction, reconstruction, repair, placement of a
building, or any structural alteration to a building;
   B.   Substantial improvement of an existing building;
   C.   Installation of a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a
manufactured home, or installing a travel trailer on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year;
   D.   Installation of utilities, construction of roads, bridges, culverts or
similar projects;
   E.   Construction or erection of levees, dams, walls or fences;
   F.   Drilling, mining, filling, dredging, grading, excavating, paving, or
other alterations of the ground surface;

facilities, resurfacing roads, or gardening, plowing, and similar practices
that do not involve filling, grading, or construction of levees.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed or buildings to be constructed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations
adopted by a community.
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation
of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of
utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the

hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations.
FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE): The elevation of the base flood plus one foot
(1') of freeboard at any given location in the floodplain.
FLOODPLAIN AND SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): These two (2) terms are
synonymous. Those lands within the jurisdiction of the city of Wenona, the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of Wenona, or that may be annexed
into the city, that are subject to inundation by the base flood. The
floodplains of the city are generally identified as such on panel number(s) as
17123C024 and 0250 of the countywide flood insurance rate map of Marshall
County dated November 4, 2010; and for those portions in LaSalle County, the
community based floodplain map panel 1704260001 dated December 2, 1998,
prepared by the federal emergency management agency. Floodplain also includes
those areas of known flooding as identified by the community.

truck and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
REPETITIVE LOSS: Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two (2)
separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for which the cost of repairs
at the time of each such flood event on the average equals or exceeds twenty
five percent (25%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
SFHA: See definition of Floodplain And Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement, was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement
of a manufactured home on a foundation. For a substantial improvement, actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: See definition of Building.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cumulative percentage of damage subsequent to the adoption of this chapter
equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed.
Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The term
includes "repetitive loss" buildings. (See definition of Repetitive Loss.)
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
improvement of a structure taking place subsequent to the adoption of this
chapter in which the cumulative percentage of improvements:
   A.   Equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the improvement or repair is started, or
   B.   Increases the floor area by more than twenty percent (20%).
"Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or
substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work done.
The term does not include:
   A.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
   B.   Any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of
historic places or the Illinois register of historic places.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the required federal, state, and/or local permits
and elevation certification is presumed to be in violation until such time as
the documentation is provided. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)

delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance rate map of
Marshall County and the community based map for the city of Wenona shall be
according to the best data available from federal, state or other sources.
Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the
applicant to determine base flood elevations.
   D.   The base flood elevation for the floodplains of those parts of
unincorporated Marshall and LaSalle Counties that are within the
extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city, or that may be annexed into the
city, shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood
insurance study of Marshall and LaSalle Counties prepared by the federal

   M.   Perform site inspections to ensure compliance with this chapter and
make substantial damage determinations for structures within the floodplain;
and
   N.   Maintain the accuracy of floodplain maps including notifying IDNR/OWR
and/or submitting information to FEMA within six (6) months whenever a
modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in
a change to the floodplain map. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)
9-1-5: DEVELOPMENT PERMIT:
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall
commence any development in the floodplain without first obtaining a
development permit from the building inspector. The building inspector shall
not issue a development permit if the proposed development does not meet the
requirements of this chapter.
   A.   The application for development permit shall be accompanied by:
      1.   Drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions;
      2.   Existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from
excavation or filling;
      3.   The location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to

below the base flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be
shown by survey data to be higher than the current base flood elevation and
which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance
rate map is not in the floodplain and therefore not subject to the requirements
of this chapter. In addition, any development located on land shown to be below
the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected to a flood source, but not
identified as floodplain on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to
the provisions of this chapter.
The building inspector shall maintain documentation of the existing ground
elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation
existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map
identification.
The building inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant
copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or permit not
required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The building
inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local
permits have been obtained. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)

9-1-9: PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER STANDARDS:
   A.   Public health standards must be met for all floodplain development. In
addition to the requirements of sections
9-1-6 and
9-1-7 of this chapter the following standards apply:
      1.   No development in the floodplain shall include locating or storing
chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, pollutants, or
other hazardous or toxic materials below the flood protection elevation unless
such materials are stored in a floodproofed and anchored storage tank and
certified by a professional engineer or floodproofed building constructed
according to the requirements of section
9-1-7 of this chapter.
      2.   Public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas and electric
shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      3.   Public sanitary sewer systems and water supply systems shall be
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      4.   New and replacement on site sanitary sewer lines or waste disposal
systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding. Manholes or other aboveground openings
located below the flood protection elevation shall be watertight.
      5.   Construction of new or substantially improved critical facilities
shall be located outside the limits of the floodplain. Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the floodplain if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or structurally dry
floodproofed to the 500-year flood frequency elevation or three feet (3') above
the level of the 100-year flood frequency elevation whichever is greater.
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities.
   B.   All other activities defined as development shall be designed so as not
to alter flood flows or increase potential flood damages. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-
2010)
9-1-10: CARRYING CAPACITY AND NOTIFICATION:
For all projects involving channel modification, fill, or stream maintenance
(including levees), the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be
maintained.
In addition, the city of Wenona shall notify adjacent communities in writing
thirty (30) days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or
relocation of the watercourse. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)
9-1-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific
development proposal, the applicant may apply to the board of appeals for a
variance. The board of appeals shall review the applicant's request for a
variance and shall submit its recommendation to the city council. The city
council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems
necessary to further the intent of this chapter.
   A.   Conditions: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant
demonstrates that all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The development activity cannot be located outside the floodplain.
      2.   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted.
      3.   The relief requested is the minimum necessary.
      4.   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety or
creation of a nuisance.
      5.   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
rescue or relief operations, policing, or repairs to roads, utilities, or other
public facilities.
      6.   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not establish a
pattern inconsistent with the intent of the NFIP, and
      7.   All other state and federal permits have been obtained.
   B.   Notification: The board of appeals shall notify an applicant in writing
that a variance from the requirements of the building protections standards of
section
9-1-7 of this chapter that would lessen the degree of protection to a building
will:
      1.   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to twenty
five dollars ($25.00) per one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage;
      2.   Increase the risk to life and property, and
      3.   Require that the applicant proceed with knowledge of these risks and
that the applicant acknowledge in writing the assumption of the risk and
liability.
   C.   Historic Structures: Variances to the building protection requirements
of section
9-1-7 of this chapter which are requested in connection with reconstruction,
repair, or alteration of a historic site or historic structure as defined in
"historic structures", may be granted using criteria more permissive than the
requirements of sections
9-1-6 and
9-1-7 of this chapter subject to the conditions that:
      1.   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      2.   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
   D.   Agriculture: Any variance granted for an agricultural structure shall
be decided individually based on a case by case analysis of the building's
unique circumstances. Variances granted shall meet the following conditions as
well as those criteria and conditions set forth in this chapter.
In order to minimize flood damages during the 100-year flood and the threat to
public health and safety, the following conditions shall be included for any
variance issued for agricultural structures that are constructed at grade and
wet floodproofed:
      1.   All agricultural structures considered for a variance from the
floodplain management regulations of this chapter shall demonstrate that the
varied structure is located in wide, expansive floodplain areas and no other
alternate location outside of the special flood hazard area exists for the
agricultural structure. Residential structures or animal confinement
facilities, such as farm houses, cannot be considered agricultural structures.
      2.   Use of the varied structures must be limited to agricultural
purposes in zone A only as identified on the community's flood insurance rate
map (FIRM).
      3.   For any new or substantially damaged agricultural structures, the
exterior and interior building components and elements (i.e., foundation, wall
framing, exterior and interior finishes, flooring, etc.) below the base flood
elevation, must be built with flood resistant materials in accordance with
section
9-1-7 of this chapter.
      4.   The agricultural structures must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structures in accordance with
section
9-1-7 of this chapter. All of the building's structural components must be
capable of resisting specific flood related forces including hydrostatic,
buoyancy, and hydrodynamic and debris impact forces.
      5.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located above the base flood elevation or floodproofed so that they are
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions in accordance with section
9-1-7 of this chapter.
      6.   The NFIP requires that enclosure or foundation walls, subject to the
100-year flood, contain openings that will permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwaters in accordance with subsection
9-1-7B of this chapter.
      7.   The agricultural structures must comply with the floodplain
management floodway provisions of section
9-1-6 of this chapter. No variances may be issued for agricultural structures
within any designated floodway.
      8.   Wet floodproofing construction techniques must be reviewed and
approved by the floodplain administrator and a registered professional engineer
or architect prior to the issuance of any floodplain development permit for
construction. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)
9-1-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city of Wenona or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)
9-1-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to
comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building inspector may
determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
building inspector shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
   A.   If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the
violation:
      1.   The city of Wenona shall make application to the circuit court for
an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order
as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Any person who violates this chapter shall upon conviction thereof
be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than seven hundred fifty
dollars ($750.00) for each offense.
      3.   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or
on which a violation occurs or continues, and
      4.   The city of Wenona shall record a notice of violation on the title
of the property.
   B.   The building inspector shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The building inspector is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension
of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing, indicate
the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to
resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a
hearing is held by the board of appeal. Written notice of such hearing shall be
served on the permittee and shall state:
      1.   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation,
and
      2.   The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence
on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of appeals shall
determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
   C.   Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Wenona from taking such other
lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected
therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 100410, 10-
4-2010)
9-1-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city council
to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program; provided,
however, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or ordinance
adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions.
Where this chapter and other ordinance, easements, covenants or deed
restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 100410, 10-4-2010)
