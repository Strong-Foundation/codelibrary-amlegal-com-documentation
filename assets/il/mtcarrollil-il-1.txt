Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of 1% per month, for all periods prior to the filing
of the application, but not more than four years before the date of filing the
application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not
be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the
date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined
and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid
tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the
underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case
the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
   (B)   The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days

verbal notice can be effected when the Water Department is assured that
imminent danger of harmful contamination of the public water supply system
exists. Such action shall be followed by written notification of the cause of
disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be
effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the
Superintendent of Water and Sewer Department or the state’s Environmental
Protection Agency, such action is required to prevent actual or potential
contamination or pollution of the public water supply. Neither the city nor its
agents or assigns shall be liable to any customer for any injury, damages or

year, an estimate of anticipated costs of operation, maintenance and
replacement for the forthcoming fiscal year, specifically including direct
operation and maintenance, administration, equipment replacement and

per thousand gallons of water use.
   (D)   (1)   The rate or charge for water usage shall be $8.25 per 1,000
gallons of water used. The minimum charge shall be computed based upon and

for the total water bill. Further, any moneys received from any collection
agency that the city has contracted to collect delinquent water bills shall be
applied to the proper appropriations accounts.
      (3)   For residential structures containing more than a single living
unit, but rather multiple separate units (as reflected by separate postal
services addresses or individual lease agreements) serviced by a single meter,
the rate charged for water usage shall be the same as outlined in division (D)
(1), with the exception that the total monthly debt service charge shall be
assessed as $22.50 per month plus an additional $7.00 per each separate unit.

§ 10-2-4 SPECIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Excavation. The trench shall be excavated so that the house service
line rests on good firm earth. If the excavation has been made deeper than
necessary, the foundation shall be brought up to proper grade by the addition
of well compacted sand or fine gravel. Where firm earth is not encountered at
established grade, due to the presence of soft spongy material or other
unsuitable soil, all such unstable material under the pipe shall be removed and
replaced with well compacted sand or fine gravel to provide a firm foundation
for the pipe. The width of the trench at the top of the pipe shall be
sufficient to permit easy access to the joints and shall be of such depth that
the house service line can be laid on a uniform grade of not less than one-
eighth inch of fall per lineal foot of line.
   (B)   House service pipe.
      (1)   All house service lines shall be constructed of first quality
vitrified clay six-inch sewer pipe, cast iron four-inch or six-inch sewer pipe,
or asbestos cement four-inch sewer pipe, or PVC plastic four-inch or six-inch
sewer pipe. The sewer pipe shall be of the bell and spigot type, straight,
smooth and sound, thoroughly burned, well glazed, free from lumps or other
imperfections and with the least possible variation from the specified
dimensions and of true cylindrical shape. All straight pipe must be straight in
the direction of the axis of the pipe, and the inner and outer surface of each
pipe must be concentric. The curves, slants and “Y” junctions and other
specials, where required, must conform to all the requirements with regard to
quality, form and workmanship and the thickness shall be equal to that of pipes
of the same caliber to which the special may be joined.
      (2)   The sewer tile used shall meet the standards of the American
Society of Testing Material for standard strength pipe where the cut is over
five feet and less than 12 feet. Where the cut is 12 feet or more, the sewer
tile used shall meet the American Society of Testing Material’s standards for
extra strength pipe. In no case shall pipe be used where excessive loads will
be encountered which does not meet the ASTM standards for the anticipated
loading.
      (3)   PVC plastic sewer pipe and fittings shall conform to the latest
revised specification requirements of ASTM D 3033 or ASTM D 3034 for polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) sewer pipe and fittings. Joints shall be either the solvent weld
type conforming to the latest revised specification requirements of ASTM D 2564
and ASTM D 2855, or elastomeric gasket type conforming to the latest revised
specification requirements of ASTM D 1869 and ASTM D 3212. Pipe and fittings
shall be the products of one approved manufacturer only, and there shall not be
any mixing of pipe and fittings of different manufacturers.
      (4)   PVC sewer pipe and fittings shall be installed in accordance with
the latest revised recommended practice of ASTM D 2321 using either Class I or
Class II embedment materials for bedding, haunching and initial backfill. The
pipe shall be properly embedded to provide adequate side support so that the
maximum deflection does not exceed 5% of the pipe’s original internal diameter.
   (C)   Pipe joints. A preformed polyvinyl joint, precast bituminous compound
joints and joints for cast-iron pipe only may be used. Cement joints are not
approved and shall not be used.
      (1)   Preformed polyvinyl joints. When a preformed polyvinyl joint is
employed, it shall be a true mechanical joint made from plasticized resins of
polyvinyl chloride. The joint shall be of the compression type and the surfaces
of both the bell and spigot ends shall be in uniform compression permitting
lateral movement without harm to either pipe or joint. The preformed polyvinyl
joint shall be jointed to the vitrified clay pipe during manufacture.
      (2)   Joints for cast-iron soil pipe. Joints for cast-iron soil pipes
shall be made by inserting a roll of hemp or jute and thoroughly caulking it
into place and then following with pure molten lead well caulked not less than
one inch deep. No paint, varnish or putty will be allowed in the joints until
they have been tested.
      (3)   Precast bituminous compound joints. When a precast bituminous
compound joint is employed, all joints shall be made in accordance with this
procedure. Before a joint is made, each collar shall be brushed with a solvent
recommended by the manufacturer of the joint material which will cause the
surface to become plastic or adhesive. All collars will be inspected before
being laid and any showing voids or injury will be rejected.
   (D)   Trenching and backfilling.
      (1)   All excavations shall be open trench work unless otherwise
authorized by the City Engineer. The foundation in a trench shall be formed to
prevent any subsequent settlement of the pipes. If the foundation is good, firm
earth, the earth shall be pared or molded to give a full support to the lower
quandrant of each pipe. Backfilling material shall be deposited in the trench
in such manner as not to damage the sewer pipe or change its grade and
alignment. Backfilling and tamping around the pipes shall be done by hand with
suitable tools to six inches above the top of the pipe. Only the finest of the
excavated soil shall be used for this purpose. The backfill shall be left with
a smooth, even surface and a sufficient crown.
      (2)   Where the work passes under paved streets or driveways or
sidewalks, all the backfill shall be well rammed, with suitable tools, in
layers not exceeding six inches in depth, providing the ground is clay, stiff
loam or of a tenacious nature. If the ground is sand or gravel, the backfill
shall be puddled in such manner as directed. After being puddled or rammed to
the required height, the pavement shall be reconstructed carefully and
thoroughly with the same kind of material and in the same manner as when
originally constructed and to the satisfaction of the city. Graveled streets
and driveways are to be replaced to their original condition.
   (E)   Restoration of surface. Any person who excavates any earth, under or
immediately adjacent to any street, avenue, alley, sidewalk, pavement or public
ground shall comply with all other ordinances pertaining to such excavations
and replace the earth by a mechanical method of compaction and compression
adequate to prevent settling and shall restore such street, alley, avenue,
sidewalk, pavement or public place to as good condition as it was before the
making of such excavation. Where any surfaced street is excavated, it shall be
backfilled only with pit run sand and gravel or crushed stone of a fine grade
with maximum size of one inch.
   (F)   Size of sewer. No sewer from the property line to the main sewer shall
be less than four inches in diameter.

(1974 Code, § 7-5A-1) (Ord. 654, passed 7-14-1981)
§ 10-2-26 SEWER USER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (A)   There shall be and there are hereby established sewer user service
charges for the use of and for the service supplied by the city sewerage works
which shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus
replacement, a debt service charge and a surcharge and penalties, if
applicable.
   (B)   The city shall prepare annually, prior to the close of the fiscal
year, an estimate of anticipated costs of operation, maintenance and
replacement for the forthcoming fiscal year, specifically including direct
operation and maintenance, administration, equipment replacement and
depreciation costs, which estimate shall be submitted to the City Council to be
considered, amended if necessary and adopted for the subsequent year by
ordinance.
   (C)   The basic user charge rate shall be calculated by dividing the amount
of revenue funds required to operate and maintain the sewerage works and to
provide funds for equipment replacement, by the total annual water use as
determined by users’ water meter readings and flat rate estimates and shall be
expressed in dollars per thousand gallons water use.
   (D)   The annual debt service charge shall be calculated by dividing that
portion of interest, principal and coverage of all revenue bonds outstanding
allocable to the sewerage works, plus bond reserve funds required by bond
ordinances of the city, by the total number of sewer users. The annual debt
service charge shall then be divided by 12 to obtain the monthly debt service
charge.
   (E)   Water usage shall be determined from readings taken from approved
water meters and/or sewage meters for wastewater and shall assume discharge to
the sewers of a wastewater having normal concentrations of 200 milligrams per
liter BOD and 250 milligrams per liter suspended solids.
   (F)   A treatment service surcharge shall be levied to all sewer users whose
wastewater exceeds the normal concentrations of 200 milligrams per liter of BOD
and 250 milligrams per liter of suspended solids as determined by waste
sampling which shall be performed as often as deemed necessary by the
Superintendent and shall be binding as the basis for computing the surcharge.
   (G)   The rates to be used in the computation of the sewer user service
charge shall be as follows:
      (1)   The basic user charge rate shall be $8.25 per 1,000 gallons of
water used per month per user. In addition a flat rate charge of $4 per month
per user shall be charged to fund the Capital Improvement Fund. User, as
relates to any structure containing more than one living unit, but rather
multiple separate units (as reflected by separate postal service addresses or
individual lease agreements) serviced by a single water meter shall be assessed
a Capital Improvement Fund fee of $4 per month for each unit served by the
meter, (e.g. for a four unit apartment structure, the amount would be $4 per
month multiplied by four units for a total of $16.00 per month) Further, that
the City Council shall establish a 2% rate increase to the basic sewer user
charge at the beginning of each fiscal year beginning May 1, 2024.
      (2)   There is hereby established an increase in the wastewater treatment
plant improvements fee a flat base rate at $10, with the current use rate based
on a resident’s metered water usage of $3 for each 1,000 gallons of metered
water usage, and the minimum rate shall be $16 and the maximum rate shall be
$28.
      (3)   Then, on May 1, 2020 and thereafter the wastewater treatment plant
improvements fee shall be a flat base rate of $28.00 for each residential user.
For purpose of defining “residential user” relating to any structure containing
more than one living unit, but rather multiple separate units (as reflected by
separate postal service addresses or individual lease agreements) serviced by a
single water meter, the fee shall be $28.00 per month for each meter plus an
additional $7.00 per each separate unit. (e.g. for a four unit apartment
structure, the amount would be $28.00 plus $28.00 ($7 x 4 units).
      (4)   Further, that the proceeds generated by the wastewater treatment
plant improvements fee rate increase created by this section shall be deposited
in a reserve account designated as the wastewater treatment plant improvements
account, and shall be utilized for that purpose exclusively.
      (5)   The surcharge rate for BOD shall be $0.30 per pound BOD in excess
of seventeen one-hundredths pounds per 100 gallons.
      (6)   The surcharge rate for suspended solids shall be $0.32 per pound
suspended solids in excess of twenty one-hundredths pounds per 100 gallons.
   (H)   The sewer user service charges for all users outside the corporate
limits of the city shall include a surcharge of 100% of the sewer user service
charges for users within the corporate limits of the city, except for
intergovernmental sewer service agreements. The purpose of such surcharge shall
be to recover capital costs of providing service which is not otherwise
recoverable from unincorporated users.
   (I)   (1)   The total sewer user service charge shall be computed according
to the following formula:
         C = a(WB + D + X) + P
      Where:
      C = Total sewer user service charge
      B = Basic user charge
      D = Unit debt service charge
      W = Water use
      a = Surcharge rate for unincorporated users
      X = Surcharge for excess strength
      P = Penalties
      (2)   The minimum charge shall be computed based upon and shall allow up
to 2,000 gallons water use per month.
   (J)   The adequacy of the sewer user service charges shall be reviewed
annually by the certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit
report. The service charges shall be revised periodically to reflect changes in
debt service or in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs.
   (K)   Metered usage shall be read to the lowest even increment of 100
gallons. Sewer users who obtain any portion of their water service from other
than public water supply sources shall install and maintain, at no expense to
the city, water meters of a type approved by the Superintendent for the purpose
of metering the water usage obtained from such other sources. Wherever required
by the Superintendent, sewage metering devices shall be installed and
maintained, at no expense to the city, when the volume of wastewater discharged
to the public sewer cannot be otherwise determined by use of water meters.
Metering devices shall not be removed without the consent of the Superintendent
unless sewer use service is canceled.
   (L)   The city shall read water meters located in meter manholes, outside-
reading water meters and, upon request, water meters in commercial or
industrial establishments. All other metered water users shall receive a mail-
in card on which the user shall record the water meter reading and return said
card to the city prior to 4:30 p.m. for the fifteenth day of the month
preceding the billing date. Failure to return said card properly filled out
prior to the aforementioned time on the fifteenth day of the month preceding
the billing date shall result in a $5 penalty assessment for the billing
period, and the service charges shall be based upon an estimated water use
consistent with previous usage.
   (M)   Whenever the Superintendent determines that a nonmetered sewer user is
discharging more 3,000 gallons per month, the Superintendent may require such
nonmetered sewer user to install metering devices on the building water supply
or building sewer to measure the volume of wastewater discharged to the public
sewer.
   (N)   Sewer user service charges shall be payable monthly on the first day
of each month. The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of
the service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service on
such premises and the service is furnished to the premises by the city upon the
condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the service are
jointly and severally liable therefor to the city. All user charges levied
under the provisions of this chapter shall become a lien upon the lands within
the sewerage system service area. All bills for service shall be rendered
monthly on the first day of the month and shall be payable not later than the
close of business on the fifteenth day of the same month, the close of business
being 4:30 p.m. on the fifteenth day of the month. If the fifteenth falls on
Saturday or Sunday when the City Collector does not have office hours, then the
bill for the service shall be payable not later than the close of business (4:
30 p.m.) on the following Monday. If payment of the full amount of the bill is
made after said period, then a penalty of 5% of the amount of the bill shall be
added thereto.
   (O)   In the event the charges for service are not paid within 30 days after
the date of billing for such service, such charges shall be deemed and are
hereby declared to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquencies shall
constitute liens upon the real estate for which such service is supplied, and
the City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to file sworn statements
showing such delinquencies in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the
county, and the filing of such statements shall be deemed notice for the
payment of such charges for service. In the event that any user fails to pay
the billed charge within 60 days after the date of billing, the city shall
serve termination notice upon such user and proceed to terminate service, as
provided hereinbelow.
   (P)   It is hereby declared to be a policy of the city that in the event any
person or other legal entity whose residence or other building is connected to
sewers which are tributary to the works of the system fails to pay the user
charges as assessed under this chapter, they shall, upon due process, be
disconnected. The following procedure, in the event of nonpayment of user
charges, shall constitute the procedure to be utilized by the city in
terminating service of such user.
      (1)   In the event that the payment of the user charge, after having been
billed in accordance with this chapter, remains unpaid 60 days thereafter, the
following notice shall be forwarded by registered mail, return receipt
requested, certified mail or personal service to the occupants at the address
of the building being served by the city:

      (2)   The City Council hereby declares that it is against public policy
for a building to be occupied by human inhabitants which has been red-tagged by
the city after appropriate notice has been given that the building is “unfit
for human occupancy”.
      (3)   In the event that such user charge remains unpaid on the thirtieth
day after the posting of the aforesaid notice, the following notice shall be
forwarded by registered mail, return receipt requested, certified mail, or
personal service to the occupants of the building and also thumbtacked or taped
to the front door of the building or housing unit within a building:

plus the cost of the disconnection and the $100 city supervision fee, the city
will issue a permit for reconnection of the building service line to the works
of the system. Such reconnection costs, plus inspection fees in accordance with
city ordinances, shall be the sole expense of the user.
      (2)   Upon reconnection and payment of all costs described hereinabove,
the city through its agents, shall remove the red tag from the building and the
building shall, as far as the city is concerned, be “fit for human occupancy”.

   The calculation for monthly sewer rate charges is based on water rate usage.
If a user gives the City at least 30 days advance notice of intent to use the
City water system for the filling of a pool, application of the water usage
component (to calculate the sewer bill) shall be modified for the next monthly
billing cycle. The formula, to be applied for that monthly billing cycle (e.g.
the month in which the pool is filled) will use 100% of the average water use,
based on the last three billing cycles if available. If not available,
historical use will be considered for use at the property from prior users
during the same monthly periods. This discount formula will not impact the
charge for actual water usage, on the monthly water rate charge billing.

§ 11-5-1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (A)   A community survives and improves by capitalizing on its assets and
attributes. Community improvement is necessary and important. The public
interest and well-being require that guidelines and controls are used not to
inhibit or constrain improvement, but rather to shape and channel such activity
to the benefit of the community.
   (B)   In a rapidly changing world, the stability of a small town can be used
to its advantage. The city can meet the needs of the future and provide a basis
for long-range planning by identifying, utilizing, and developing its current
assets. Such planning draws from both the past and the present to illuminate
the passageway to the future.
   (C)   A principal asset of the city is the duly recognized and registered
historic district. The district represents a large portion of the city’s
corporate limits. The major part of the business district is included in the
historic district, tying it and various aspects of the residential portion of
the district together as a homogeneous unit.
   (D)   The city has distinctive features in architecture, craftsmanship,
landscape design and relevant social and economic history. This chapter
provides a means for protecting, preserving and perpetuating these qualities
and is designed to encourage property owners to view their property with the
character of the community in mind. It encourages sensitive treatment of the
historical qualities of the property by owners in their choices of materials
and procedures and standards of workmanship. This chapter provides a framework,
the effect of which shall be to capitalize on the major assets of the city, its
people, sites and structures, and which will result in an enrichment of the
quality of the community for business, commerce, residence, education and
visiting.
   (E)   It is the purpose of this chapter to provide the procedures and
guidelines for the preservation, enhancement and perpetuation of the historic
district, the landmarks within and without the district and the overall
character and quality which they give to the city, as separate entities and as
an integral part of the community.

(1974 Code, § 2-8-6) (Ord. 9-85-04, passed 9-10-1985)
§ 11-5-7 ALTERATIONS.
   (A) Exterior architectural appearance. No person shall perform any
alteration, construction, demolition or removal or in any way affect the
exterior architectural appearance (for example, exterior painting is not an
“architectural change”) of any landmark, or any property within the historic
district without first submitting plans and specifications for the work under
consideration to the Historic Preservation Advisory Committee for review. Any
recommendation of the Committee is advisory. No building permit shall be issued
pursuant to §
12-3-2 of this code of ordinances, nor shall any work be initiated under the
exemption of §
12-3-2(A)(2) of this code of ordinances until this division (A) is complied
with.
   (B)   Proposed demolition.
      (1)   In the case of a proposed demolition, the Advisory Committee may
recommend to the City Council that a moratorium be established for the purposes
of investigating the effects of and alternatives to the proposed demolition.
      (2)   For example, exterior painting is not an “architectural change”.
   (C)   Standard for review of application. In considering an application for
an alteration permit, the Preservation Committee shall be guided by the
following general standards based on the Secretary of Interior’s guidelines.
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   Any work should not destroy the distinguishing qualities or
character of the property and its environment. The removal or alteration of any
historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when
possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures and sites should be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations to create an appearance inconsistent
with the actual character of the property should be discouraged.
      (4)   Many changes to buildings and environments which have taken place
in the course of time are evidence of the history of the building and
neighborhood. These changes may have developed significance in their own right,
and this significance should be recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
that characterize a building, structure or site shall be preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event that replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features,
substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence, rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to the project.
      (9)   Design for new construction, alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such design does not destroy
significant historical, architectural or cultural material and when such design
is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
(1974 Code, § 2-8-7) (Ord. 9-85-04, passed 9-10-1985)
§ 11-5-8 MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in the historic
district or on the landmark site which does not involve a change in design,
material or the outward appearance thereof; nor to prevent any alteration or
demolition which is required by public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous
condition.
(1974 Code, § 2-8-8) (Ord. 9-85-04, passed 9-10-1985)
§ 11-5-9 ZONING.
   Whenever application for a zoning map amendment, variation or special use
permit (including modification or renewal thereof) is submitted to the Planning
Commission for property within a designated historic district, or which is a
landmark site, then a notice of any public hearing to be held on the
application by the Planning Commission shall be sent to the Historic
Preservation Advisory Committee. Such notice shall be the same as that sent to
owners of property adjacent to that for which the application was filed. The
Historic Preservation Advisory Committee shall have the status of legal
objector, at the time of public hearing, and may submit its comments to the
Planning Commission, which shall consider such comments, decisions, or
recommendation on the application.

§§
11-6-6 and
11-6-7 subject to the conditions that:
      (1)   The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure; and
      (2)   The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being
removed as a certified historic structure.
(Ord. 2010-11-8, passed 11-23-2010)
§ 11-6-12 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free
from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part of
the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results
from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.

be fined not less than $50 or more than $750 for each offense;
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues; and
      (4)   The city shall record a notice of violation on the title of the
property.
   (C)   (1)   The City Attorney shall inform the owner that any such violation
is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
      (2)   The City Attorney is authorized to issue an order requiring the
suspension of the subject development. The stop-work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary,
to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop-work order. The stop-work order
constitutes a suspension of the permit.
      (3)   No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or
revoked until a hearing is held by the City Planning Commission. Written notice
of such hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
         (a)   The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or
revocation; and
         (b)   1.   The time and place of the hearing; and
            2.   At such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity
to present evidence on his or her behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
City Planning Commission shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended
or revoked.
   (D)   Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Ord. 2010-11-8, passed 11-23-2010)

§ 13-4-1 PURPOSE.
   Generally, design standard shall assure that the layout of the subdivision
harmonizes with existing plans affecting the development and its surroundings
and shall be in conformity with the comprehensive plan for the development of
the entire area.
(1974 Code, § 10-3-1) (Ord. 518, passed 3-25-1969)
§ 13-4-2 CIRCULATION.
   (A)   General street design.
      (1)   The design of all streets shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic, to
topographical conditions, to runoff of storm water and to the proposed uses of
the area to be served.
      (2)   Where new streets extend existing adjoining streets, their
projections shall be at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the
minimum required width.
      (3)   Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of
streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the proper projection of
streets. When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible to being
subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of such
unsubdivided land.
   (B)   Street width and grades. The following standards of street design
shall be observed by the subdivider.
 
Street Category Minimum Width Minimum Width Maximum Grade 1 Maximum Grade
                Right-Of-Way  Pavement
Collector       66 feet       40 feet       5%              0.5%
Local           60 feet       36 feet       6%              0.5%
1   To assure a safe and reasonable sight distance at intersections a
lesser or greater maximum grade may be required
 
   (C)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided.
   (D)   Street intersections. Insofar as practical, streets shall intersect at
right angles and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees.
It must be evidenced that safe and efficient traffic flow is encouraged.
   (E)   Culs-de-sac. Maximum length of permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be
400 feet measured along the centerline from the intersection of origin to end
or right-of-way. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having a minimum outside roadway diameter of 80 feet and a minimum
street property line diameter of 100 feet.
   (F)   Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where the City
Council finds it to be practicable to require the dedication of the other half
when the adjoining property is subdivided.
   (G)   Street names. Proposed streets obviously in alignment with existing
and named streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. In no case
shall the name of the proposed street duplicate existing street names,
including phonetical similarities.
   (H)   Private streets. Public improvements shall not be approved for any
private street.
   (I)   Access to arterial streets and highways. Where a proposed plat is
adjacent to a major thoroughfare, spacing between access points to such
thoroughfare of less than 660 feet shall be avoided except where impractical or
impossible due to existing property divisions or topography.
   (J)   Hardship to owners of adjoining property. The street arrangements
shall not be such as to cause hardship to owners of adjoining property in
platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.
   (K)   Corners. Curb lines at street intersections shall be rounded at a
radius of not less than ten feet.
   (L)   Alleys. Alleys shall be prohibited in residential areas unless special
permission is granted by the City Council for their provision. Alley
intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where
necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular
movement. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, but if unavoidable, shall be
provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end as determined by
the city consulting engineer.
(1974 Code, § 10-3-2) (Ord. 518, passed 3-25-1969)
§ 13-4-3 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utilities. Where alleys are not provided, easements of at least ten
feet wide centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities where
necessary. Easements for storm or sanitary sewers shall be at least 20 feet
wide. They shall have continuity of alignment from block to block. Temporary
construction easements may be required where installation depths are greater
than ten feet.
   (B)   Watercourses. When a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a storm water easement
or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such
watercourse.
(1974 Code, § 10-3-3) (Ord. 518, passed 3-25-1969)
§ 13-4-4 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Length. Block lengths shall not exceed 800 feet and shall not be less
than 400 feet.
   (B)   Pedestrianways. In blocks longer than 600 feet, a pedestrian crossway
with a minimum right-of-way of ten feet may be required near the center of the
block. The use of additional access ways to schools, parks and other
destinations may also be required.
(1974 Code, § 10-3-4) (Ord. 518, passed 3-25-1969)
§ 13-4-5 LOTS.
   (A)   Layout. Where possible, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot shall front on
a public street. Lots with a frontage on two parallel streets shall be avoided.
   (B)   Size and dimension. Minimum lot areas and lateral dimensions shall be
as set forth in the zoning regulations of the city.
   (C)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be platted at least 10% wider than the
minimum lot width required.
   (D)   Natural features. In the subdivision of land, due regard shall be
shown for all natural features which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
stability to the proposed development.
   (E)   Lots along thoroughfares. There shall be no direct vehicular access
from residential lots to arterial streets or highways and residential lots
shall be separated from railroad rights-of-way by a 25-foot buffer strip, which
may be in the form of added depth or width of lots backing on or siding on the
railroad right-of-way.
   (F)   Lot remnants. Lot remnants which are below the minimum lot size must
be added to adjacent or surrounding lots rather than be allowed to remain as an
unusable outlot or parcel unless the owner can show plans for the future use of
such remnant.
