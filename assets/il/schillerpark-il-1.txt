§ 10.20 ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF COSTS FOR EXTRAORDINARY COSTS FOR
EMERGENCY AND OTHER SERVICES.
   (A)   From time to time, Village departments that provide public safety,

health services encounter the need to hire or retain third parties in order to
provide certain emergency and other services, e.g. for plumbing work, removal
of vehicles, testing to determine life safety issues, the handling and/or
disposal of toxic substances or hazardous materials, or other services
necessitating the use of special equipment — all or some of which services may
generate the expenditure of money (herein "extraordinary costs") payable by the
Village to third parties (herein "provider") for such provider's rendering of
such emergency or other services. Whenever the Village incurs such
extraordinary costs, the Village shall be reimbursed the actual amount of such
extraordinary costs by the person (herein "recipient") receiving the benefit of
the services which generated the extraordinary costs.
      (1)   Upon receipt by the Village Manager/ Comptroller of a notification
that such extraordinary costs have been incurred by the Village, the Village
Manager/Comptroller shall cause a Village invoice to be issued to such
recipient along with a copy of the statement received from the provider of such
services.
      (2)   In the event the Village is not in receipt of payment within 30
days from the date of such invoice, the Village Manager/Comptroller is
authorized to undertake such action as provided by law as may be necessary for
the recovery of such extraordinary costs as well as the Village's attorneys'
fees and other costs associated with such recovery.
   (B)   As used herein the term "provider" shall not include any officer,
employee of the Village or family member of any officer or employee of the
Village rendering such extraordinary services.
(Ord. 05-2544, passed 11-8-05)

within the Village, and the Village opts out of any such regulations or
requirements, except those required by federal and state law or the Village.

that a member of any group associated with this unit of government which is
subject to the provisions of the Open Meetings Act (herein "Subject Group") may
attend and participate in any open or closed meeting of that Subject Group from
a remote location by way of telephone, video or internet connection, provided
that such attendance and participation is in compliance with this policy and
any other applicable state or local laws.
   (B)   Prerequisites. A member of the Subject Group of the Village of
Schiller Park shall be provided the opportunity to attend an open and closed
meeting or only one of such meetings from a remote location if the member meets
the following conditions and a majority of the members present of the Subject
Body votes to approve the remote attendance.

Subject Body at least twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting unless advance
notice is impractical.

family or other emergency; and

   (C)   Voting Procedures. After roll call, a vote for the Subject Body shall
be taken, considering the prerequisites set forth in the above mentioned
Section, (B)(2), on whether to allow an off-site board member to participate
remotely. All of the members physically present are permitted to vote on
whether remote participation will be allowed. A vote may be taken to permit
remote participation for a stated series of meetings if the same reason applies
to each case. Otherwise, a vote must be taken to allow each instance of remote
participation.
   (D)   Quorum and Vote Required. A quorum of physically present members must
be established at any meeting before it can be considered whether to allow a
member to participate in the meeting remotely. A vote of a majority of the
members present shall be necessary to decide the issue. For the meeting to
continue, there shall always need to be a quorum physically present.
   (E)   Minutes. The member participating remotely shall be considered an off-
site participant and counted as present by means of video or audio conference
for that meeting if the member is allowed to participate. The meeting minutes
of the Village of Schiller Park shall also reflect and state specifically
whether each member is physically present, present by video, or present by
audio means.
   (F)   Rights of Remote Member. The member permitted to participate remotely
will be able to express his or her comments during the meeting and participate
in the same capacity as those members physically present, subject to all
general meeting guidelines and procedures previously adopted and adhered to.
The remote member shall be heard, considered, and counted as to any vote taken.
Accordingly, the name of any remote member shall be called during any vote
taken, and his or her vote counted and recorded by the Clerk or secretary and
placed in the minutes for the corresponding meeting. A member participating
remotely may leave a meeting and return as in the case of any member, provided
the member attending electronically shall announce his or her leaving and
returning. A member participating remotely must be able to hear all of the
meeting clearly without interruption and the Subject Group and public must be
able to hear the member participating remotely.

must be physically present at any closed meeting. Members participating
remotely shall otherwise be entitled to participate in closed meetings by video
or audio conference as provided above.

of an Application. The Building Director shall be required to issue a
Determination within sixty (60) days after the submission of a completed
Application. Failure of the Building Director to issue a Determination on a
completed Application within said time frame shall be deemed to be a decision
denying the Application.
      (1)   If an applicant agrees with the Determination and, if applicable,
incorporates any suggested modifications to the Application, the Building
Official shall issue the Certificate.
      (2)   If an applicant objects to the Determination, the applicant shall
submit any objections in writing, along with the Application and Determination,
to the Village Manager for review (in this Section hereinafter referred to as
"Appeal"). The Village Manager shall set a date for a meeting regarding the
Appeal within 15 days after receipt of the Appeal. Following such meeting, the

electricity to resellers, the tax imposed under this subchapter shall be
collected from purchasers by the person maintaining a place of business in this

debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the
purchaser and is recoverable at the same time and in the same manner as the
original charge for delivering the electricity.
   (B)   Any tax required to be collected by this subchapter, and any tax in
fact collected, shall constitute a debt owed to the Village by the person
delivering the electricity, provided that the person delivering electricity
shall be allowed credit for such tax related to deliveries of electricity the
charges for which are written off as uncollectible, and provided further that,
if such charges are thereafter collected, the delivering supplier shall be
obligated to remit such tax.
   (C)   Persons delivering electricity shall collect the tax from the
purchaser by adding such tax to the gross charge for delivering the
electricity. Persons delivering electricity shall also be authorized to add to
such gross charge an amount equal to 3% of the tax they collect to reimburse
them for their expenses incurred in keeping records, billing customers,
preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the
Village upon request. For purposes of this subchapter, any partial payment of a

§ 36.055 REMITTANCE AND RETURNS.

      (2)   The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the
time of making that return, pay to the Village Treasurer the amount of tax
herein imposed; provided, in connection with any return the taxpayer may, if he
or she so elects, report and pay an amount based upon his or her total billings
of business subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made
(exclusive of any amounts previously billed).
   (B)   Returns for electricity.
      (1)   Every tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a

this subchapter.
      (2)   If the person delivering electricity fails to collect the tax from
the purchaser or is excused from collecting the tax under §
36.052, then the purchaser shall file a return in a form prescribed by the
Village Comptroller/Manager and pay the tax directly to the Village on or
before the last day of the month following the month during which the
electricity is used or consumed.

(Ord. 98-2127, passed 7-28-98)
§ 36.057 RESALES OF ELECTRICITY.
   (A)   Electricity that is delivered to a person in the Village shall be
considered to be for use and consumption by that person unless the person
receiving the electricity has an active resale number issued by the Village
Comptroller/Manager and furnishes that number to the person who delivers the
electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or
partially non-taxable as a sale for resale.
   (B)   If a person who receives electricity in the Village claims to be an
authorized reseller of electricity, that person shall apply to the Village
Comptroller/Manager for a resale number. The applicant shall state facts
showing why it is not liable for the tax imposed by this subchapter on any
purchases of electricity and shall furnish such additional information as the
Village Comptroller/Manager may reasonably require.
   (C)   Upon approval of the application, the Village Comptroller/Manager
shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify the number to
the applicant.
   (D)   The Village Comptroller/Manager may cancel the resale number of any
person if the person fails to pay any tax payable under this subchapter for
electricity used or consumed by the person, or if the number: (1) was obtained
through misrepresentation; or (2) is no longer necessary because the person has
discontinued making resales.

MOTOR FUEL TAX
§ 36.080 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEALER. Any person engaged in the business of selling motor fuel at retail
to a purchaser in the Village of Schiller Park for the purchaser's use or
consumption, and not for resale in any form. The location of the seller's
business does not determine whether it is a dealer, rather it is the location
of the sale. A seller is a dealer if the sale occurs 1) at the seller's
business in the Village of Schiller Park, or, 2) at the purchaser's premises in
the Village of Schiller Park.
   DISTRIBUTOR. Any person engaged in the business of selling motor fuel to a
dealer for resale. A person who typically acts as a distributor, but who sells
motor fuel to a purchaser for the purchaser's own use or consumption, and not
for resale in any form, is a dealer for that transaction and shall comply with
all of the responsibilities and obligations imposed on dealers by this
subchapter "Motor Fuel Tax" to Chapter 36 for that transaction.
   MOTOR FUEL. All volatile and inflammable liquids produced, blended or
compounded for the purpose of, or which are suitable or practicable for,
operating motor vehicles. MOTOR FUEL includes, without limitation, gasoline,
gasohol, diesel oil, motor benzol, motor benzene, propane gas fuel, kerosene
and special fuel as defined in the Illinois Motor Fuel Tax Law. (See ILCS Ch.
35, Act 505, § 1)
   PERSON. Any natural person, individual, trust, court-appointed
representative, syndicate, estate, firm, partnership, association, limited
liability company, club, company, business trust, institution, agency,
contractor, supplier, vendor, vendee, corporation, joint venture, joint-stock
company, receiver, trustee, conservator, legal representative, or any other
legally recognized entity not mentioned herein.
   PURCHASER. A person who purchases motor fuel for that person's use or
consumption, and not for resale in any form.
   RETAIL SALE. The sale of motor fuel for any good and valuable consideration
to a purchaser for use as a consumer and not for resale to another. A retail
sale of motor fuel occurs at the place where its transfer of ownership occurs
as evidenced by its transfer into a vehicle fuel tank or any other storage tank
owned by the purchaser.

§ 36.081 TAX IMPOSED.
    A tax is hereby imposed on the retail sale of motor fuel in the Village of
Schiller Park at the rate of eight cents ($0.08) per gallon from and after June
1, 2020. Such tax is to be paid by the purchaser, and nothing in this Chapter
36 shall be construed to impose the tax upon the occupation of selling motor
fuel. The ultimate incidence of and liability for payment of said tax shall be
borne by the purchaser. It shall be deemed a violation of this Chapter 36 for a
seller of motor fuel at retail to fail to add the tax imposed herein to the
sale price of motor fuel or to otherwise absorb such tax. It shall be the duty
of every dealer to secure the tax from the purchaser at the time the dealer
collects the purchase price for the motor fuel and to pay over the tax to the
Village Finance Department, as provided in this subchapter, "Motor Fuel Tax".
The tax shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and charges.

§ 36.082 REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.
   Dealers doing business on the effective date of this subchapter "Motor Fuel
Tax" to Chapter 36, and who have not already registered, shall register with
the Village Finance Director on forms provided by the Village within twenty
(20) calendar days after such effective date. A person becoming a dealer after
the adoption of this subchapter "Motor Fuel Tax" shall register with the
Finance Director within twenty (20) calendar days after commencement of
business. Purchasers required to pay the motor fuel tax directly to the Village
under § 36.083(A) shall register with the Finance Director by the 20th day of
the month following the retail sale of the motor fuel. Each dealer shall have
the duty to maintain complete and accurate books, records and accounts showing
the gross gallons of motor fuel sold at retail each day and the amount of motor
fuel taxes collected from or to be paid by purchasers thereof for each day.

§ 36.083 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (A)   The dealer shall have the duty to collect the tax imposed herein from
each purchaser. On the 20th day of each month, the dealer shall transmit a
report of sale of motor fuel in the previous month to the Finance Director on
such form and in the manner prescribed by the Finance Director. In the event
that the Illinois Department of Revenue establishes a filing date different
from the 20th of the month for the filing with it of the Retailers Occupation
Tax Return Form ST-1, after the effective date of this subchapter "Motor Fuel
Tax", then such different filing date shall apply herein. If the date is
different than the above- mentioned effective date, the Finance Department
shall notify all dealers. Each report of sale of motor fuel shall be
accompanied by a remittance of the appropriate amount of tax applicable to the
sale reported; provided, however, that the dealer may retain an amount of money
equal to one percent (1%) of the tax due as compensation for services rendered
in the collection and prompt payment of such tax by or before the payment due
date. Failure to remit the tax by the payment due date shall result in a loss
of eligibility for the foregoing compensation of one percent (1%) of the tax
due, and the dealer shall remit the full amount of the tax collected to the
Village without any such reduction. Payment of the tax imposed herein shall be
made to the Finance Director.
      (1)   Because the ultimate liability for payment of the Village motor
fuel tax falls on the purchaser, if any purchaser receives motor fuel for which
the motor fuel tax has not been collected by the dealer as required by this
"Motor Fuel Tax" subchapter, such purchaser shall pay the tax directly to the
Village in the same manner required of dealers in §
36.083(A) except that the purchaser shall not retain an amount of money equal
to one percent (l%) of the tax.
   (B)   Any officer, employee, partner, member or manager of any entity,
whether a dealer or a purchaser, which is an owner subject to the provisions of
this subchapter, that has the control, supervision or responsibility of
collecting tax proceeds, filing returns, and transmitting collected tax
proceeds of the tax imposed by this subchapter, and who fails to file such
return or transmit to the Village, any tax proceeds so collected, shall be
personally liable for any such amounts collected, including interests and
penalties thereon, if after proper proceedings for the collection of such
amounts such entity is unable to pay such amounts to the Village, and the
personal liability of such officer, employee, partner, member or manager, as
provided in this section, shall survive dissolution of the entity.
   (C)   Any payment that is returned because of insufficient funds may result
in the finance department requiring that all future payments be made either by
cashier's check or money order. The dealer shall be liable for any and all fees
and costs incurred by the Village for any payment that is returned because of
insufficient funds, and such fees and costs shall be in addition to any fine,
penalties or interest provided for by this Chapter or any other applicable
ordinance. In the event a payment is returned because of insufficient funds, it
shall be treated as if no payment was made, and the dealer shall be liable for
any and all applicable fines, penalties and interest.

§ 36.084 INSPECTION OF RECORDS.
   For the purposes of administering and enforcing this subchapter "Motor Fuel

inspect all books, records, and reports of all dealers as defined in this
subchapter, and all purchasers who may be liable for the motor fuel tax under §
36.083(A)(1). Such inspection shall take place only during normal business
hours of dealers as defined by this subchapter.

§ 36.085 LATE PAYMENT PENALTY.
   (A)   If any person, dealer or purchaser who is required under this
subchapter "Motor Fuel Tax" to file a tax return with the Village fails to file
the return and pay the tax when and as required by this subchapter, the
provisions of §
36.191(B) shall apply with respect to late filing, late payment and failure to
file penalties, and the provisions of §
36.191(A) shall apply with respect to interest to be assessed on a late
payment, underpayment, or nonpayment of the tax. The total of such late filing,
late payment, or failure to file penalties and interest shall be paid along
with the tax imposed hereby. The tax herein required to be collected by any
dealer or purchaser pursuant to this Chapter 36 and any tax in fact collected
by a dealer or purchaser shall be collected in trust for the Village and shall
constitute a debt owed by the dealer or purchaser to the Village. The Village
may bring a civil action to collect any unpaid tax, interest or penalty. Any
judgment entered in such civil action shall include the Village's reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of litigation.

taken against the person.

"Motor Fuel Tax", upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not
less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars
($750.00) and shall also be ordered to pay all of the costs and fees incurred
by the Village in prosecuting the violation, which shall include, but shall not
be limited to the costs of an administrative adjudicative proceeding or court
proceeding, the hearing officer and reasonable attorney's fees and costs. A
separate and distinct offense shall be regarded as committed for each day on
which a person shall continue any such violation.

   For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not

Local Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
Local Tax Administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer
filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax
due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior
to the filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the
date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure
application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for
any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer
incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is
liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid
tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the
taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The
payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to
by the Local Tax Administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a
result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this
Section must be paid within ninety (90) days after a final determination and
the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed
to by the Local Tax Administrator, whichever is longer.

§ 36.352 SURCHARGE IMPOSED.
   (A)   A streaming service surcharge of five percent (5%) of the charges paid

use of an electronic amusement.
   (C)   In the case of streaming services that are delivered electronically to
mobile devices, as in the case of video streaming, audio streaming and online
games, the rules set forth in the Illinois Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing
Conformity Act, 638 ILCS 35, as amended, may be utilized for the purpose of

amount of the streaming service surcharge imposed on each person, unless the
person or owner or operator provides otherwise with books, records, or other
documentary evidence, has been collected from the person by the owner or
operator.
   (C)   Every owner or operator who is required to collect the streaming
service surcharge shall be considered a tax collector for the Village. All
streaming service surcharges collected shall be held by such tax collector as

obligation to pay the surcharge.
   (D)   The streaming service surcharge shall be paid in addition to any and
all other taxes and charges.
(Ord. 21-4282, passed 7-1-21)

subject to the provisions of this Subchapter who has the control supervision or
responsibility of collecting the streaming service surcharge, filing returns
and transmitting the collected surcharge and who willfully fails to file such
return or to transmit any surcharge so collected to the Village shall be
personally liable for any such amounts collected, including interest and
penalties thereon, if after proper proceedings for the collection of such
amount, such entity is unable to pay such amounts to the Village, and the
personal liability of such officer or employee shall survive dissolution of the
entity. For purposes of this Subsection, an officer or employee willfully fails

intending not to perform any of the officer's or employee's obligations
hereunder, including but not limited to the utilizing of surcharge proceeds
collected for the Village to pay any other entity obligations.

reasonable notice inspect and examine the books and records of an owner or

enforcement of the collection of the surcharge. It is unlawful for any person
to prevent, hinder, or interfere with the Village Comptroller/Manager, or such
designee, in the discharge of the Village Comptroller/Manager's, or such
designee's, duties hereunder. It shall be the duty of every person required to
collect the surcharge to keep accurate and complete books and records,
containing all information necessary for the collection of the surcharge, to
which the Village Comptroller/Manager, or such designee, shall have full
access.
      (2)   In the event that the inspection and examination by the Village
Comptroller/Manager, or such designee, discloses a discrepancy in excess of
five percent (5%) from the information furnished by the person required to
collect the surcharge, the cost of said inspection and examination shall be
borne by said person.
   (E)   The Village is authorized to adopt, promulgate, and enforce any
additional rules and regulations pertaining to the interpretation, collection,
administration and enforcement of this Subchapter.

§ 37.01 CREATION AND PURPOSE.
   Section 1-2.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code (ILCS Ch. 65, Act 5, § 1-2.1-2)
allows home rule municipalities to provide by ordinance for a system of
administrative adjudication of municipal code violations to the extent
permitted by the Illinois Constitution. The Village is a home rule
municipality. The Illinois Constitution provides that a home rule unit may
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and
affairs (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(a)(1970)). The Illinois
Constitution further provides that the powers and functions of home rule units
shall be construed liberally.
   This section is established to provide a fair and efficient method of
enforcing the Village's regulations through administrative adjudication of
charges of non-vehicular violations of the New Millennium Code. All provisions
of the New Millennium Code may be enforced through the administrative
adjudication system, provided the system shall have no authority to impose a
penalty of incarceration or adjudicate an offense under the Illinois Motor
Vehicle Code which is a traffic regulation governing moving vehicles, or to
impose a fine in excess of $50,000.00. The Village reserves its right to employ
all other means and methods available under the law to enforce its New
Millennium Code, including direct application to the Courts.
(Ord. 10-2769, passed 4-13-10)
§ 37.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this section, and the interpretation and application
thereof, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have
the meanings given herein, unless the context in which they are used shall
indicate otherwise. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the
present tense include the future, words in the singular number include the
plural number and words in the plural number include the singular number. Words
or phrases not defined shall be given their common and ordinary meaning unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CODE. The New Millennium Code of the Village and the Illinois Vehicle Code
(ILCS Ch. 625, Act 5, §§ 1-100 et seq.) which is adopted by reference in §
70.020, except any offense under the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar offense
that is a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and any
reportable offense under § 6-204 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   VIOLATION. Any violation or infraction, of the Code or any ordinance of the
Village including, but not limited to, any building code, law or rule adopted
by reference. Violation notice is in form of citation or other charging
document.
   VILLAGE. The Village of Schiller Park, Cook County, Illinois.

imposed and collected by the municipality.
      (12)   Request that the Village prosecutor, corporation counsel, or other

   The Village officer or employee shall certify the correctness of the
information required by this subsection by signing his name to the Violation

   (C)   Service of Violation Notices. Service of Violation notices shall be

by:
      (1)   Handing a copy of the Violation notice to the respondent or, if

      (2)   Delivering a copy of the Violation notice to the person charged by
certified mail, return receipt. Such service shall be completed as of the date
of the deposit in the United States Mail.
      (3)   If a building Code Violation is alleged where the person charged is

the parties a full and fair opportunity to be heard.
   (B)   All administrative hearings shall be conducted on the date set for

of the Hearing Officer. The purpose of administrative hearings is to provide a

and the grant of, continuances shall be curtailed to the extent fairness
permits. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance.
   (C)   The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the
conduct of the administrative hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be
admitted only if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs. The Hearing Officer shall permit
persons to contest the merits of an alleged Violation subject to the
administrative adjudication procedures of this section without attending a
hearing.
   (D)   A violation shall be deemed prima facie true and correct and shall be
considered prima facie evidence of the facts alleged therein and shall be
deemed to state a claim and meet the requirements of this section, unless
specifically stated otherwise by the Hearing Officer.
   (E)   The record shall be preserved. Such preservation may be made by tape
recording or other appropriate means.
   (F)   Determination of Liability. Hearings shall result in a default
judgment, or a determination of liability or non-liability, made by the Hearing
Officer, who shall consider facts and/or testimony. The Hearing Officer shall,
upon a determination of liability, assess fines and penalties in accordance
with this section and issue a notice of final determination that shall contain,
at a minimum, the following information and warnings:

      (2)   A date by which the violation must be brought into compliance with
the Code, if applicable.
      (3)   A statement that the unpaid fine and any penalty assessed is a debt
due and owing the Village.
      (4)   A warning that the findings, decision and order of the Hearing
Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction. And in the case in which a respondent fails to comply
with a judgment ordering the correction of a code violation or imposing any
fine or other sanction as a result of the code violation, a statement that any
expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the judgment, including but not
limited to, attorneys' fees, court costs and costs related to property
demolition or foreclosure, shall be a debt due and owing the Village and may be
collected in accordance with applicable law.
   (G)   Default. A notice of judgment entered by default shall be forwarded to
any person who fails to appear and shall contain the same information as a
determination of liability stating that the judgment may be set aside by the
Hearing Officer if, within 14 days of issuance of the judgment, a petition is
received stating what the Hearing Officer determines is good cause for failure
to appear. The Hearing Officer, upon making a determination of good cause shall
provide the petitioner with notice of a new hearing date or denial of the
petition. The default judgment shall state that it shall constitute a final
determination of liability if such petition is not received, if the petition is
denied, or if after setting of a new hearing date the person fails to appear.
   (H)   Final Determination. The determination of liability shall constitute a
final determination for purposes of judicial review and shall be subject to
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law as set forth in ILCS Ch.
735, Act 5, §§ 3-101 et seq. of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, which
sections are incorporated herein by reference.

attorney, issue subpoenas for the production of records or directing witnesses
to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The party requesting a subpoena
shall serve, via first class mail, copies of any and all subpoenas on all
parties to the action. If, on the date set for hearing, the respondent, his or
her attorney or agent, fails to appear, the Hearing Officer may, after
determining that proper notice of hearing has given, find the respondent in
default and shall proceed with the hearing and accept evidence relevant to the
existence of a code violation.

result of a code violation, any expenses incurred by the Village to enforce the
judgment, including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, court costs, and
costs related to property demolition or foreclosure, after they are fixed by a
court of competent jurisdiction or by the Hearing Officer, shall be a debt due
and owing the Village and may be collected in accordance with applicable law.
      (1)   Prior to any expenses being fixed by the Hearing Officer pursuant
to this division, the Village shall provide notice to the person that states
that the person shall appear at a hearing before the Hearing Officer to
determine whether the person has failed to comply with the judgment. The notice
shall set the date for such hearing, which shall not be less than 7 days from
the date that notice is served. If notice is served by mail, the 7-day period
shall begin on the date the notice was deposited in the mail.
      (2)   Upon being recorded in the manner required by Article 12 of the
Code of Civil Procedure (ILCS Ch. 735, Act 5, §§ 12-101 et seq.) or by the
Uniform Commercial Code, a lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal
estate, or both, of the person in the amount of any debt due and owing the
Village under this section. The lien may be enforced in the same manner as a
judgment lien would be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (3)   Additionally, whenever any fine, charge, penalty, sanction or
payment is due pursuant to any provision of this Code and is not paid after the
Village sends, mails or otherwise delivers notice (unless a different period is
specifically stated elsewhere in this Code) to the person responsible for such
fine, charge, penalty, sanction or payment (the "responsible person"), the
Village may transfer such fine, charge, penalty, sanction or payment to a
collection agency of the Village's choosing. Any such collection agency shall,
for such purposes of collection of such fine, charge, penalty, sanction or
payment be deemed an agent of the Village. All costs incurred by the Village
for the collection of any fines, charges, penalties, sanctions or payments
transferred to any collection agency shall be assessed against the responsible
person as an additional fine, charge, penalty, sanction or payment, subject to
any applicable statutory limits.

§ 37.11 ELECTION OF REMEDIES.
   Nothing in this section shall preclude the Village from petitioning a court
of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate a violation or a violation which
provides the remedy of imprisonment, or from petitioning a court of competent
jurisdiction to impose the remedy of imprisonment for failure to comply with an
order of a Hearing Officer.
(Ord. 10-2769, passed 4-13-10)
§ 37.12 ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION PROCEDURES NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The adoption by the Village of a system of administrative adjudication does
not preclude the Village from using other methods to enforce code violations.
(Ord. 10-2769, passed 4-13-10)
§ 37.13 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this section shall be interpreted so as not to be in
conflict with the laws of the State or any other limitations imposed by law. In
the event, however, that any section, provision, sentence, or clause of this
section is declared unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, that
determination will not affect the other remaining provisions of this section.

(Ord. 22-4338, passed 12-21-22)
§ 38.02 POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTERING APPLICATIONS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS.
   (A)   Application for PSEBA benefits.
      (1)   The Village shall maintain a PSEBA benefit application form which
shall be the standard form required for a PSEBA benefit applicant (hereinafter

      (2)   The PSEBA benefit application form must be signed, sworn and
notarized to certify the truthfulness of the content of the information
contained in the completed application. The applicant shall also provide the
Village all documents and medical records submitted before the relevant pension
board in the disability pension proceedings, and worker's compensation records.
      (3)   The applicant must file a complete and executed PSEBA benefit
application no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the
governing safety pension board's granting of a line-of-duty disability pension
or within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the adoption of this

      (2)   The Village Manager shall make an initial determination in writing.
A copy of the Village Manager's determination shall be issued to the applicant,
within fifteen (15) calendar days after the submission of all documentation
relevant to the PSEBA benefit application.
      (3)   The Village Manager's initial determination shall include the
reasons for the decision and shall state that:
         (a)   The applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA; or
         (b)   A hearing as set forth in § 38.03 should be convened in order to
determine whether or not the applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA.
      (4)   If the Village Manager's initial determination refers the matter to
a hearing, the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing as set forth
in § 38.03, by submitting a written request for such hearing to the Village
Manager within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the Village Manager's
initial determination. Failure to timely submit said written request for a
hearing shall result in the forfeiture of benefits under PSEBA.
(Ord. 22-4338, passed 12-21-22)
§ 38.03 POLICY AND PROCEDURE FOR HEARINGS FOR PSEBA BENEFITS.
   If the Village Manager makes the determination that a hearing should be
convened or the applicant timely requests a hearing, the Village Manager shall
convene a hearing which shall be overseen by a Hearing Officer, appointed as
set forth in §
38.03(B), below, whose power and authority and limitations are as follows:
   (A)   Power of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall have all of
the powers granted to him or her under common law relative to the conduct of an
administrative hearing, including the power to:
      (1)   Preside over the administrative hearing;
      (2)   Administer oaths;
      (3)   Hear testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the issue of
eligibility under PSEBA;
      (4)   Issue subpoenas to secure attendance of witnesses and the
production of relevant papers or documents upon the request of the parties or
their representatives;
      (5)   Rule upon objections presented at the administrative hearing;
      (6)   Preserve and authenticate the record of the hearing and all
exhibits in evidence introduced at the hearing; and
      (7)   Issue a determination based on the evidence presented at the
hearing, the determination of which shall be in writing and shall include a
written finding of facts, decision and order.
   (B)   Hearing Officer. The Village President, with the advice and consent of
the Village Board, is authorized to appoint a Hearing Officer for each
administrative hearing held under this chapter. A Hearing Officer must be an
attorney who has been licensed to practice law in Illinois for at least three
(3) years. In making the appointment, the Village President must consider the
candidate's ability to perform the requirements of a Hearing Officer and his or
her knowledge and experience in administrative practice, the rules of evidence,
civil procedure, and laws concerning PSEBA and other benefits for public safety
employees.
   (C)   Administrative Hearing. An administrative hearing shall be held, under
the guidelines set forth below, to adjudicate and determine whether the
applicant is eligible for benefits under PSEBA. If the applicant is found
eligible, the benefits shall be consistent with PSEBA.
      (1)   Time and date. The Village shall notify the applicant of the
administrative hearing pursuant to a written notice served upon the applicant
via U.S. Mail, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing.
Such notice will indicate the date, time and place that the hearing will be
held, as established by the Village, along with the name and contact
information of the Hearing Officer who will preside at the hearing. If the
applicant cannot attend said hearing on the date or time as indicated in the
notice, the applicant must contact the Hearing Officer within seven (7)
business days of service of the notice to coordinate an alternative hearing
date. Failure to coordinate an alternative date or appear at the scheduled
hearing may result in the denial of PSEBA benefits.
      (2)   Record. All hearings shall be attended by a certified court
reporter who shall make a transcript of all proceedings.
      (3)   Procedures. The Village, by the Village Manager or his or her
designee, and the applicant shall be parties to the administrative proceedings
and each shall be entitled to representation by counsel at the administrative
hearing. Each party may present witnesses, may present testimony and documents,
may cross-examine opposing witnesses, and may request the issuance of subpoenas
to compel the appearance of relevant witnesses or the production of relevant
documents.
      (4)   Evidence. The rules of evidence as set forth in the Illinois Code
of Evidence shall apply to the extent practicable unless, by such application,
the Hearing Officer determines that application of the rule would be an
injustice or preclude the introduction of evidence of the type commonly relied
upon by a reasonably prudent person in the conduct of her or his affairs. Such
determination shall be in the sole discretion of the Hearing Officer.
      (5)   Determination. Within forty-five (45) calendar days from the
conclusion of the administrative hearing, the Hearing Officer shall issue a
determination of whether the petitioning applicant is eligible for benefits
under PSEBA. This determination shall be in writing, with a copy to the
applicant and the Village Manager, and shall include a written finding of
facts, decision and order. The determination by the Hearing Officer shall
constitute a final administrative determination for the purpose of judicial
review by either party under the common law writ of certiorari.
      (6)   Administrative records. All records pertaining to the
administrative process will be held within the office of the Village Clerk, in
a file in the public safety employee's name, separate from the employee's
personnel file.
(Ord. 22-4338, passed 12-21-22)
§ 38.04 OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS.
   (A)   Health insurance benefits payable from any other source will reduce
the benefits payable from the Village. Each applicant will be required to sign
an affidavit attesting to the fact that the applicant is not eligible for
insurance benefits from any other source.
   (B)   It is the responsibility of the benefit recipient to notify the
Village within thirty (30) calendar days of any changes to other sources of
health insurance benefits. Receipt of benefits in violation of this provision
will require reimbursement to the Village of any benefits received. The Village
reserves the right on an annual basis to have the benefit recipient provide
another affidavit affirming whether other health insurance is available or
payable to the applicant, applicant's spouse, or applicant's qualifying
dependent children.
   (C)   The applicant is also required to notify the Village when the
applicant becomes Medicare eligible so the Village can assist with the
transition to Medicare coverage and/or adjust health insurance benefits or
PSEBA benefits accordingly.

interested in such property after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall
be released by the Village or person in whose name the lien had been filed, and
the release may be filed of record as in the case of filing notice of lien. The
lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgages or
mechanics' liens. Suit to foreclose this lien shall be commenced within two
years after the date of filing notice of lien; however, the lien of the Village
shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate
have arisen subsequent to removal of the litter and prior to the filing of such
notice, and the lien of the Village shall not be valid as to any mortgagee,
judgment creditor, or other lien holder whose rights in and to such real estate
arise prior to the filing of such notice. Nothing hereinabove shall preclude
filing of a complaint with the court of proper jurisdiction for any violation
of this chapter and/or other remedies at law or in equity which may be
available to the Village for the enforcement of this municipal code.

waters, surface waters, storm waters and other drainage or clear waters.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to discharge or cause to be discharged, directly
or indirectly, into the sanitary sewer system of the Village any ground waters,
surface waters, storm waters or any other extraneous flows.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful to make a connection to or to maintain or operate
a connection which serves any home, building or any other establishment,
premises or facilities and which contributes, directly or indirectly, to the
sanitary sewer of the Village, any ground waters, surface waters, storm waters
or any other extraneous flows.
   (D)   All drains or connections designed or intended to receive and
discharge ground water, surface water, storm water and other drainage shall be
considered illegal connections if they discharge directly or indirectly into
the sanitary sewer system. The illegal connections include, but are not limited
to, roof drains, downspouts, footing drains, area-way drains, drain tiles (and
sump pumps used to collect and discharge the same), yard drains, catch basins
and inlets and the connections shall not be allowed to discharge directly or
indirectly into the sanitary sewers.
   (E)   The proper maintenance and operation of a building service sewer,
house connection or sanitary sewer line to the point of connection to the
municipal sanitary sewer system shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
premises served by the sanitary sewer pipes. Maintenance means keeping the
sanitary sewer connection, sewer lines or other sewer facilities or structures
in satisfactory working condition and good state of repair (including, but not
limited to, preventing any obstruction or extraneous materials or flows from
entering the facilities, protecting the facilities from any damage and keeping
the same free from defects or malfunctions) and making necessary provisions and
taking necessary precautions to assure the sewer facilities at all times are
capable of satisfactorily performing the services and adequately discharging
the functions and producing the final results and purposes the facilities are
intended to perform, discharge or produce.
   (F)   (1)   All downspouts or roof drains shall discharge onto the ground or
be connected to storm sewer, drainage ditches or a drainage system.
      (2)   Footing drains shall be connected to sump pumps and discharge shall
be made into storm sewers, drainage ditches or a drainage system.
      (3)   Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge ground waters or
other storm waters shall be connected to the storm sewer or discharge into a
drainage ditch or drainage system.
      (4)   Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge floor drain flow,
laundry tubs or other sanitary sewage shall be connected to the sanitary
sewers.
      (5)   A sump pump shall be used for one function only, either the
discharge of storm waters or the discharge of sanitary sewage.
   (G)   When a structure having water and sewer service is demolished, the
landowner is required to disconnect the water and sewer service at the primary
main and seal the opening thereof at the expense of the landowner.
   (H)   Because of their almost instantaneous impact, their injurious results,
substantial contributions and relative ease of correction, the Village will
institute a priority program for the elimination of extraneous flows entering
into the sanitary sewer system through downspouts, roof drains and other
visible or outside connections which are connected directly or indirectly to
the sanitary sewer system.
      (1)   Within a period of six months from the passage date of ordinance,
and at no expense to the property owner, the Village will make visual outside
inspections of all properties within the Village, with specific attention to
downspouts, roof drains and other visible or outside connections and, if
requested by the property owner, the Village will enter into the premises and
make or assist in the making of additional inspections of the premises to
ascertain if illegal connections are present. Upon completion of the visual
outside or inside inspection, the Village will advise the property owner in
writing if any illegal connections are observed and will advise on the manner
of corrections for compliance with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   After the corrections are made the Village, at no expense to the
owner, will make further inspections of the corrections to ensure compliance
with this section.
   (I)   Within 90 days after notice to the property owner by the Village of
the presence of illegal connections, the property owner, at his or her expense,
shall disconnect all illegal connections observed and all discharges of
extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer system, directly or indirectly, shall
be discontinued.
   (J)   In addition to visual inspections on the outside or inside of the
premises, as indicated in division (H) above, the Village may make other tests
and inspections of the municipal sewer systems as it deems necessary in order
to locate the illegal connections and sources of extraneous flows as may exist.
The Village, at its option, also may invoke other legal powers vested in it or
implied by the statutes for the protection of the health and welfare of the
public, or institute legal action as it deems necessary to discover and order
the disconnection of any illegal connections that may exist.

   (F)   The Village reserves the right to further limit or suspend the use of
water for the sprinkling or irrigation of lawns and gardens or for any other
special purposes when the Village President and Board of Trustees shall
determine that the public exigencies and emergencies require the action. If in
the opinion of the Village President of the Village or the Village Manager/
Comptroller public exigencies and emergencies so require, because of the
possibility that the water supply will not meet the demand, the Village
President of the Village or the Village Manager/Comptroller may unilaterally
declare and take the action he or she may deem necessary and appropriate prior
to the next regularly scheduled or specially scheduled meeting of the Village
President and Board of Trustees. At the next meeting of the President and Board
after the Village President's action, the emergency conservation action shall

§ 53.09 METERS; READING.
   (A)   Once a water meter is installed, the ordinary cost of routine
maintenance, repair and replacement shall be at the expense of the Village.
Whenever in the sole determination of the Director a water meter is worn,
obsolete or in a condition of disrepair so as to be unfit for its purpose, the
Director shall cause a new meter or parts thereof to be installed upon the
premises. Except for breakage or damage done to meters by the Village and/or
its agent, the customer upon whose premises any service is provided shall be
liable for any breakage or damage done to such meter howsoever caused,
including but not limited to damage done by tampering, freezing, hot water or
theft and the amount of the loss shall be a lien against the premises as though
such amount were for unpaid water service. Before issuance of a building permit
in case of new construction or any work by the customer which requires the
relocation or removal of an existing meter, the applicant for a building permit
shall pay all of the labor costs, fees and expenses for the water meter and its
installation, corporation cock, roundway, water supply valve, buffalo box,
service line and any and all other equipment or supplies associated with
connection to the AMR system. The fees to be charged for the water meters,
MXU's and connections shall be in an amount equal to the Village's cost
thereof, plus 10%. Installation in the premises where the meter is to be
located must occur as follows:
      (1)   No equipment, structure or other impediment to the efficiency of
the AMR other than the equipment associated with the AMR shall be installed
within 12 inches of the water meter. In addition:
         (a)   For those premises wherein an MXU is required to be installed,
the MXU shall be mounted as specified by the Director wherever necessary in
order that the Village or its agent may receive a proper radio signal.
      (2)   The Director will inspect or cause to be inspected all connections
and installations.
   (B)   The Director shall read or cause to be read every water meter in the
Village that is connected to a service pipe as often as is necessary in order
that the Finance Director may forward water and sewer bills to the customers in
accord with this Chapter.
      (1)   All water meters shall be read through the AMR system. If meter
reading is not available through the AMR system, the Village will obtain the
reading by entering the premises and visually reading the meter or through the
use of a touch pad device. If a visual reading is necessary, a fee of $75 per
reading will be charged. However, if a touch-pad reading is necessary, a fee of
$5 will be charged for each reading. At any reasonable hour, the Director or
his agent shall be afforded entry to the premises upon which the meter is
located for the purpose of causing an inspection of the meter and register on
the premises in order to verify that the AMR reading is consistent with the
inside register reading.
      (2)   At any reasonable hour, the Director or his agent shall be afforded
entry to the premises upon which the meter is located for the purpose of
changing the meter and/or the battery in the MXU, and/or providing other
maintenance as well as for the purpose of testing the accuracy of the meter.
The costs associated with such testing will be borne by the Village, however,
in the event the test reveals that the meter had been tampered with or damaged,
the costs of testing shall be added to the cost of replacement or repair and
paid the Village by the customer.
      (3)   In the event a meter and/or MXU fails to register the amount of
actual water service, until such time as the devices can be replaced or an
actual water meter reading can be obtained, the Finance Director shall estimate
the amount of water service for water and sewer billing purposes.
      (4)   In all cases, provided it is accurate, the meter will remain the
"meter of record" for recording the amount of water service. In the event the
meter fails to accurately measure the quantity of the flow of water through it,
the Finance Director shall prepare the billing statement pursuant to his
estimate based upon the quantities of past service to such premises.

for water service and sewer charges and forward same to the customer. The
customer shall pay such charges by the due date indicated upon the statement,
which shall not be less than 15 days following the date of mailing by the
Finance Director.
   (B)   In all instances, service is provided a customer through a service
pipe or hose coupling owned by a person other than the Village. Responsibility
for payment for service rests with the owner of such service pipe or hose
coupling, whether or not such owner is the customer. Accordingly, payment of
current and past due Village water billing is the responsibility of such owner.
      (1)   Whenever a final reading of a water meter and/or sewer meter is
requested of the Village or whenever the owner of a premises notifies the
Village that there is to be a change in occupancy of a given premises receiving
service, following such request, service shall be discontinued until the
account is paid in full. Service shall be resumed to such service pipe when the
owner thereof applies to the Village for service as provided in this chapter.
      (2)   In the event of a change of ownership of service pipe without a
request for final reading or in the event of change of occupancy without notice
to the Village, upon becoming aware of such change, the Finance Director shall
give the new owner or occupant, as the case may be, a twenty (20) day notice
before terminating service. Upon such notice, the new owner or occupant, as the
case may be, shall be required to apply to the Village for service as provided
in this Chapter.
   (C)   Whenever the Village Manager/Comptroller or Finance Director
determines that a given customer's water account is in arrears, he is
authorized hereby to enter into an agreement with such customer to avoid
termination of service.
      (1)   Such an agreement may create payment plans designed to allow such
customer to pay over time all past due amounts for service received. At a
minimum, such an agreement must provide that all bills for future service will
be paid in full on time and that the arrearage will be paid in full within no
more than two years. In the event a customer fails to abide by the terms of
such agreement, the Village Manager/Comptroller or Finance Director shall
terminate service following the second day after posting of notice of
termination on the premises where service is received and the mailing of
written notice of termination to such customer via first class United States
mail at such customer's billing address.
      (2)   If a customer agrees to pay the Village immediately all past due
amounts in full, the Village Manager/Comptroller or Finance Director is
authorized to waive outstanding late fees and penalties accrued on such
customer's account.

   (A)   In addition to all of the other remedies and/or penalties available to
the Village and/or accessed against the customer, such bill shall represent and
become a lien upon the real estate upon or to which such water or sewer service
is supplied. When a bill for water service remains unpaid 60 days after it has
been rendered, the Village Clerk shall file with the Cook County Recorder of
Deeds a notice of lien claim.
      (1)   This notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out a
description of such real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, the
amount of money due for such water or sewer service and the date when such
amount became delinquent.
      (2)   In addition to the foregoing, when a water and/or sewer bill
remains unpaid for a period of 45 days after it has been rendered and the
customer whose water bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the
Village Clerk has notice of this, the Village Clerk shall mail or cause to be
mailed notice of delinquency to the owner of the premises, if the owner's
address is known to the Clerk.
         (a)   Such notice shall also indicate that if such owner and/or
occupant has a complaint concerning an erroneous billing, within seven days
from the date of such notice such owner and/or occupant may contact the Village
Manager/ Comptroller and present such complaint to him, and that the Village
Manager/Comptroller may thereafter rectify any error he may find to exist.
         (b)   Such notice shall also contain a statement that service shall be
terminated and discontinued without further notice after ten days from the date
of such notice thereof unless the delinquency and/or violation is rectified.
Discontinued service shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled.
   (B)   The failure of the Village Clerk to record the lien claim or to mail
the notice or the failure of the owner to receive the notice shall not affect
the right of the Village to collect the arrearage and foreclose the lien for
unpaid water and sewer bills.
   (C)   The Corporation Counsel is hereby authorized and directed to institute
the proceedings in the name of the Village, in any court having jurisdiction,
to the amount of any bill for water and/or sewer which has remained unpaid 60
days after it has been rendered to the customer by the Village. He shall be
authorized to foreclose upon property subject to lien for unpaid water and/or
sewer charges including attorneys fees and court costs, as is the case in the
foreclosure of statutory liens.

§ 53.14 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR NON-PAYMENT OF BILL; FEE FOR
REINSTATEMENT OF SERVICES.
   Upon approval of the Village Manager/ Comptroller or Finance Director, the
water supply valve may be shut off, eliminating service to any premises for
which a bill remains unpaid 60 days after it is rendered. A fee of $50 will be
charged for the service of shutting off the Valve. In addition when an employee
of the Village is sent to the premise to shut off the valve an addition fee of
$50 will be charged whether or not the valve is actually shut off. When shut
off, the supply valve shall not be turned on except upon payment of all
arrearages to the Village including all shut off fees or an acceptable payment
arrangement is made by the Village Manager/ Comptroller or Finance Director.

saliva or other bodily substance is admissible, as provided hereinafter in this
subchapter, and the result of any such analysis shall give rise to the
following presumptions:
      (1)   If there was, at the time of the analysis, 0.05% or less by weight
of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be presumed the person was not under
the influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (2)   If there was, at the time of the analysis, in excess of 0.05% but
less than 0.10% by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, that fact shall not

of intoxicating liquor, but that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining whether the person was under the person was under the
influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (3)   If there was, at the time of the analysis, 0.10% or more by weight
of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be presumed the person was under the
influence of intoxicating liquor.
      (4)   Percent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams

consent of the person, as provided by state law, whose bodily substance was
analyzed.

limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the
question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of
intoxicating liquor.

all its branches, a registered nurse or other qualified person may withdraw
blood in a manner prescribed by the Department of Public Health for the purpose
of determining the alcoholic content therein.
   (F)   The person tested may have a physician authorized to practice medicine
in all its branches, a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse or other
qualified person of his or her own choosing to administer a chemical test, at
his or her own expense, in addition to any administered at the direction of a
law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test
by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test
taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
   (G)   Upon the request of the person who submitted to a chemical test at the
request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test must
be made available to him or his attorney.
   (H)   Evidence of a refusal to submit to a chemical test is inadmissible in
any civil action or proceeding or action under this section. Nothing in this
section shall prevent the admission of evidence of the refusal in a hearing on

VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION AND TOWING
§ 71.56 [RESERVED.]
§ 71.57 VEHICLE IMMOBILIZATION AND TOWING.
   (A)   Authorization. The Police Department of the Village is hereby
authorized to direct and supervise a program of vehicle immobilization for the
purpose of enforcing the parking regulations of the Village. Any police officer
of the Village is hereby authorized to cause the immobilization, by placement
of a restraint in such a manner as to prevent its operation, of any vehicle
parked upon any public street or way, or upon any other Village-owned property,
that is eligible for immobilization and that has been included on the vehicle
immobilization list pursuant to this Section. The Chief of Police may establish
such rules and procedures not inconsistent with the terms of this Section to
administer the Village's immobilization program.
   (B)   Eligibility for Immobilization. A vehicle shall be considered eligible
for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated
three or more citations, all of which are more than 30 days old, and for which
the fines and penalties have not been paid in full, issued against any vehicle
registered to such owner charging that such vehicle was in violation of the
Village's standing, parking, or compliance regulations. Every such vehicle
shall hereafter be referred to as an eligible vehicle. Any eligible vehicle
found upon any street or public place within the Village may be immobilized in
place by use of a mechanical device for such purpose. Such device may be called
a "boot", and the use of the same may be called "booting".
   (C)   Notice of Pending Immobilization. The Police Department shall cause a
notice of pending immobilization to be sent to the registered owner of any
eligible vehicle. The notice shall be sent certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the address of the registered owner of the eligible vehicle
recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State, or if the eligible vehicle bears
a registration number of a state other than Illinois, then at the address of
the registered owner recorded in that state's registry of motor vehicles. The
notice of pending immobilization shall provide the following information:
      (1)   A description of the vehicle, including the make, model, year, and
color of the eligible vehicle.
      (2)   The eligible vehicle's vehicle identification number, and the
number and state of the license plate displayed on the eligible vehicle.
      (3)   The name and address of the registered owner of the eligible
vehicle.
      (4)   The number and issue dates of the outstanding parking citations.
      (5)   A statement that the registered owner's vehicle is subject to
immobilization pursuant to this Section, unless the registered owner, within
ten days of receipt of the pending immobilization notice:
         (a)   Submits to the Police Department of the Village the full fine or
penalty amount due for each outstanding parking citation; or
         (b)   Requests a pre-immobilization hearing to contest the notice of
pending immobilization.
   (D)   Pre-Immobilization Hearing Procedures.
      (1)   Request for hearing. The registered owner of an eligible vehicle
may contest the validity of a notice of pending immobilization by delivering to
the Chief of Police within ten days after receipt of the notice of pending
immobilization a written request for a pre-immobilization hearing. If the
registered owner of an eligible vehicle does not request a pre-immobilization
hearing pursuant to this subsection within said ten day period, then the right
to a pre-immobilization hearing shall be deemed waived.
      (2)   Scheduling of hearing. The Chief of Police or his or her designee
shall schedule a pre-immobilization hearing within ten days after receipt of
the written request, and shall promptly notify the registered owner of the
eligible vehicle of the scheduled hearing date and time.
      (3)   Conduct of hearing. The pre-immobilization hearing may be conducted
either by the Chief of Police or by his or her designee. The registered owner
of the eligible vehicle must appear in person at the hearing and, to invalidate
the notice of pending immobilization, submit evidence that conclusively
demonstrates that the registered owner's vehicle is not an eligible vehicle.
Such evidence may include demonstration of any of the following:
         (a)   The registered owner was not the owner or lessee of the subject
vehicle on the date or dates that the parking citations were issued; or
         (b)   The fines or penalties for the parking citations identified in
the notice of pending immobilization have been paid in full; or
         (c)   The registered owner has not accumulated five or more
outstanding parking citations.
      (4)   Decision. Based on the evidence presented by the registered owner,
the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall issue a written decision
either:
         (a)   Affirming the validity of the notice of pending immobilization
and confirming that the subject vehicle is an eligible vehicle subject to
immobilization pursuant to this Section; or
         (b)   Revoking the notice of pending immobilization. A copy of the
written decision shall be delivered to the registered owner within 48 hours
after the conclusion of the pre-immobilization hearing. The decision of the
Chief of Police or his or her designee to affirm or revoke the notice of
pending immobilization shall be final.
      (5)   Action if affirmed. If the decision affirms the validity of the
pending immobilization notice, the decision shall be accompanied by a notice
that the registered owner has three days to pay, or cause to be paid, all
outstanding parking citation fines and penalties, and that failure to do so
will subject the registered owner's vehicle to immediate immobilization.
      (6)   No determination of violations. A pre-immobilization hearing shall
not be determinative of, and shall not be used or construed to adjudicate, any
of the individual parking violation citations on which the notice of pending
immobilization was based, or any other violation of any Village ordinance
relating to the eligible vehicle.
   (E)   Vehicle Immobilization List. The Chief of Police or his or her
designee shall create, keep, and maintain a vehicle immobilization list. The
Chief of Police or his or her designee shall place on the vehicle
immobilization list the vehicle registration number of all eligible vehicles
for which the registered owner has (i) failed to respond to a notice of pending
immobilization within ten days after receipt of such notice, or (ii) failed to
pay all outstanding parking citation-fines and penalties within three days
after receipt of the decision following a pre-immobilization hearing to affirm
the validity of a notice of pending immobilization. Any police officer may, in
a manner consistent with this Section, immediately immobilize any vehicle
included on the vehicle immobilization list without further notice.
   (F)   Immobilizing Restraint. When immobilizing an eligible vehicle pursuant
to the provisions of this Section, the Police Department shall use the "Denver
Boot" or other similar wheel locking restraint in such a manner as to prevent
operation of the vehicle. Every such vehicle so restrained shall hereafter be
referred to as an immobilized vehicle.
   (G)   Unauthorized Activities. It shall be unlawful for any person to
relocate or to tow any immobilized vehicle except in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. It shall also be unlawful for any person to damage
an immobilizing restraint, or to remove or attempt to remove an immobilizing
restraint without authorization. Any person who violates any provision of this
subsection (G) shall be:
      (1)   Subject to a fine of not less than $75 nor more than $500 for each
such violation; and
      (2)   Pay all costs to repair or replace the immobilization restraint
damaged or destroyed by such person.
   (H)   Upon immobilization of a vehicle, the police officer present shall
immediately cause to be placed upon such vehicle, in a conspicuous manner,
notice sufficient to warn any individual that such vehicle has been immobilized
and that any attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such
vehicle and/or the boot device.
   (I)   (Intentionally omitted.)
   (J)   Notice of Immobilization. A notice of immobilization shall be
immediately affixed to any eligible vehicle immobilized pursuant to this
Section. The notice of immobilization shall:
      (1)   State that the eligible vehicle is immobilized, and that any
attempt to move the immobilized vehicle may result in damage to the vehicle.
      (2)   State that the unauthorized removal of or damage to the
immobilizing restraint is prohibited, and punishable by a fine of not less than
$75 nor more than $500 for each such violation.
      (3)   Provide information on how the registered owner may secure release
of the immobilizing restraint.
      (4)   Provide information on how the registered owner may obtain a post-
immobilization hearing pursuant to this Section.
      (5)   State that if the registered owner fails, to secure release of the
immobilizing restraint or to request a post-immobilization hearing within 24
hours, the immobilizing restraint may be released by the Village and the
eligible vehicle may be towed and impounded.
   (K)   Release of Immobilizing Restraint. The registered owner of an
immobilized vehicle, or other person entitled to possession of such vehicle,
may secure the release of an immobilizing restraint by paying or causing to be
paid to the Police Department of the Village the following fees and penalties:
      (1)   Immobilization fees:
         (a)   First occurrence, $100;
         (b)   Second occurrence, $150;
         (c)   Third occurrence, $200;
         (d)   Fourth occurrence, $250;
         (e)   Fifth occurrence, $300;
         (f)   Sixth occurrence, $350;
         (g)   Seventh and each subsequent occurrence, $400;
      (2)   All parking citation fines and penalties issued against the
immobilized vehicle that remain outstanding, including specifically, but
without limitation, the parking citations identified in the notice of pending
immobilization.
      (3)   The Village Manager/Comptroller or his designee is authorized
hereby to enter into an agreement with the registered owner of such immobilized
vehicle to create payment plans designed to allow such registered owner to pay
over time all amounts due pursuant to subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this
subsection (K), or to waive amounts due pursuant to the Village's parking
enforcement actions as he determines is necessary to secure payment of the
maximum amount of penalties levied but in no event shall he waive more than 50%
of the amount of fines accrued.
   (L)   Towing and Impoundment of Immobilized Vehicle. If the registered owner
of the immobilized vehicle or other authorized person does not secure the
release of the immobilizing restraint or request a post-immobilization hearing
within 24 hours of the immobilization, the Police Department shall be
authorized to cause such vehicle to be towed and impounded. If a request for a
post-immobilization hearing is received within this time, the towing and
impounding of the immobilized vehicle shall be deferred pending the outcome of
the post-immobilization hearing. The provisions set forth in Chapter 90
regarding impounded vehicles parked illegally shall apply fully to all
immobilized vehicles impounded pursuant to this Section; provided, however,
that:
      (1)   In addition to the towing and storage charges imposed pursuant to
§§
90.05 and
90.08, the fees and penalties specified in subsection (K) of this Section shall
be paid before the owner or person entitled to possession of the impounded
vehicle shall be permitted to repossess or secure the release of such vehicle;
and
      (2)   Notification to be provided to the owner of the impounded vehicle
under this Section shall include a statement that the vehicle was impounded
pursuant to the provisions of this Section, and that the registered owner has a
right to appeal the immobilization, towing, and impoundment of such vehicle by
requesting a post-immobilization hearing.
   (M)   Post-Immobilization Hearing Procedures.
      (1)   Request for hearing. The registered owner of an immobilized or
impounded vehicle shall have the right to contest the validity of the
immobilization and any subsequent immobilization, towing, or storage fees, by
delivering a written request for a post-immobilization hearing to the Chief of
Police within five days after the immobilization of the vehicle. If the
registered owner of an immobilized or impounded vehicle does not request a
post- immobilization hearing pursuant to this subsection within said five day
period, then the right to a post-immobilization hearing shall be deemed waived.
      (2)   Scheduling of hearing. The Chief of Police or his or her designee
shall schedule a post-immobilization hearing within three days after receipt of
the written request, and shall promptly notify the registered owner of the
eligible vehicle of the scheduled hearing date and time.
      (3)   Conduct of hearing. The hearing may be conducted either by the
Chief of Police or by his or her designee. At the hearing, the registered owner
must appear in person and present evidence conclusively establishing that the
immobilization, towing, or impoundment of the registered owner's vehicle was
not authorized.
      (4)   Decision. Based on the hearing record, the Chief of Police or his
or her designee shall issue a written decision: (a) affirming, in whole or in
part, the validity of the immobilization, towing, or impoundment of the
registered owner's vehicle; or (b) invalidating, in whole or in part, the
immobilization, towing, or impoundment of the registered owner's vehicle. A
copy of the decision shall be delivered to the registered owner of the subject
vehicle within 48 hours after the close of the post-immobilization hearing. The
decision of the Chief of Police or his or her designee shall be final.
      (5)   Action if invalidation. If the decision is to invalidate the
immobilization, towing, or impoundment, the Chief of Police or his or her
designee shall immediately release the immobilizing restraint if the vehicle
has not yet been towed, or release the vehicle if impounded, and remove its
State registration number from the vehicle immobilization list.
      (6)   Action if affirmed. If the decision is to affirm the
immobilization, towing, or impoundment, the registered owner shall be so
informed. If the immobilized vehicle has not yet been towed, the registered
owner shall also be informed that the immobilization fee and all outstanding
parking citation fines and penalties must be paid in full within 24 hours after
receipt of the decision, and that failure to make such payment may result in
the immediate towing and impoundment of the registered owner's vehicle.
      (7)   No determination of violations. A post-immobilization hearing shall
not be determinative of, and shall not be used or construed to adjudicate, any
of the individual parking citations on which the immobilization, towing, or
impoundment was based, or any other violation of any Village ordinance relating
to the eligible vehicle.
   (N)   Removal from Vehicle Immobilization List. After payment in full of all
applicable fees, fines, and penalties specified in this Section, the State
registration number of the eligible vehicle shall be removed immediately from
the vehicle immobilization list.

CHAPTER 74: AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM
Section
   
74.01   Automated traffic law enforcement system
§ 74.01 AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.
   This chapter provides for an automated traffic law enforcement system, which
detects motor vehicles which fail to abide by traffic-control signals at
intersections under penalty of a fine, and a system of administrative
adjudication by which such detected infractions shall be resolved.
   This chapter shall apply only to an automated traffic law enforcement system
located at the following intersections within the Village: (1) Northbound River
Road at Irving Park Road and (2) Southbound River Road at Irving Park Road.
   It shall be a violation of this chapter for anyone to operate a vehicle in
disregard of a traffic control device or to turn right on a red light where it
is posted "No Turn on Red."
   (A)   Detection. As used in this chapter, "automated traffic law enforcement
system" means a device within the Village with one or more motor vehicle
sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded
images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a steady or flashing
red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle
Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-306. The automated traffic law enforcement system shall not
be used to enforce speed limit regulations. The recorded images produced by the
automated traffic law enforcement system, which consists of either 2 or more
photographs, 2 or more microphotographs, 2 or more electronic images or a video
recording showing the motor vehicle, shall capture and display images of the
vehicle allegedly violating traffic-control signals, together with the license
plate on such vehicle, and shall also show the time, date and location of the
violation.
   (B)   Signage. Any intersection equipped with an automated traffic law
enforcement system must have a sign posted which is visible to approaching
traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated
traffic law enforcement system.
   (C)   Notice of Violation. When the automated traffic law enforcement system
records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in spite of a steady or
flashing red signal indicating a violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-306, this shall be deemed a non-criminal violation
for which a civil penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) shall be assessed
and for which no points shall be assigned by the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code
Point System for License Suspension to the owner or driver of the vehicle. The
Village shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner
or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be mailed by first class mail within 30
days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the Village of the identity
of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90
days following the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor
vehicle, service of an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no
later than 210 days after the violation. Prior to service of a notice of
violation, the associated recorded image(s) shall be reviewed by a technician
employed or contracted by the Village to determine whether or not the motor
vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6 of the Illinois
Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-208.6, or this chapter. Each notice of violation
associated with an automated traffic law violation shall also require a review
of the associated recorded image by an officer or retired officer of the
Village police department empowered under this chapter to determine whether a
red light offense has occurred or whether one of the defenses enumerated below
in paragraph (E) is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that
the recorded image captures a violation of one of the foregoing provisions and
that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the
registered vehicle owner or the lessee of the vehicle in the manner provided
for below. The Traffic Compliance Administrator shall retain a copy of all
violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the
alleged violator. Each notice of violation, which shall constitute evidence of
the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging
a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall
establish prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis
of the defenses established in paragraph (E), shall include the following:
      (1)   the name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the
vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such
information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database;
      (2)   the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the
violation;
      (3)   the vehicle make, if available and readily discernible;
      (4)   the violation charged;
      (5)   the location where the violation occurred;
      (6)   the date and time of the violation;
      (7)   a copy of the recorded images;
      (8)   the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the
civil penalty should be paid if liability for the violation is not going to be
contested;
      (9)   a statement that the recorded images are evidence of a violation of
a red light signal;
      (10)   a warning that failure to either pay the civil penalty or contest
liability is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the
driving privileges of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle in addition
to the specified penalties for failing to contest liability or pay the fine in
advance of the hearing. Payment of the civil penalty or contesting of liability
must be done in writing within 30 days of the mailing of the notice of
violation or by attending the administrative hearing;
      (11)   the date, time and place of the administrative hearing at which
the charge may be contested on its merits, a date that shall be no less than 15
days from the mailing or other service of the first notice of violation;
      (12)   a statement that payment of the indicated fine and of any
applicable penalty for late payment shall constitute a final disposition of the
violation;
      (13)   the signature of the party reviewing the recorded images and
confirming that a violation took place;
      (14)   the identification number of the person issuing the notice; and
      (15)   a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the
person may view the recorded images of the violation.
   (D)   Penalty and Final Determination of Violation Liability.
      (1)   If the civil penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) referred to
in paragraph (C) herein is not timely paid or the notice of violation referred
to in paragraph (C) herein is not contested timely, a One Hundred Dollar
($100.00) penalty will be assessed in addition to the original One Hundred
Dollar ($100.00) fine by way of "Final Determination of Violation Liability".
      (2)   The Village, through its Treasurer, Clerk, Police Department,
Village Attorney, Administrative Adjudication Program, and/or any other
designated agent of the Village, may establish procedures for the collection of
the civil penalty imposed.
   (E)   Defenses. The following are the only defenses available for an alleged
violator contesting his or her liability for a violation, which shall be
weighed by the Hearing Officer and shall only rebut the prima facie case
established by the notice of liability insofar as one or more of the following
defenses are established by a preponderance of the evidence:
      (1)   the motor vehicle or registration plates were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control of or in the possession of
the owner at the time of the violation, which may be demonstrated through the
submission of a certified copy of a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle
or registration plates that was filed with a law enforcement agency prior to
the time of the alleged violation;
      (2)   the vehicle was an authorized emergency vehicle;
      (3)   the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection in spite
of a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or as
part of a funeral procession;
      (4)   the facts alleged in the notice of violation are inconsistent or do
not support a finding that a violation occurred;
      (5)   the operator of the vehicle received a Uniform Traffic citation
from a police officer at the time of the violation for the same incident as
captured by the automated traffic law enforcement system and either paid such
citation or successfully contested said citation;
      (6)   the vehicle was leased to another and within sixty (60) calendar
days after the citation was mailed to lessor, lessor submitted to the
municipality the correct name and address of the lessee of the vehicle
identified in the notice of violation at the time of the alleged violation,
together with a copy of the lease agreement, the lessee's driver's license
number and any additional information that may be needed; or,
      (7)   the respondent was not the registered vehicle owner, lessee or
renter of the cited vehicle at the time of violation.
   (F)   Administrative Adjudication. The Village shall utilize its system of
administrative adjudication for automated traffic law violations. The
administrative adjudication system for all violations of this chapter subject
to administrative adjudication shall be comprised of a Code Hearing Unit which
shall consist of a Hearing Officer and any other officials deemed necessary,
including a Traffic Compliance Administrator and any ordinances identified by
the Ordinances of the Village pertaining to such administrative hearing body.
Such officers shall be vested with the power, authority and limitations as are
hereinafter set forth.
   (G)   Powers of the Hearing Officer. The Hearing Officer shall have all of
the powers granted to Hearing Officers under 65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-4, the provisions
of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the power to preside
over all administrative hearings as the adjudicator, administer oaths, hear
testimony and accept evidence that is relevant to the existence of the Code
violation.
   (H)   Powers of the Traffic Compliance Administrator. The Traffic Compliance
Administrator shall have all of the powers granted by 625 ILCS 5/11-208.3(b)
(1), the provisions which are incorporated herein by reference.
   (I)   Establishment of Hearing Unit. The Village President is hereby
authorized to appoint necessary officers to establish the Code Hearing Unit and
to otherwise comply with the terms herein.
   (J)   Appointment of Traffic Compliance Administrator. The Village
President, with the advice and consent of the Village Board of Trustees, shall
appoint a Traffic Compliance Administrator, or a designee, who is authorized to
adopt, distribute and process parking, compliance and automated traffic law
violation notices, collect money paid as fines and penalties for the above
noted violations, operate an administrative adjudication system and make
certified reports to the Secretary of State regarding a registered vehicle
owner's failure to pay fines and penalties in accordance with 625 ILCS 5/6-
306.5. The Chief of Police, or his designee, shall act as the Traffic
Compliance Officer unless or until such position is filled by the President and
Board of Trustees.
   (K)   Service of Violation Notices. Violation Notices must be mailed to the
address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with
the Illinois Secretary of State within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of
State notifies the Village of the identity of the registered vehicle owner or
lessee of the vehicle, but no later than 90 days after the date of the
violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of
an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no later than 210 days
after the violation. If the notice of violation is returned as undeliverable,
then the notice of violation shall be sent to the last known address recorded
in a United States Post Office approved database.
   (L)   Adjudicative Hearing. The hearing shall be tape recorded, and the
Hearing Officer shall conduct the hearing in accordance with his or her powers
and duties, enumerated herein. Alleged violators who appear at the
administrative hearing to contest an alleged violation may be represented by
legal counsel at their own expense, however, formal and technical rules of
evidence shall not apply to the administrative hearing. The Hearing Officer
shall enter either a default judgment or a determination of liability or non-
liability in accordance with consideration of the facts and testimony, if any,
which shall constitute a final determination of liability from which an appeal
may be taken.
   (M)   Collection of Fines and Penalties. Nothing contained in this chapter
shall prevent the Village from pursuing all available remedies, allowed by law,
to collect fines and payment of penalties owed to the Village. The Village may
retain attorneys and private collection agents for the purpose of collecting
any default in payment of any fine or penalty or installment of that fine or
penalty. Any fees of costs incurred by the Village as a result of these
collection activities (including, but not limited to, attorneys, private
collection agents, or other authorized personnel) shall be assessed against the
violator. Said collection costs shall include an administrative fee of thirty-
five percent (35%) assessed on the default fine, penalty or outstanding
installment amount.
   (N)   Notice of Impending Driver's License Suspension. This notice shall be
sent via first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address
recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State of any person liable for any fine
or penalty due and owing the Village for five (5) or more unpaid automated
traffic law violations. If such mailing is returned as undeliverable, then the
Village shall send the notice to the last known address recorded in a United
States Post Office approved database. This notice shall state that failure to
pay the fine or penalty owing within forty-five (45) days of the notice's date
will result in the Village notifying the Illinois Secretary of State that the
person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under Section 6-
306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/6-306.5. The notice shall also
state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket
imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the
Village along with a request for the photostatic copy. If Village subsequently
makes a Certified Report to the Illinois Secretary of State, the subject
vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the Certified Report in writing. To
do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the Traffic Compliance Administrator a
written statement under oath, together with supporting documentation,
establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the
Certified Report: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the
subject vehicle or vehicles receiving five (5) or more automated traffic law
violations on the date or dates such violation notices were issued, or (2) that
the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five (5) or more
automated traffic law violations indicated on the Certified Report. Such
statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the Traffic Compliance
Administrator by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivered to
the Traffic Compliance Administrator within five (5) days after the person
receives notice from the Illinois Secretary of State that the person's driver's
license will be suspended at the end of a specified period of time unless the
Secretary is presented with a notice from the Village certifying that the fines
or penalties due and owing have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's
name on the Certified Report was in error.
   (O)   Final Determinations of Violation Liability. A final determination of
violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine or penalty
after a Hearing Officer's determination of violation liability and the
exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures
provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest
the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed
notice, the Hearing Officer's determination of violation liability shall become
final: (1) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or
(2) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing
having been made.
   (P)   Notice of Final Determination. This notice shall be sent following a
final determination of automated traffic law violation liability and the
conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under Section 11-208.3 of the
Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/11-208.3. The notice shall state that the
unpaid fine or penalty is a debt due and owing the Village. The notice shall
contain warnings that failure to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the
Village within the time specified may result in the Village's filing of a
petition in the Circuit Court to have the unpaid fine or penalty rendered a
judgment as provided by Section 11-208.3 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, or may
result in suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to pay fines
or penalties for 5 or more automated traffic law violations under Section 11-
208.6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
   (Q)   Petitions to Set Aside a Determination. A petition to set aside a
determination of automated traffic law violation liability may be filed by a
person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. The petition shall be filed with the
Traffic Compliance Administrator within fourteen days of the date of mailing of
the notice of final determination of liability. The grounds for the petition
are limited to: (1) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited
vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (2) the person having
already paid the fine or penalty for the violation in question, and (3)
excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. Upon
receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of liability, the
Hearing Officer shall review the petition to determine if just cause has been
shown to set aside the determination. If the Hearing Officer determines that
just cause exists to set aside the determination, the Village shall provide the
petitioner with a new hearing date for a hearing on the merits for that
violation. The Village shall notify the petitioner of the Hearing Officer's
decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within fourteen (14) business
days of the Village's receipt of the petition.
   (R)   Procedures for Non-Residents. Where the registered owner or lessee of
the cited vehicle is not a resident of the Village but seeks to contest the
merits of the alleged violation, such persons may contest the charges using the
same available defenses as stated above, and the same procedures - they may
attend the administrative hearing or they may submit any and all documentary
evidence no later than the hearing date referenced in the notice of violation,
together with a written statement reflecting that they are non-residents of the
Village.

§ 75.03 SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF VEHICLES.
   (A)   Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle
is being used in violation of §
75.02 he shall cause the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle to a facility
controlled by the Village or its agents. When the vehicle is towed, the police
officer shall notify any person identifying himself or herself as the owner of
the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the
time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the
seizure and of the vehicle owner's right to request a preliminary hearing as
provided in this Chapter.
   (B)   No vehicle shall be seized or impounded under this Chapter unless the
police officer determines that such action is necessary and reasonable under
the circumstances including but not limited to an individual who is present on
the scene, and who has permission from the owner of the vehicle to drive the
vehicle, and the individual is otherwise capable of lawfully operating a motor
vehicle in the State of Illinois, the police officer shall allow that
individual to remove the vehicle without being subject to seizure and
impoundment. Similarly, if the vehicle is parked legally, and/or will not
present a hazard to the public safety or otherwise jeopardize the efficient
movement of vehicular traffic at its location, the officer shall permit the
vehicle to remain at its location without being seized or impounded pursuant to
this Chapter. This determination shall not apply when the vehicle is required
to be seized or impounded due to investigative measures or when a vehicle is
seized or impounded pursuant to another lawful purpose.
   (C)   When a vehicle is not seized or impounded pursuant to this Section,
the owner shall not be required to post the requisite Five Hundred Dollar
($500.00) bond as referenced in §
75.04.
(Ord. 11-2813, passed 1-11-11)
§ 75.04 POSTING A BOND.
   If a bond in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) is posted with the
Village, the impounded vehicle will be released to the owner of record, upon
the payment by the owner of record of the towing and storage costs. If a
penalty is imposed for a violation of this Chapter, the bond will be forfeited
to the Village; provided, in the event that a violation of this Chapter is not
proven, the bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond
money posted pursuant to this Chapter will be held by the Village until the
hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until a
reviewing court issues a final decision.
(Ord. 11-2813, passed 1-11-11)
§ 75.05 PRELIMINARY HEARING ON IMPOUNDMENT.
   Where the owner of a vehicle seized under the provisions of this Chapter
requests a preliminary hearing within twelve (12) hours after the seizure of
the motor vehicle, the Chief of Police or designee must conduct a preliminary
hearing within twenty-four (24) hours after the request for the preliminary
hearing is received by the Village; provided that if the date for the hearing
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be
held on the next business day following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.
No preliminary hearing shall be required or granted to an owner whose vehicle
was not seized or impounded pursuant to this Chapter. For purposes of this
Section, the following shall apply:
   (A)   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the preliminary hearing.
   (B)   The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and
hearsay testimony will be allowed, and will be admissible.
   (C)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the Chief or designee
determines that there was probable cause to believe that the vehicle was being
used in violation of §
75.02, and further determines that the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle
was proper under §
75.03, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle unless the owner
of the vehicle posts a cash bond with the Village in the amount of Five Hundred
Dollars ($500.00). Posting of the bond shall not relieve the owner from paying
any applicable towing and storage costs associated with the seizure and
impoundment of the vehicle.
   (D)   If the Chief or designee determines that there was no probable cause
to believe a violation of §
75.02 occurred or otherwise determines that the vehicle should not have been
seized or impounded pursuant to §
75.03, the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record of the vehicle
without the posting of the bond and without the costs associated with the
seizure and impoundment of the vehicle. A determination that the vehicle should
not have been seized or impounded pursuant to §
75.03 has no bearing nor will relieve an owner of responsibility for violating
§
75.02 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 11-2813, passed 1-11-11)
§ 75.06 FINAL HEARING.
   (A)   Notice of Hearing. Any owner issued a citation for a violation of §
75.02 of this Chapter shall have the right to request a hearing to challenge
the citation and/or subsequent impoundment. Notice shall be given, to the owner
of record, of the ability to request a hearing. Such notice shall be mailed by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record, as shown on
the records of the Illinois Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail need

notice, in written form, of his ability to apply for a hearing under subsection
(B). If the owner of the vehicle requests a hearing pursuant to subsection (B),
the Village, within forty-five (45) days, shall notify the owner of record of
the date, time and location of a hearing. Notice of the date, time and location
of the hearing shall be sent via regular mail.
   (B)   Requesting a Hearing. Any person cited under this Chapter may apply
for a hearing when they believe that they or the person driving the vehicle was
not in violation of this Chapter at the time the citation was issued and/or
they otherwise believe that the impoundment of the vehicle was improper under
the circumstances. The application for a hearing shall be made no later than
seven (7) days after notice has been given either personally or by certified
mail, whichever is applicable in the given circumstance. The application to
request a hearing shall be provided by the Village at the time notice is given.
The bond will be forfeited in the event a hearing is not requested as provided
for in this ordinance.
   (C)   Hearing. For purposes of this Section, the following shall apply to
the owners hearing:
      (1)   Unless continued by order of the hearing officer, the hearing shall
be held within sixty (60) days after the motor vehicle was seized.
      (2)   All interested persons will be given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard at the final hearing.
      (3)   If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in
violation of §
75.02, and otherwise determines that the seizure and impoundment of the vehicle
was proper pursuant to §
75.03, the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle
until the owner of the vehicle pays to the Village a penalty in the amount of
Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus the towing and storage costs. In the event
the vehicle was not impounded, an order shall be entered wherein the owner of
record shall be liable to the Village in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars
($500.00). The penalty and costs shall be a debt due and owing to the Village.
      (4)   If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing
officer shall enter an order of default in favor of the Village, which order
shall require the payment to the Village of an administrative penalty of Five
Hundred Dollars ($500.00).
      (5)   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was not used as
hereinabove provided in violation of §
75.02 the motor vehicle will be returned to the owner of record of the vehicle
without any penalty or other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously been
posted, the cash bond shall be returned.
      (6)   If the hearing officer determines that the vehicle was used in
violation of §
75.02, but determines that the vehicle was not properly subject to seizure or
impoundment under §
75.03, the hearing officer shall enter a judgment against the owner in the
amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and release the seized vehicle without
towing and storage costs and/or order the reimbursement of towing and storage
costs if the vehicle was previously released. The penalty shall be a debt due
and owing to the Village.
      (7)   The ticket issued shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
offense stated was committed.
(Ord. 11-2813, passed 1-11-11)
§ 75.07 UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.
   (A)   Any motor vehicle that is not claimed within thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the time in which the owner of record may seek judicial
review of the action of the Village under this Chapter, or the time at which a
final judgment is rendered in favor of the Village by a Court, or the time at
which a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record
who is in default, may be disposed of as an abandoned or unclaimed vehicle, as
otherwise provided by law.
   (B)   If the penalty and towing and storage costs are not paid within eighty
(80) days after a penalty is imposed pursuant to this Chapter, the vehicle
shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be disposed of in the manner provided
by law for the disposition of abandoned or unclaimed vehicles, unless a
petition for judicial review is filed with a court of proper jurisdiction.
Where a petition for judicial review of the hearing officer's determination is
filed and pending in a court of proper jurisdiction, the vehicle shall not be
deemed to be abandoned and shall not be sold. If the petition for judicial
review is resolved in favor of the Village, the vehicle shall be deemed
abandoned and may be disposed of by the Village if the penalty and towing and
storage costs are not paid within thirty (30) days after the date of the
Court's order.
(Ord. 11-2813, passed 1-11-11)
§ 75.08 LIABILITY FOR PENALTY AND COSTS.

(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.148 ACTION ON PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   Village Engineer Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit
applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
Village Manager and the Village Engineer within a reasonable time after filing.
If the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Manager shall
reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the
Village Manager is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this Division and applicable ordinances, codes, laws, rules,
and regulations, the Village Manager shall issue a permit therefor as soon as
practicable. In all instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to
demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this Division.
   (B)   Additional Village Engineer Review of Applications of
Telecommunications Retailers.
      (1)   Pursuant to the Telephone Company Act, ILCS Ch. 220, Act 65, § 4, a
tele-communications retailer shall notify the Village Manager that it intends
to commence work governed by this Division for facilities for the provision of
telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village Engineer not less than ten (10) days prior to the
commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days
prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation. The Village Engineer
shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the facility may be
placed, used and constructed.
      (2)   In the event that the Village Engineer fails to provide such
specification of location to the telecommunications retailer within either (i)
ten (10) days after service of notice to the Village Manager by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving excavation for
new construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days after service of notice by the
telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving excavation for new
construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence work without
obtaining a permit under this Division.
      (3)   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village Engineer,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to this Division the
telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village Manager an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation available
regarding the facility to be constructed. Such application shall be subject to
the requirements of subsection (A) of this section.
   (C)   Additional Village Manager Review of Applications of Holders of State
Authorization Under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007. Applications
by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization under the Cable
and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted forty-five (45) days
after submission to the Village Manager, unless otherwise acted upon by the
Village Manager, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.149 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A
permit issued by the Village Manager in accordance with this Article authorizes
a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this
Division on Village-owned land and/or rights-of-way, and does not create a
property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights
of others who may have an interest in such land and/or the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Duration. No permit issued under this Division shall be valid for a
period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within
that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
   (C)   Pre-construction Meeting Required. No construction shall begin
pursuant to a permit issued under this Division prior to attendance by the
permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any
work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction
meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village
Engineer with such other Village representatives in attendance as the Village
Manager deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the
work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the
areas where work will occur, including but not limited to presence or absence
of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to
avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Compliance with All Laws Required. The issuance of a permit by the
Village Manager does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules,
and regulations.
   (E)   Notice Before Commencement of Construction. A minimum of twenty-four
(24) hours prior written notice must be given to the Village Engineer before
any work shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Division.
   (F)   Copy of Permit at Site Location. A copy of the issued permit shall be
kept at the work site at all times.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.150 REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS.
   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village Manager and the
Village Engineer within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted
work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the
locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the
permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of
this Division, it shall be treated as a request for deviation in accordance
with §
96.164. If the Village Manager denies the request for a deviation, then the
permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the
facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans
therefor.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.151 INSURANCE.
   (A)   Required Coverages and Limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise,
license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or
constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the
following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured
and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials,
agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in
paragraphs (1) and (2) below:
      (1)   Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-
operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to
as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with
limits not less than:
         (a)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury or death to
each person;
         (b)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property damage resulting
from any one (1) accident; and
         (c)   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other types of
liability;
      (2)   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired vehicles with a
combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for personal injury
and property damage for each accident;
      (3)   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and
      (4)   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than one
million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident. If the utility is
not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors
performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with
this section.
   (B)   Excess or Umbrella Policies. The coverages required by this section
may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a
following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy
exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy
becomes effective to cover such loss.
   (C)   Copies Required. The utility shall provide copies of all of the
policies required by this section to the Village Manager within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village Manager.
   (D)   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages. The insurance policies
required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor
the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by
the Village Manager, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent
to cancel or not to renew."
Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village Manager of said notice, and
in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the Village Manager evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
   (E)   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the
insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (A) of this
section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such
self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional
insureds under subsection (A) or the requirements of subsections (B), (C) and
(D) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village Manager evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to
self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
subsection (A) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private
self-insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.
   (F)   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability. The
legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of the
matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.
   (G)   Insurance Companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section
shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers
legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois.
All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better
and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.152 INDEMNIFICATION.
   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility shall
be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected
and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and representatives
harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims, demands, judgments,
damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of
suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or alleged to arise out of or
result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions, failures to
act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or
occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in providing or offering service over the
facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or
prohibited by this Division or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement;
provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses
arising out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this
Division by the Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or
representatives.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.153 SECURITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a form and
in an amount as set forth in this section. The Security Fund shall be
continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole
cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit.
The Security Fund shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements
of this Division;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations,
orders, permits and other directives of the Village Manager and the Village
Engineer issued pursuant to this Division; and
      (3)   The payment by the permittee of all liens and all damages, claims,
costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
non-performance by the permittee in violation of this Division including but
not limited to any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee
is required by this Division to perform that the Village must perform itself or
have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or
complete, and all other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to
this Division or any other applicable law.
   (B)   Form. The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in
the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form
acceptable to the Corporation Counsel, or an unconditional letter of credit in
a form acceptable to the Corporation Counsel. Any surety bond or letter of
credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
      (1)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the
Village Manager and the permittee;
      (2)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by
the Village of any amounts covered by it; and
      (3)   Provide a location convenient to the Village Manager and within the
State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
   (C)   Amount. The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to
provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at
least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the
permit, as determined by the Village Engineer, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the Village Manager estimates are likely to be
incurred by or on behalf of the Village if the permittee fails to perform such
restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit
will be performed in phases in multiple locations within the corporate limits
of the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one
(1) location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another
phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in
the previous phase or phases, the Village Manager may, in the exercise of sound
discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall
be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of
the Security Fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount
that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (C) for
any single phase.
   (D)   Withdrawals. The Village Manager, upon fourteen (14) days' advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for
such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made
if the permittee:
      (1)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee
hereunder;
      (2)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and
unpaid;
      (3)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or
expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by the permittee; or
      (4)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Division that the
Village Manager determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in
the Security Fund.
   (E)   Replenishment. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written
notice from the Village Manager that an amount has been withdrawn from the
Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount
specified in subsection (C) of this section.
   (F)   Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued
on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village,
upon written request for said return to the Village Manager, provided that any
such return of interest does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum
balance required in subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)   Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work
authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of
the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a
reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate
the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this
Division or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit,
the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the
property of the Village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said revocation, provided
that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to
the permittee.
   (H)   Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the Village with respect to
the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether
reserved by this Division or otherwise authorized by law, and no action,
proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect
any other right the Village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any
of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.154 PERMIT SUSPENSION AND REVOCATION.
   (A)   Village Right to Revoke Permit. The Village Manager may revoke or
suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Division for one (1) or more of the
following reasons:

permittee shall have the following options:
      (1)   Immediately provide the Village Manager and the Village Engineer
with evidence that no cause exists for the revocation or suspension;
      (2)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer,
the deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written proof of such
correction to the Village Engineer within five (5) working days after receipt
of the written notice of revocation; or
      (3)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over, above, along,
upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way
to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer providing written proof of such
removal to the Village Manager and the Village Engineer within ten (10) days
after receipt of the written notice of revocation.
   (D)   Stop Work Order. In addition to the issuance of a notice of revocation
or suspension, the Village Engineer may issue a stop work order immediately
upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth within subsection
(A) of this section.
   (E)   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply. If the permittee fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection (C) of this section, the Village
Engineer or his designee may, at the option of the Village Manager: (1) correct
the deficiencies; (2) upon not less than twenty (20) days notice to the
permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or (3) after not less
than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of failure to cure the non-
compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village. The permittee
shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of removal.

   (A)   Notification of Change. A utility shall notify the Village Manager no
less than thirty (30) days prior to the transfer of ownership of any facility

of-way.
   (C)   Insurance and Bonding. All required insurance coverage or bonding must
be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer and submitted to
the Village Manager in accordance with §
96.151.
(Ord. 07-2651, passed 11-13-07)
§ 96.156 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.

to any other permit required under this Division.
      (1)   Application for tree trimming permit. Applications for tree
trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by
competent workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
      (2)   Damage to Trees. Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation of
the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village Engineer may
require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning
would leave them in an unacceptable condition.
   (C)   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance. The Village Engineer
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees
of special significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles,
side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.

dwelling during the license year to determine the condition of each multiple
family building and single-family rental dwelling located within the Village

§ 98.15 VIOLATIONS; SUSPENSIONS AND REVOCATION OF OPERATING LICENSE.
   (A)   Whenever, upon inspection of the licensed multiple family building or
single-family rental dwelling, it is determined that conditions or practices
exist which are in violation of the provisions of this subchapter or any
applicable ordinance, code, or regulation of the Village, the Building Official
shall serve the owner with a notice of violation. Such notice shall identify
the specific violations and state that unless they are corrected within the
time specified in the notice, the owner shall be cited and its operating
license may be suspended. Notice pursuant to this section may be sent by United
States certified mail or hand delivered to the party designated in the
application to receive notices and process.
   (B)   The Village shall conduct a re-inspection of the multiple family
building or single-family rental dwelling at least every 45 days, unless
otherwise specified by the Building Official, until all violations cited have
been corrected. At the end of the time allowed for the correction of any
violation cited, the multiple family building or a single- family rental
dwelling shall be re-inspected by the Village. If it is determined that the
conditions have not been corrected, the Village may issue a notice of intent to
suspend the operating license. Violations caused by tenants should not be
considered grounds for suspension of an operating license as long as the
licensee cooperates in gaining compliance with applicable Village ordinances.
   (C)   Notice of intent to suspend shall be served upon the licensee together
with the date, time and place of a hearing to determine whether a license shall
be suspended. Such notice shall include a description or summary of the
violations and shall be served upon the licensee in person or by certified mail
not less than 72 hours prior to the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by
the Village Comptroller/Manager. Although the rules of evidence shall not apply
at the hearing, the licensee shall have the right to be heard concerning the
violations and present reasons why the license should not be suspended.
      (1)   Following such hearing, the Village Comptroller/Manager shall enter
an order or decision regarding the suspension of the operating license.
      (2)   Any person whose operating license to operate a multiple family
building or single-family rental dwelling has been suspended shall be given the
opportunity to be heard by the Village President in connection with the
violations. Said person must submit his or her request to be heard in writing
and the written request must explain in detail, the violations cited, why they
have not been corrected, and a compliance time frame for completion.
         (a)   However, if no written request for hearing reaches the Village
President within 21 days following the issuance of the order of suspension, the
operating license shall be revoked.
         (b)   In the event of a written request of hearing before the Village
President, the rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing regarding the
suspension of the operating license. As a result of such hearing, the Village
President may grant additional time for compliance with the applicable order or
may revoke the operating license. Prior to revocation any person whose
operating license has been suspended may request a reinspection upon a showing
that the violation or violations cited in the notice have been corrected.
   (D)   If, upon re-inspection, it is determined by the Village that the
violations cited in the notice have been corrected, the operating license shall
be reinstated by the Comptroller/Village Manager.
   (E)   If the licensee is convicted by a court of a violation of any
provision of this subchapter or any applicable ordinance, code, or regulation
in connection with the licensed multiple family building or single-family
rental dwelling, then the operating license shall be subject to revocation.
   (F)   In the event a condition of clear and present danger to health or
safety is found to exist, the Comptroller/Village Manager may immediately
revoke the operating license.
   (G)   Each day a multiple family building or a single- family rental
dwelling continues to operate after an operating license has been revoked shall
constitute a separate violation of this subchapter.
   (H)   The first re- inspection, referenced in division (B) above and each
additional re-inspection, thereafter, shall be done and billed in accordance
with the current fee schedule adopted by the Village, by resolution, which is
subject to change from time to time at the discretion of the Village with the
best interests of the Village in mind. Failure to pay a re-inspection fee
within the time period specified in an invoice shall constitute a separate
violation of this subchapter.

single-family rental dwelling, or dwelling unit fails, neglects, or refuses to
make repairs or other corrective action called for by a second order or notice
of violation issued pursuant to §
98.15, the Building Official may undertake such repairs or action, when in his
judgment a failure to make them will endanger the public health, safety, or
welfare, and the cost of such repairs and action will not exceed 50% of the
fair market value of the structure to be repaired.

family rental dwelling, or dwelling unit who has received notice of the
intention of the Building Official to make repairs or take other corrective
action shall give entry and free access to the Building Official for the
purpose of making such repairs upon reasonable notice. Any owner, operator, or
agent of a multiple family building, single-family rental dwelling, or dwelling
unit, who refuses, impedes, interferes with, hinders, or obstructs entry by
such agent pursuant to a notice of intention to make repairs or take other
corrective action shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000
for each such failure to comply with this section.
   (C)   When repairs are made or other corrective action taken at the
direction of the Building Official, the cost of such repairs and corrective
action shall constitute a debt in favor of the Village against the owner of the
repaired structure. In the event such owner fails, neglects, or refuses to pay
the Village the amount of this debt, it shall be recoverable in a civil action
against the owner or his successor, brought in a court of competent
jurisdiction by the Village which shall possess all rights of a private
creditor.

unsafe, or unsanitary dwelling or dwelling unit within the requisite time, the
Building Official may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a
demolition order to undertake the demolition. The court may grant such order
when no reconsideration or hearing on the matter is pending. The cost of such
demolition shall create a debt in favor of the Village against such owner, and
shall be recoverable in a civil action brought by the Village which shall
possess all the rights of a private creditor.
   (D)   Whenever a multiple family building or single-family rental dwelling
is demolished, whether carried out by the owner or by the Building Official,
such demolition shall include the removal of footings, foundation walls, and
concrete slabs; the filling in of excavation remaining on the property on which
the demolished dwelling was located; and grading and grass seeding, in such
manner as to eliminate all potential danger to the public health, safety, or
welfare arising from such excavation.
   (E)   All demolition shall be preceded by an inspection of the premises by
the Building Official to determine whether or not extermination procedures are
necessary. If the premises are found to be infested, appropriate rat
extermination to prevent the spread of rats to adjoining or other areas shall

CRIME FREE HOUSING PROGRAM
§ 98.40 CRIME FREE HOUSING PROGRAM.
   Crime Free Housing Program Seminar. Any owner of property, which property is
being rented out for residential purposes shall attend and complete a Village
of Schiller Park Crime Free Housing Program Seminar ("Seminar"). The owner,
agent, or designee of a new rental unit shall attend the Seminar prior to
obtaining or being issued a new Village Rental Dwelling License. Any owner of
property, which property is being rented out for residential purposes that does
not complete the Seminar will be fined, daily, until compliance is met in
accordance with this Chapter. The following are terms, conditions and
requirements by and for any owner of rental property:
   (A)   A property manager shall be considered an agent of the owner. If a new
property manager is hired, the new property manager shall have three (3) months
after hiring to attend the Village of Schiller Park's Crime Free Housing
Program Seminar.
   (B)   In addition to attending the Village Crime Free Housing Seminar, all
owners, agents or designees shall attend a refresher seminar once every three
(3) years to be compliant with this Ordinance prior to the expiration of a
license for that particular year or be fined daily thereafter in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (C)   The Crime Free Housing Coordinator, as designated by the Chief of
Police, shall provide the Finance Director and Community Development Department
with a list of owners, agents and/or designees who have attended the Seminar,
with the date of attendance and verification that the owner, agent or designee
has complied with the Ordinance and is eligible to obtain, maintain or renew
the rental dwelling license.
   (D)   Any owner, agent or designee of residential rental property is
required to utilize a crime free lease addendum or have a clause in the lease
similar to a crime free lease addendum for any leases executed. At the Seminar,
the Crime Free Housing Coordinator shall provide, at no cost, samples of the
crime free lease addendum and shall review any clauses within actual leases
with the Village's Legal Department to determine if the clause is similar to
the crime free lease addendum. The clause is to make criminal activity (not
limited to violent criminal activity or drug related criminal activity engaged
by, facilitated by or permitted by the renter, member of the household, guest
or other party under the control of the renter) a lease violation. The landlord
shall have authority under that clause to initiate an eviction proceeding as
specified in the Illinois Compiled Statutes Forcible Entry and Detainer
statutes. Proof of criminal violation shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence. An arrest, considered alone, is not enough evidence to begin the
eviction process of a tenant.
   (E)   Nuisance Residential Rental Property. It is hereby declared a nuisance
and to be declared against the health, peace and comfort of the Village for any
property owner, agent, or manager to allow or permit the following:
      (1)   Rental of a residential unit or residential building within an
apartment community or governed by a homeowner's association to a tenant who
allows any of the following offenses to occur relating to the tenant, member of
the tenant's household, guest, or other party under control of the tenant, to
occur: murder, kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping, prostitution, solicitation of
prostitution, pandering, obscenity, child pornography, harmful materials, sale
of obscene publication, criminal housing management, possession of explosives,

      (2)   Rental of a residential unit, or residential building within an
apartment community or governed by a homeowner's association to a tenant who
allows any of the following offenses to occur relating to the tenant, member of
the tenant's household, guest or other party under control of the tenant to
occur: commission of four (4) or more Village ordinance violations in a six (6)
month period that are not considered parking or compliance tickets by the
Village of Schiller Park Police Department.
   (F)   The Village may seek to enforce this Ordinance by seeking any and all
remedies under this Chapter, including the imposition of fines. In addition,
the Crime Free Housing Coordinator may suspend and/or recommend revocation of
any license issued hereunder if it appears to his satisfaction from the report
of any Village officer or Village employee making an inspection, or any other
available information that the licensee is violating this law or ordinance or
any law or ordinance, or is in violation of the nuisance section or is
operating in a manner not conducive to the public health, morals or safety. Any
suspension of a license pursuant to this Section may be appealed directly to
the Mayor and Village Board of Trustees within 15 days of rendering his
decision by the Crime Free Housing Coordinator. In the event the Crime Free
Housing Coordinator determines that revocation of the license is appropriate,
he shall so forward his recommendation to the Mayor and Village Board of
Trustees for their review and determination.
   (G)   Every owner, agent or designee shall require the tenant to supply them
with a list of people who will live in the rental dwelling; said list will be
turned over to the Crime Free Housing Coordinator and Community Development
Department.

Rental Requirements Agreement for Owners/Agents of Rental Housing, which may be
amended from time to time as is appropriate.

   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this title is to safeguard the natural
resources of the Village and to promote environmental values while protecting
the public health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Village
by providing for the regulations of the planting, maintenance, and removal of
trees within the Village.
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of the corporate authorities that this title
be construed so as to promote the preservation and care of trees. The corporate
authorities declare that trees are a natural, public resource, and an integral
part of the critical infrastructure of the Village and as such are highly
valued and must be preserved, protected, and cared for as other critical
infrastructure in the Village. The corporate authorities understand the
importance of trees within the Village and find that trees absorb pollution
from the air; sequester carbon dioxide; absorb and filter pollution from
stormwater run-off; produce oxygen; reduce flooding; stabilize soils and reduce
erosion: cool the surrounding area helping to reduce impacts due to heat
islands; reduce energy consumption by shielding structures from harsh winds and
sun; provide a buffer and screen against noise, light and pollution; improve
property values; provide important habitat for birds and other wildlife; and
protect and enhance the quality of life of all residents.

Penalty, see § 10.99
§ 110.61 PERSONS UNDER AGE.
   (A)   No licensee nor any officer, associate, member, representative, agent,
or employee of such licensee shall sell, give, or deliver alcoholic liquor to
any person under the age of 21 years; or to any intoxicated person or to any
person known by him or her to be under legal disability or in need of mental
treatment. No person, after purchasing or otherwise obtaining alcoholic liquor,
shall sell, give, or deliver such alcoholic liquor to another person under the
age of 21 years except as provided in division (B)(3) of this section. Whoever
violates the provisions of this division (A) is guilty of a misdemeanor.
      (1)   For the purpose of preventing the violation of this section, any
licensee, or his agent or employee, may refuse to sell or serve alcoholic
beverages to any person who is unable to produce adequate written evidence of
identity and of the fact that he or she is over the age of 21 years.
      (2)   Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a
document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or
subdivision or agency thereof, including but not limited to a motor vehicle
operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the federal
Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the
armed forces. Proof that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent,
demanded, was shown and reasonably relied upon such written evidence in any
transaction forbidden by this section is competent evidence and may be
considered in any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license
based thereon.
      (3)   Any person who sells, gives, or furnishes to any person under the
age of 21 years any false or fraudulent written, printed or photostatic
evidence of the age and identity of such person or who sells, gives or

identification of any other person shall be deemed to be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
      (4)   Any person under the age of 21 years who presents or offers to any
licensee, his agent or employee, any written, printed or photostatic evidence
of age and identity which is false, fraudulent, or not actually his own for the

or attempting to procure the serving of any alcoholic beverage, or who has in
his possession any false or fraudulent written, printed, or photostatic
evidence of age and identity, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
      (5)   Any person under the age of 21 years who has any alcoholic beverage
in his possession on any street or highway or in any public place or in any
place open to the public is guilty of a misdemeanor. This section does not
apply to possession by a person under the age of 21 years making a delivery of
an alcoholic beverage in pursuance of the order of his or her parent or in
pursuance of his or her employment. A licensee may employ a person 18 years of
age or older as a waiter or waitress, primarily for the service of food in a
licensed premise. However, it shall be unlawful for any such person under 21
years of age to draw, pour, and or mix alcoholic liquor as an employee of any
licensee.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to whom the sale, gift, or
delivery of any alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of age to purchase,
accept a gift of such alcoholic liquor, or have such alcoholic liquor in his
possession.
      (1)   If a licensee or his agents or employees believe or has reason to
believe that a sale or delivery of any alcoholic liquor is prohibited because
of the nonage of the prospective recipient, he shall, before making such sale
or delivery, demand presentation of some form of positive identification
referenced in division (A) above, containing proof of age, issued by a public
officer in the performance of his official duties.
      (2)   No person shall transfer, alter, or deface such an identification
card; use the identification card of another; carry or use false information;
or otherwise misrepresent his age for the purpose of purchasing or obtaining
alcoholic liquor or beverage in any tavern or other place in the Village where
such alcoholic liquor or beverage is sold. No person shall purchase, accept
delivery, or have possession of alcoholic liquor in violation of this division
(B)(2). The consumption of alcoholic liquor by any person under 21 years of age
is forbidden. Whoever violates the provisions of this section shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor.
      (3)   The possession, dispensing, or consumption by a person under 21
years of age of alcoholic liquor in the performance of a religious service or
ceremony, or the consumption by a person under 21 years of age under the direct
supervision and approval of the parents or parent or those persons standing in
loco parentis of such person under 21 years of age in the privacy of a home, is
not prohibited by this chapter.
   (C)   In every tavern or other place in the Village where alcoholic liquor
is sold there shall be displayed at all times in a prominent place a printed
card which shall be supplied by the Local Liquor Control Commission and which
shall read substantially as follows:
“WARNING TO MINORS
You are subject to a fine of up to $1,000.00 under the ordinance of the Village
of Schiller Park if you purchase any alcoholic liquor or misrepresent your age
for the purpose of purchasing or obtaining any alcoholic liquor.”

agent, or employee of such licensee, shall permit or allow a person under the
age of 21 years to enter or remain within a Lounge or the Lounge portion of a

guardian(s) or is an employee of said Lounge. It shall be unlawful for any
person under the age of 21 years to enter or remain within a Lounge or the
Lounge portion of a licensed premises unless such person is accompanied by

thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such transfer. For the purpose of

in such inquiry.

violation of this Chapter or the Franchise Agreement, the Village may act to
remedy the violation in accordance with the procedures set forth in a Franchise
Agreement and below:
   (A)   Notice of Violations.  Written notice shall be given to a Grantee
setting forth the nature of the violation and a reasonable period of time for a
Grantee to correct the violation. Unless the Village determines that the
violation is of such a nature that a lesser period of time is warranted for
remedying the violation, a Grantee shall be given thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to remedy the violation.
   (B)   Answer to Notice of Violations. Within thirty (30) days, or such other
period of time specified by the Village in its notice to a Grantee, a Grantee
shall respond in writing to the Village:
      (1)   That it contests the Village's notice of violation and requests an
opportunity to be heard as provided herein. A Grantee shall submit supporting
documentation with its response to the notice;
      (2)   That it contests the Village's notice of violation for the reasons
that the violation was beyond the reasonable control of a Grantee and requests
an opportunity to be heard as provided herein. A Grantee shall submit
supporting documentation with its response to the notice;
      (3)   That a Grantee will remedy the violation within the time specified
by the Village in its notice to a Grantee; or
      (4)   If a Grantee contends that an extended period of time is reasonably
needed to remedy the violation, it shall submit a written request for an
extension, together with supporting documentation that a Grantee cannot
reasonably remedy the violation within the time period specified by the Village
in its notice to a Grantee. The Village shall not unreasonably deny an
extension of time to remedy the violation. If the Village grants the extension,
a Grantee shall proceed to remedy the violation within the extended time
prescribed, provided that a Grantee also informs the Village on a regular basis
of the steps being taken to remedy the violation.
   (C)   Hearing. The Village shall give a Grantee not less than fourteen (14)
days written notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing to be
held before the Corporate Authorities. At the public hearing, the Corporate
Authorities shall hear and determine the issues and render its findings and its
decision. If a hearing officer has been appointed by the Village, the hearing
officer shall hear the relevant evidence and shall render a record of the
administrative hearing and recommended findings and decision to the Corporate
Authorities.
   (D)   Determination. If the Grantee fails to submit a written response to
the Village's notice of violation as provided in Paragraph (B) hereinabove, or
if a Grantee fails to remedy the violation within the time period specified by
the Village in its notice to a Grantee, or any extensions thereto granted by
the Village, or if the Corporate Authorities are persuaded after a hearing that
a Grantee has committed a violation as provided herein, the Corporate
Authorities may, after giving a Grantee an opportunity to be heard:
      (1)   Order a Grantee to remedy the violation within a reasonable period
of time specified by the Corporate Authorities;
      (2)   Assess liquidated damages against a Grantee in accordance with the
Franchise Agreement; or
      (3)   Impose any lesser sanction permitted by a Franchise Agreement.
   (E)   Judicial Relief Not Barred. No provision of this Section shall be
deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the Franchising Authority to seek
or obtain judicial relief to enforce the provisions of this Cable
Communications Ordinance.

   (B)   The Regulatory Authority and/or Food Sanitarian shall be permitted to
examine the records of the establishment to obtain information pertaining to
food and supplies purchased, received or used and persons employed.
   (C)   If any person denies the Regulatory Authority or the Food Sanitarian
access to a food establishment for the purpose of making an inspection, such a
denial shall be considered a violation of this chapter and grounds for
suspension or revocation of the establishment's Food Purveyor License. In
addition, the Regulatory Authority may institute appropriate legal action in
the Circuit Court to obtain an order authorizing access to the establishment
for the purpose of making an inspection.

§ 116.017 INSPECTION RECORDS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Upon completion of inspection at a food establishment, the
Regulatory Authority shall record the findings on an inspection report form
substantially similar to the food establishment inspection report required by
the Illinois Food Service Sanitation Code and shall furnish a copy of that
report with the findings recorded thereon to the license holder or person in
charge. The license holder or person in charge shall sign a copy of the report
to acknowledge receipt.
         (a)   The inspection report form shall summarize the sanitary
requirements of this chapter and shall set forth the grading criteria used to
determine whether the establishment passes or fails the inspection.
Inspectional remarks shall be written to reference, by section number, the
section of this chapter, the Illinois Food Service Sanitation Code, or any
regulations or standards incorporated by reference in the Illinois Food Service
Sanitation Code violated and shall state the correction to be made.
         (b)    The most recent inspection report shall not be defaced or
removed by any person except the Regulatory Authority. The original inspection
report shall be retained in the Regulatory Authority files.
      (2)   The completed inspection report is a public document and shall be
made available for public disclosure to any person who requests it according to
law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any information that is considered to be a
trade secret under applicable law, shall be treated as confidential by the
Regulatory Authority and, in accordance with applicable law, shall not be
subject to disclosure.
   (B)   Rating Score. Food establishments shall maintain a sanitation level
that will result in a pass rating.
   (C)   Correction of Violations. The completed inspection report shall
specify a period of time for the correction of the violations found, and
correction of the violations shall be accomplished within the period specified,
in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   If an imminent health hazard exists, such as a complete lack of
refrigeration, fire, flood, extended interruption of electrical or water
service, misuse of poisonous or toxic materials, onset of an apparent foodborne
illness outbreak, gross insanitary occurrence or condition, sewage backup into
the establishment, or other circumstances that may endanger public health, the
establishment shall immediately cease all food preparation, service or delivery
operations. However, an establishment need not cease operations in an area of
the establishment that is unaffected by the imminent health hazard. If
operations are ceased under this subsection or otherwise according to law,
operations shall not be resumed until authorized by the Regulatory Authority.
      (2)   Unless otherwise provided in the inspection report, the license
holder shall initiate corrective action on all identified violations within
forty-eight (48) hours after the time of the inspection. One (1) or more
reinspections will be conducted at times and on dates scheduled by the
Regulatory Authority to assure correction. After determining that the license
holder has corrected an identified violation, the Regulatory Authority shall
document such information on an inspection report and shall enter the report in
the Regulatory Authority's records.
      (3)   In the case of temporary food establishments, all violations shall
be corrected at the time of the inspection. If violations are not corrected at
the time of the inspection, the Regulatory Authority may, at its discretion,
order the temporary food establishment to immediately cease food service
operation until authorized to resume by the Regulatory Authority. In the
alternative, if violations are not corrected at the time of the inspection, the
Regulatory Authority may provide the temporary food establishment with a
specific period of time to correct the violations; if the violations are not
corrected within said period of time, the temporary food establishment shall
immediately cease food service operation until authorized to resume by the
Regulatory Authority.

Ord. 23-4361, passed 5-18- 23)
§ 116.018 EXAMINATION AND CONDEMNATION OF FOOD.
   (A)   Food may be examined, tested, or sampled by the Regulatory Authority
as often as may be necessary to determine freedom from adulteration or
misbranding and compliance with this chapter. It shall be the duty of any
person operating a vending machine, upon demand, to furnish to the Regulatory
Authority for its inspection samples of all of the food and drink being offered
for sale by means of the vending machine, which samples may be analyzed and a
record of that analysis shall be made and kept in the business office of the
Village for inspection of the public.
   (B)   The Regulatory Authority may, upon written notice to the owner or
person in charge, place a hold order on any food which it determines or has
probable cause to believe to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated,
misbranded, contaminated with foreign matter, or otherwise in violation of the
rules and regulations of the Illinois Food Service Sanitation Code or this
chapter. The Regulatory Authority shall tag, label or otherwise identify any
food subject to the hold order. The hold order shall state that a written
request for hearing may be filed with the Regulatory Authority within ten days
of the date of the order and that if a hearing is not timely requested, the
food may be ordered to be destroyed.
      (1)   Under a hold order, food may be permitted to be suitably stored in
an area of the food establishment if the food is protected from subsequent
deterioration and the storage does not restrict operations of the establishment
or present a risk to the public health.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for any person to remove or alter a hold
notice or tag placed on food by the Regulatory Authority and neither that food
nor the containers thereof shall be used, served, moved from the establishment,
relabeled, repacked, reprocessed, altered, disposed of or destroyed without
permission of the Regulatory Authority, except on order by a court of competent
jurisdiction. If the Regulatory Authority has reasonable cause to believe that
the hold order will be violated, or finds that the order is violated, the
Regulatory Authority may remove the food that is subject to the order to a
place of safekeeping pending the outcome of the procedures set forth in
subsections (3) and (4) below.
      (3)   After the owner or person in charge has had a hearing, or on the
basis of its examination in the event a written request for a hearing is not
received within ten days, the Regulatory Authority may vacate the hold order,
or may, by written order, direct the owner or person in charge of the food
which was placed under the hold order to denature or destroy the food or to
bring it into compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   The order of the Regulatory Authority to denature or destroy the
food or bring it into compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be
stayed if the order is appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction within
three (3) days.

§ 116.019 APPROVAL OF CONSTRUCTION PLANS.
   (A)   When a food establishment is constructed, altered, or remodeled or
when an existing structure is converted for use as a food establishment, four
(4) copies of properly prepared plans and specifications for construction,
remodeling, alteration, or conversion, showing the proposed layout; the
arrangement and construction material of work areas; the location, size and
type of fixed equipment and facilities; the intended menu; the anticipated
volume of food to be stored, prepared, and sold or served; mechanical plans;
the schedule for completing the construction, alteration, remodeling, or
conversion; and the name and model number of equipment shall be submitted to
the Regulatory Authority for review and approval before the construction,
altering, remodeling, or conversion is begun. All newly constructed or
remodeled food establishments, including mobile food establishments, shall
conform in their construction to the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   All equipment installed pursuant to this chapter shall be listed by
the National Sanitation Foundation in the annual listing of Food Service
Equipment or meet equivalent standards. The Regulatory Authority shall review
the plans and if they conform to the sanitation and construction equivalents of
this code, it shall approve them and return one (1) copy thereof with its
approval written thereon. The Regulatory Authority shall retain the other
copies for its files and records.
   (C)   If the Regulatory Authority finds the plans do not conform to the
sanitation and construction requirements of this code of ordinances, it shall
provide a plan review letter that notes the plans' deficiencies to the person
that submitted the plans by regular mail or electronic transmission. Upon
receipt of said plan review letter, the recipient may submit revised plans to
the Regulatory Authority for review and approval.
   (D) When plans and specifications have been approved by the Regulatory
Authority, it shall cause to have made the inspections as may be necessary
before the start of operations to determine compliance with the approved plans
and specifications and with the requirements of this code of ordinances.

conditional employee shall report the information within twenty-four (24) hours
and in a manner that allows the person in charge to reduce the risk of
foodborne disease transmission, including providing necessary additional
information such as the date of onset of symptoms and an illness, or onset of a

employee meets the criteria specified in subsection (G).
   (E)   The person in charge shall ensure that an employee who exhibits or
reports a symptom, or who reports a diagnosed illness, is excluded or
restricted as required by the Control of Communicable Diseases Code, Part 690
of Title 77 of the Illinois Administrative Code.
   (F)   An employee or conditional employee shall report to the person in
charge the information required by Section 750.500(a) of the Illinois Food
Service Sanitation Code.
   (G)   An employee shall:
      (1)   Comply with an exclusion issued under the Control of Communicable
Diseases Code and not work in any food establishment while complying.
      (2)   Comply with a restriction issued under the Control of Communicable
Diseases Code.

§ 119.015 DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSE OR PERMIT; PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Denial of Initial License.
      (1)   The Village Manager/Comptroller may deny an application for the
issuance of an initial license contemplated under this subchapter if it is
determined by a preponderance of the evidence that one or more of the following
findings is true:
         (a)   The applicant has failed to provide the information reasonably
necessary for issuance of the license or the applicant's application contains
any false, fraudulent, misrepresented or misleading statement;
         (b)   The applicant has made any false, fraudulent, misrepresented or
misleading statement, or has been convicted of perpetuating a fraud upon any
person, whether or not such fraud was perpetuated in the course of conducting
any business in the Village; or that the applicant has committed a felony;
         (c)   The applicant has failed to comply with all conditions
prerequisite to the issuance of the license, whether imposed by the Village or
by state statute;
         (d)   The applicant has failed to pay, or is in arrears in the payment
of, any debt, fee, fine, penalty, judgment, tax or charge due and owing to the
Village;
         (e)   The applicant has been denied a license by the Village to
conduct or operate the business described in the license application within the
preceding twelve (12) months, or the applicant's license to conduct or operate
the business described in the license application has been revoked within the
preceding twelve (12) months;
         (f)   The applicant or the premises or building(s) to be used for the
conduct or operation of the business have not been approved in accordance with
the inspection or investigation undertaken by the Village pursuant to §
119.005;
         (g)   The license fee required by this subchapter has not been paid;
or
         (h)   The applicant is in violation of, or is not in compliance with,
one (1) or more of the provisions of the Code.
      (2)   An applicant for a license shall cooperate fully with all village
officers or employees engaged in the license application process. The
applicant's refusal to give any information reasonably relevant to the
investigation of the application; to allow the premises used for or in
connection with the conduct or operation of the business to be inspected; to
appear at any reasonable time and place for examination under oath regarding
the application; or to otherwise cooperate with the investigation and
inspection required by the Code shall constitute an admission by the applicant
that the applicant is ineligible for a license and shall be grounds for the
Village Manager/Comptroller to deny the application for the license.
      (3)   In the event that the Village Manager/ Comptroller determines that
an applicant is not eligible for an initial license, the applicant shall be
given notice, in writing, of the reasons for the denial within thirty (30) days
of the Village's receipt of the completed application or the completion of the
inspection process, whichever is sooner, provided that the applicant may
request, in writing, at any time before the notice is issued, that such period
be extended for an additional period of not more than ten (10) days in order to
make modifications necessary to comply with the Code.
      (4)   An applicant may appeal the decision of the Village Manager/
Comptroller regarding a denial to the Corporate Authorities by filing a written
notice of appeal with the Village Manager/Comptroller within ten (10) days
after service of notice upon the applicant of the Village Manager/Comptroller's
decision. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a memorandum or other
writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in
support thereof. The Village Manager/Comptroller may, within fifteen (15) days
of service upon him or her of the applicant's memorandum, submit a responsive
memorandum to the Corporate Authorities. The Corporate Authorities shall
thereupon set the time and place for the hearing on such appeal, and notice of
such hearing shall be personally served upon or sent by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the applicant at his or her last known address at least
five (5) business days prior to the date set for the hearing. No oral testimony
shall be presented to the Corporate Authorities at the appeal, and the review
of the Corporate Authorities shall be limited to the memoranda submitted by the
Village Manager/ Comptroller and the applicant. After reviewing such memoranda,
as well as the Village Manager/ Comptroller's written decision, the Corporate
Authorities shall vote either to uphold or overrule the Village Manager/
Comptroller's decision. Such vote shall be taken within thirty (30) days after
the date on which the Village Manager/Comptroller receives the notice of
appeal. The decision of the Corporate Authorities on the appeal shall be by a
vote of a majority of the trustees then holding office and shall be final.
   (B)   Suspension of Business Operation. When the conduct or operation of any
business shall constitute a nuisance in fact or a clear and present danger to
the public health, safety, or general welfare, the Village Manager/Comptroller
shall be authorized to summarily order, by the issuance of a written order, the
cessation of business, the closing of the premises, and the suspension of any
license for a period not to exceed ten (10) days. The written order shall state
the reason for the cessation of business, the closing of the premises, and the
suspension of the license. Within eight (8) days after he or she has so acted,
the Village Manager/Comptroller shall call a hearing for the purpose of
determining whether or not the license should be suspended for an additional
period of time or revoked.
   (C)   Suspension or Revocation of License or Denial of Renewal. Any license
contemplated under this subchapter, unless otherwise provided, may be suspended
for up to thirty (30) days or revoked by the Village Manager/Comptroller or an
application for renewal of such license may be denied by the Village Manager/
Comptroller after notice and hearing as provided below for any of the following
causes:
      (1)   The commission of any act by the licensee which would be grounds to
deny an application for an initial license;
      (2)   Any violation by the licensee, its agents or employees of ordinance
provisions relating to the license, the subject matter of the license, or the
premises occupied:
      (3)   Any fraud perpetrated upon a customer of the business by the
licensee, its agents or employees;
      (4)   Conviction of the licensee, its agents or employees of any felony
or of a misdemeanor when such conviction indicates his or her inability to
conduct or operate a safe, honest, or legitimate business operation within the
Village;
      (5)   The licensee has conducted any activities directly related to the
licensee's business in the Village in an unlawful manner as to constitute a
breach of the peace or a menace to the health, safety, or general welfare of
the public;
      (6)   Refusal to permit an inspection or sampling, or any interference
with a duly authorized Village officer or employee while in the performance of
his or her duties in making such inspections or taking such samples, as
provided in this Code; or
      (7)   Any other violation by the licensee, its agents or employees of any
Village ordinances, resolutions, or regulations.
   (D)   Remedies not Exclusive. Such suspension or revocation, as the case
might be, if ordered, or denial of an application for renewal of a license
shall not preclude prosecution and imposition of any other penalties provided
for the violation of other applicable provisions of this Chapter or other
ordinances of the Village nor the institution of civil proceedings with respect
thereto.
   (E)   Hearing.
      (1)   Notice of the hearing for suspension or revocation of a license or
denial of an application for renewal of a license shall be given in writing
setting forth specifically the grounds of the complaint and the time and place
of the hearing. Such notice shall be personally served upon or sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee at his or her last
known address at least five (5) business days prior to the date set for the
hearing. A copy of the notice shall also be posted upon the licensee's place of

shall be filed in the records of the Village. All pleadings, motions, notices
and orders shall be filed with the Village Clerk.
      (2)   At the hearing, the Village Prosecutor shall present the complaint
and shall represent the Village. The Corporation Counsel shall represent and
advise the Village Manager/Comptroller. The Village Prosecutor shall have the
right to submit evidence, call witnesses to testify under oath, and to cross-
examine witnesses. The licensee shall be permitted counsel and shall have the
right to submit evidence, call witnesses to testify under oath, and cross-
examine witnesses. A stenographic or electronically recorded record of the
hearing shall be kept. The rules of evidence as applied in civil cases in the
circuit courts of Illinois shall be followed. Evidence not admissible under
those rules of evidence may be admitted, however, if it is of a type commonly
relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.
Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
Objection to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record.
The Village Manager/Comptroller shall preside and shall render the decision

      (3)   Upon suspension or revocation of a license or denial of an
application for renewal of a license by the Village Manager/Comptroller, the
licensee, or any person acting for the licensee, shall immediately cease
conducting or operating the business described in such suspended, revoked or
non-renewed license unless otherwise provided in the Village Manager/
Comptroller’s decision or the licensee files a Notice of Intent to appeal with
the Village Manager/Comptroller within two (2) days after receipt of service of
the Village Manager/Comptroller's decision. If the licensee files said Notice
of Intent, the licensee may continue conducting or operating said business
during the pendency of the appeal before the Corporate Authorities.
      (4)   Any licensee whose license is suspended or revoked or whose
application for renewal of a license has been denied shall pay to the Village
the costs of the hearing before the Village Manager/Comptroller. The Village
Manager/Comptroller shall determine the costs incurred by the Village for the
hearing, including, but not limited to, court reporter fees, the costs of
transcripts or records, attorneys' fees, the cost of preparing and mailing
notices and orders, and all other miscellaneous expenses incurred by the
Village or such lesser sum as the Village Manager/Comptroller may allow. The
licensee shall pay said costs to the Village within thirty (30) days of
notification of the costs by the Village Manager/Comptroller. Failure to pay
these costs within thirty (30) days of notification is a violation of this
section and shall be cause for license suspension or revocation or the levy of
a fine.
   (F)   Appeal. The decision of the Village Manager/ Comptroller to suspend or
revoke a license or deny an application for the renewal of a license may be
appealed to the Corporate Authorities by a writing under oath setting forth
specifically the grounds for appeal, within ten (10) days after receipt of
service of the Village Manager/Comptroller's decision. The Corporate
Authorities shall thereupon set the time and place for a hearing on such appeal
and notice of the hearing shall be given to the licensee in the same manner as
provided for the notice of the hearing before the Village Manager/Comptroller.
Upon appeal, the Corporate Authorities shall review the transcript of the
hearing, the evidence presented and the written decision of the Village
Manager/Comptroller. The Corporate Authorities shall render its decision on the
evidence and testimony presented at the hearing before the Village Manager/
Comptroller. No oral testimony, new or additional evidence shall be presented
to the Corporate Authorities at the appeal. The Corporate Authorities shall
render a decision within a reasonable time following its review of the
transcript of the hearing, the evidence presented and the written decision of
the Village Manager/Comptroller, but not later than thirty (30) days after such
review. The Corporate Authorities may affirm or reverse the decision of the
Village Manager/Comptroller or may remand the matter for further hearing. The
decision of the Corporate Authorities on appeal shall be by a vote of a
majority of the trustees then holding office. The decision of the Village
Manager/Comptroller shall be affirmed on appeal unless said decision is against
the manifest weight of the evidence, an abuse of discretion or a
misapprehension of the law. The Corporate Authorities' decision shall be in
writing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The decision of the
Corporate Authorities on such appeal shall be final and conclusive.
   (G)   Post-Hearing License Eligibility. When any license shall have been
revoked for any cause, no license shall be granted to the revoked licensee, or
any person acting for the revoked licensee, for the conduct or operation of the
business described in such revoked license until twelve (12) months after the
cause for the revocation has been abated, unless the revocation order has been
vacated.

statement of the time of expiration of the license held by the licensee, if an

renewal thereof, nor shall it be a defense in an action for operating without a
license.

to the applicant on or before the day the Village denies an application. The
applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the Village and resubmit the
revised application once within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent
to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The Village
shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the
applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to
resubmit the revised application within thirty (30) days of denial shall
require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and
recommencement of the Village's review period. The applicant must notify the
Village in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a
deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. Any
review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in
the denial. However, this revised application cure does not apply if the cure
requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be
collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the
small wireless facility.
         (e)   Pole Attachment Agreement. Within thirty (30) days after
approval of an application for a permit to collocate a small wireless facility

approved permits to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility
pole, the Village and the applicant shall enter into a License Supplement of
the Master Pole Attachment Agreement. The Village Manager shall be authorized
to execute the foregoing agreements without further approval by the Corporate
Authorities of the Village. Said execution by the Village Manager shall be
deemed to constitute the approval of the respective agreement by the Corporate
Authorities.
      (3)   Completeness of Application. Within thirty (30) days after
receiving an application, the Village shall determine whether the application
is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the
Village must specifically identify the missing information. An application
shall be deemed complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the
applicant within thirty (30) days after all documents, information and fees
specifically enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted
by the applicant to the Village. Processing deadlines are tolled from the time
the Village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant
provides the missing information.
      (4)   Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by:
         (a)   An express written agreement by both the applicant and the
Village; or
         (b)   A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar
emergency that causes the delay.

wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village shall be allowed, at
the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a
single permit for the collocation of up to twenty-five (25) small wireless
facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of
small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. If an
application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may remove
small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately
small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been
provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied.
The Village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in
a consolidated application.
      (6)   Duration of Permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period
of not less than five (5) years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent
durations unless the Village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities
or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable Village

and governmental standards and regulations.
      (3)   No Interference with Public Safety Communication Frequencies. The
wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not
interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety
communications. A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of
the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a
public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference will
be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the
FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety
spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. If a small
wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been
given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the
wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a
manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference
with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970
through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The Village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if
the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations
cited in the previous sentence. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
      (4)   The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities
on Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or
transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or
the electric supply zone of the pole. However, the antenna and support
equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications
space on the Village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise
unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work
involving the top of the pole. For purposes of this subsection, the terms
"communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric
supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric
Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers.
      (5)   The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and
local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety.
      (6)   The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards
that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a
Village ordinance, written policy adopted by the Village, a comprehensive plan,
or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-
way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. At a minimum,
a wireless provider shall comply with the following standards:
         (a)   Small Wireless Facility Equipment. A wireless provider shall,
whenever possible, locate the base of the equipment or appurtenances at a

in a consolidated application to collocate more than one (1) small wireless
facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures.
      (2)   Applicant shall pay an application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that
includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation.
      (3)   Notwithstanding any contrary provision of State law or local
ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the
required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable.
      (4)   The Village shall not require an application, approval or permit,
or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider
authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for:
         (a)   Routine maintenance;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless
provider notifies the Village at least ten (10) days prior to the planned
replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of
equipment consistent with the requirements of subsection (d) under the section
titled "Application Requirements"; or
         (c)   The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or

codes.
      (5)   Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the Village to work
within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require
lane closures.
   (E)   Exceptions to Applicability. Nothing in this chapter authorizes a
person to collocate small wireless facilities on:
      (1)   Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled
by the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within
rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure
without the consent of the property owner;
      (2)   Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest
preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation, or
conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding
the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district
that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local
government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or
      (3)   Property owned by a rail carrier registered under section 18c-7201
of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter
rail service, or an electric utility as defined in section 16-102 of the Public
Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail
service, or electric utility. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to an
electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the
facilities are being used, developed, and maintained consistent with the
provisions of subsection (i) of section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act.
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to
that term in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this chapter
shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement to obtain a
franchise or a State-issued authorization to offer cable service or video
service or to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or
operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject
to this chapter.
   (F)   Pre-Existing Agreements. Existing agreements between the Village and

in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on
Village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for
all small wireless facilities collocated on the Village's utility poles
pursuant to applications submitted to the Village before June 1, 2018, subject
to applicable termination provisions contained therein. Agreements entered into
after June 1, 2018, shall comply with this chapter. A wireless provider that
has an existing agreement with the Village on the June 1, 2018 may accept the
rates, fees and terms that the Village makes available under this chapter for
the collocation of small wireless facilities or the installation of new utility
poles for the collocation of small wireless facilities that are the subject of
an application submitted two (2) or more years after June 1, 2018 by notifying
the Village that it opts to accept such rates, fees and terms. The existing
agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for
the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the
Village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the Village
before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option
under this subsection.
   (G)   Annual Recurring Rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the Village an
annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a Village
utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (1) two-hundred dollars
($200.00) per year or (2) the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to
the wireless provider's use of space on the Village utility pole. If the
Village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the rate
shall be two-hundred dollars ($200.00) payable on the first day after the first
annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to
collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter.
   (H)   Abandonment.
      (1)   A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous
period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the
facility shall remove the small wireless facility within ninety (90) days after
receipt of written notice from the Village notifying the owner of the
abandonment. The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, by the Village to the owner at the last known address of the
owner. If the small wireless facility is not removed within ninety (90) days of
such notice, the Village may remove or cause the removal of such facility
pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility
poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by
other law for removal and cost recovery.
      (2)   A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the Village if
it sells or transfers small wireless facilities subject to this chapter within
the jurisdictional boundary of the Village. Such notice shall include the name
and contact information of the new wireless provider.
(Ord. 18-4075, passed 7-19-18)
§ 126.04 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
   The Circuit Court of Cook County shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
resolve all disputes arising under the Act and this chapter. Pending resolution
of a dispute concerning rates for collocation of small wireless facilities on
municipal utility poles within the right-of-way, the Village shall allow the
collocating person to collocate on its poles at annual rates of no more than
two-hundred dollars ($200.00) per year per municipal utility pole, with rates
to be determined upon final resolution of the dispute.
(Ord. 18-4075, passed 7-19-18)
§ 126.05 INDEMNIFICATION.
   A wireless provider shall indemnify and hold the Village harmless against
any and all liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting
from or arising out of, in whole or in part, the use or occupancy of the
Village improvements or right-of-way associated with such improvements by the
wireless provider or its employees, agents, or contractors arising out of the
rights and privileges granted under this chapter and the Act. A wireless
provider has no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless against any
liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the sole negligence of the
Village or its employees or agents. A wireless provider shall further waive any
claims that they may have against the Village with respect to consequential,
incidental, or special damages, however caused, based on the theory of
liability.
(Ord. 18-4075, passed 7-19-18)
§ 126.06 INSURANCE.
   (A)   A wireless provider shall carry, at the wireless provider's own cost
and expense, the following insurance:
      (1)   Property insurance for its property's replacement cost against all
risks;
      (2)   Workers' compensation insurance, as required by law; or
      (3)   Commercial general liability insurance with respect to its
activities on the Village improvements or rights-of-way to afford minimum
protection limits consistent with the Village's requirements of other users of
Village improvements or rights-of-way, including coverage for bodily injury and
property damage. The wireless provider shall include the Village as an
additional insured on the commercial general liability policy and provide
certification and documentation of inclusion of the Village in a commercial
general liability policy prior to the collocation of any wireless facility.
   (B)   A wireless provider may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required by the Village. A wireless provider
that self-insures is not required, to the extent of the self-insurance, to
comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under this
section. A wireless provider that elects to self-insure shall provide to the
Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure
the insurance coverage and limits required by the Village.
(Ord. 18-4075, passed 7-19-18)
§ 126.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or application thereof to any person or
circumstances is ruled unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, such invalidity
shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be
given effect without the invalid application or provision, and each invalid
provision or invalid application of this chapter is severable.

THEFT
§ 131.50 THEFT.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to commit theft within the corporate limits of
the Village. A person commits theft when he or she knowingly:
      (1)   Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner;
or,
      (2)   Obtains by deception control over property of the owner; or,
      (3)   Obtains by threat control over property of the owner; or,
      (4)   Obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have
been stolen or under such circumstances as would reasonably induce him or her
to believe that the property was stolen; or,
      (5)   Obtains or exerts control over property in the custody of any law
enforcement agency which any law enforcement officer or any individual acting
on behalf of a law enforcement agency explicitly represents to the person as
being stolen or represents to the person such circumstances as would reasonably
induce the person to believe that the property was stolen, and
         (a)   Intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit
of the property; or,
         (b)   Knowingly uses, conceals or abandons the property in such manner
as to deprive the owner permanently of such use or benefit; or,
         (c)   Uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing such use,
concealment or abandonment probably will deprive the owner permanently of such
use or benefit.
   (B)   The trier of fact may infer evidence that a person intends to deprive
the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property (1) if a lessee of
the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within ten
days after written demand from the owner for its return or (2) if a lessee of
the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 24
hours after written demand from the owner for its return and the lessee had
presented identification to the owner that contained a materially fictitious
name, address, or telephone number. A notice in writing, given after the
expiration of the leasing agreement, addressed and mailed, by registered mail,
to the lessee at the address given by him and shown on the leasing agreement
shall constitute proper demand.
   (C)   The trier of fact may infer that a person "knowingly obtains by
deception control over property of the owner" when he or she fails to return,
within 45 days after written demand from the owner, the downpayment and any
additional payments accepted under a promise, oral or in writing, to perform
services for the owner for consideration of $3,000 or more, and the promisor
knowingly without good cause failed to substantially perform pursuant to the
agreement after taking a down payment of 10% or more of the agreed upon
consideration. This provision shall not apply where the owner initiated the
suspension of performance under the agreement, or where the promisor responds
to the notice within the 45 day notice period. A notice in writing, addressed
and mailed, by registered mail, to the promisor at the last known address of
the promisor, shall constitute proper demand.
   (D)   Offender's interest in the property.
      (1)   It is no defense to a charge of theft of property that the offender
has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the
offender is not entitled.
      (2)   Where the property involved is that of the offender's spouse, no
prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living
together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the
alleged theft.
(Ord. 23-4347, passed 3-2-23) Penalty, see §
131.99
§ 131.51 THEFT OF LOST OR MISLAID PROPERTY.

   (A)   Knows or learns the identity of the owner or knows, or is aware of, or
learns of a reasonable method of identifying the owner; and,
   (B)   Fails to take reasonable measures to restore the property to the
owner; and,

131.99

   (A)   A person commits theft when he or she knowingly obtains the temporary
use of property, labor or services of another which are available only for
hire, by means of threat or deception or knowing that such use is without the
consent of the person providing the property, labor or services. For the
purposes of this subsection, library material is available for hire.
   (B)   A person commits theft when after (1) renting or leasing a motor
vehicle, (2) obtaining a motor vehicle through a "driveaway" service mode of
transportation, (3) renting or leasing equipment exceeding $500 in value
including tools, construction or industry equipment, and such items as linens,
tableware, tents, tables, chairs and other equipment specially rented for a
party or special event, or (4) renting or leasing any other type of personal
property exceeding $500 in value, under an agreement in writing which provides
for the return of the vehicle, equipment, or other personal property to a
particular place at a particular time, he or she without good cause knowingly
fails to return the vehicle, equipment, or other personal property to that
place within the time specified, and is thereafter served or sent a written
demand mailed to the last known address, made by certified mail return receipt
requested, to return the vehicle, equipment, or other personal property within
three days from the mailing of the written demand, and who without good cause
knowingly fails to return the vehicle, equipment, or any other personal
property to any place of business of the lessor within the return period. The
trier of fact may infer evidence that the person is without good cause if the
person signs the agreement with a name or address other than his or her own.
   (C)   A person commits theft when he or she borrows from a library facility
library material which has an aggregate value of $50 or more pursuant to an
agreement with or procedure established by the library facility for the return
of such library material, and knowingly without good cause fails to return the
library material so borrowed in accordance with such agreement or procedure,
and further knowingly without good cause fails to return such library material
within 30 days after receiving written notice by certified mail from the
library facility demanding the return of such library material.
   (D)   In addition to any other penalty imposed, the court may order a person
convicted under this section to make restitution to the victim of the offense.
(Ord. 23-4347, passed 3-2-23) Penalty, see §
131.99

indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed

to purchase such merchandise at less than the full retail value with the
intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such
merchandise; or,
      (3)   Transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for
sale in a retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which
such merchandise is displayed to any other container with the intention of
depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or,
      (4)   Under-rings with the intention of depriving the merchant of the
full retail value of the merchandise; or,
      (5)   Removes a shopping cart from the premises of a retail mercantile
establishment without the consent of the merchant given at the time of such
removal with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the
possession, use or benefit of such cart; or,

attempts to convey that property to a merchant who is the owner of the property
in exchange for money, merchandise credit or other property of the merchant;
or,
      (7)   Uses or possesses any theft detection shielding device or theft
detection device remover with the intention of using such device to deprive the

the property when a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return
it to the owner, or if the lessee fails to pay the full retail value of such
property to the lessor in satisfaction of any contractual provision requiring
such, within ten days after written demand from the owner for its return. A
notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by
registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on
the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
   (B)   Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when
he or she commits a retail theft as defined in subsections (A)(l) through (A)
(8) of this section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail
mercantile establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.
   (C)   If any person:
      (1)   Conceals upon his or her person or among his or her belongings
unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail
mercantile establishment; and,
      (2)   Removes that merchandise beyond the last known station for
receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile
establishment, then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed,
carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it
or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession,
use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such
merchandise.
   To CONCEAL merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of its
presence, that merchandise is not visible through ordinary observation.
   (D)   Multiple thefts committed by the same person as part of a continuing
course of conduct in different jurisdictions that have been aggregated in one
jurisdiction may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which one or more of the
thefts occurred.

building permit application shall be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator,
Village Manager or Building Official, or such designee, to ensure compliance
with the Schiller Park Zoning Ordinance. If the work will be undertaken

§ 150.032 EXAMINATION OF PLANS ACCOMPANYING APPLICATION; PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   The application for a permit required by §
150.030, with plans, shall be referred to the Building Official, or such
designee, who shall examine the same to determine whether the proposed
alterations will comply with the ordinance provisions relating thereto. Upon
approval, one set of plans shall be returned by the Building Official, or such
designee. No permit shall be issued except after approval of the plans and the
payment of any applicable fees provided in the fee schedule that has been
adopted by the Village Board, and which may change from time to time as
determined in the best interests of the Village.
   (B)   The applicable fees provided in the fee schedule in subsection (A),
with the exception of fees for third-party plan reviews, shall be waived for an
individual who has attained the age of sixty-two (62) years old provided that
the permit is for either 1) a single-family dwelling that the individual owns
and occupies as his or her principal residence, or has a lease that makes the
individual responsible for the real estate taxes and occupies as his or her
principal residence, and the construction value of the work for which the
permit is sought does not exceed $12,000.00; or 2) a single-family dwelling
that the individual owns and occupies as his or her principal residence and is
receiving a Cook County Senior Citizen Exemption, and the construction value of
the work for which the permit is sought does not exceed $12,000.00.
      To obtain a fee waiver, the individual must submit documentation to prove
ownership of the property that may include a deed to the property, or a lease
for the property that proves responsibility for the property's real estate
taxes; documentation to prove the property is the principal residence of the
individual and the age of the individual may include a real estate tax bill for
the property, a Driver's License, an Illinois Identification Card, Alien
Registration Card, Social Security Card, Naturalization Papers, or Birth
Certificate; or the most recent second- installment real estate tax bill that
shows the property is receiving a Cook County Senior Citizen Exemption. The
Building Official is authorized to establish additional eligibility criteria
and rules for said fee waiver.
      In the event the property no longer qualifies for the fee waiver during
the term of the permit or the construction value of the work exceeds
$12,000.00, the individual that obtained the fee waiver shall notify the
Building Official of said fact within thirty (30) days of such change. If the
Village determines that the fee waiver was approved under false pretenses or
the individual failed to notify the Village of a change in eligibility within
the required timeframe, the individual may be liable for any previously waived
fees as well as any applicable penalties or fines.
   (C)   The applicable fees provided in the fee schedule in subsection (A),
with the exception of fees for third-party plan reviews, shall be waived for a
governmental entity, not-for- profit educational or religious institution that
is exempt from the payment of real estate taxes and located within the Village
provided that the construction value of the work for which the permit is sought
does not exceed $250,000.00.
      To obtain a fee waiver, the unit of local government or institution must
submit documentation to demonstrate not- for-profit status and proof of real
estate tax exemption. The Building Official is authorized to establish
additional eligibility criteria and rules for said fee waiver.
      In the event the property no longer qualifies for the fee waiver during
the term of the permit or the construction value of the work exceeds
$250,000.00, the entity that obtained the fee waiver shall notify the Building
Official of said fact within thirty (30) days of such change. If the Village
determines that the fee wavier was approved under false pretenses or the entity
failed to notify the Village of a change in eligibility within the required
timeframe, the individual may be liable for any previously waived fees as well
as any applicable penalties or fines.

   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to construct
any structure in variance of approved plans pursuant to which a building permit
has been issued in conformity with §
150.030, unless such construction has been varied in accord with modified plans
and specifications which have been approved by the Chief Inspector. In the
event additional construction costs result, because of such variation, the
permittee shall pay the additional permit fee at the time such approval is
sought.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful to erect or assemble within the corporate limits
of the Village any prefabricated or factory-manufactured building having a
gross floor area in excess of 400 square feet and/or to use any prefabricated

§ 150.036 ADDITIONAL CONTRACTOR'S BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The following bonds shall be deposited with the Village before a

is issued. This Chapter does not apply to any contractor who is protected by
The Private Detective, Private Alarm, Private Security, Fingerprint Vendor, and

under the protection of this act will be regulated only by the State of
Illinois and required only to provide a copy of their State License number to
the Village of Schiller Park to comply with Village Permit Applications.
Otherwise, for those contractors not covered by the Act, the bond shall be in
such a form as approved by the Village and shall be issued by a company duly
authorized by law to issue such bonds in Illinois.

all damages that may arise to the public ways and to the Village, and to any
person, in consequence or by reason of such contractor's occupation and
operation within the Village. Any contractor protected by the Act is held to
the State of Illinois standards and shall comply with those standards in order
to obtain a State of Illinois License. Any Contractor protected by the Act who
cannot produce a State of Illinois License shall not be permitted to do any
work within the Village and the State shall be notified as to the lack of
credentials of the individual applicant so that they may take action.
   (B)   In addition to any and all other bonds required to be posted by the
above referenced contractors under this section, contractors—with the exception
of those protected by the Act—shall also be required to post a license and
permit bond in the amount of $10,000.00 executed by a surety company that is
authorized to transact business in the State of Illinois as surety on the bond
with the contractor as principal on the bond, and the Village as the obligee,
for the Village's benefit and for the benefit of consumers dealing with the
contractor, conditioned that the contractor shall faithfully perform the duties
and in all things comply with the ordinances and regulations of the Village,
pertaining to the permit or license applied for. The bond shall be valid for
one year from the date of application and the bond shall provide that it may
only be terminated if the surety provided thirty (30) days notice, in writing,
by certified mail and return receipt requested to the Village of the
termination or expiration of the bond.

Village shall be required to maintain, at all times such license is in effect,
general liability insurance coverage and worker's compensation insurance
coverage. Evidence of such insurance must be filed with the Village and shall
be updated periodically upon request. This, however, does not apply to any
contractor who is protected by The Private Detective, Private Alarm, Private
Security, Fingerprint Vendor, and Locksmith Act of 2004 (225 ILCS 447/5 et
seq.) ("the Act"). Contractors falling under the protection of this act will be
regulated only by the State of Illinois and required only to provide a copy of
their State License number to the Village of Schiller Park to comply with
Village Permit Applications. Otherwise, for those contractors not covered by
the Act, the bond shall be in such a form as approved by the Village and shall

REGISTRATION OF DEFAULTED  MORTGAGE AND VACANT PROPERTY
§ 150.240 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   It is the purpose and intent of the Village Board to establish a process to
address the deterioration, crime, and decline in value of Village of Schiller
Park neighborhoods caused by property with defaulted mortgages located within
the Village of Schiller Park, and to identify, regulate, limit and reduce the
number of these properties located within the Village of Schiller Park. It has
been determined that owner-occupied structures are generally better maintained
when compared to vacant structures, even with a diligent off-site property
owner. Vacant structures or structures owned by individuals who are
economically strained and unable to meet their mortgage obligations are often
not properly or diligently maintained, which contribute to blight, declined
property values, and have a negative impact on social perception of the
residential areas where they are located. It is the Village Board's further
intent to establish a registration program as a mechanism to help protect
neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance
of properties that are in default or defaulted, and to provide a mechanism to
avert foreclosure actions through timely intervention, education, or counseling
of property owners.
(Ord. 19-4144, passed 4-18-19)

previous mortgagee will not be released from the responsibility of paying all
previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties accrued during that mortgagee's

and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related
land resources. This Chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following
specific purposes.
   (A)   To meet the requirements of ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, § 18g Rivers, Lakes
and Streams Act;
   (B)   To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage
hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
   (C)   To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from
flood damage;
   (D)   To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding;
   (E)   To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects,
repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and
relief operations; and
   (F)   To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in
the Village by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program;
   (G)   To comply with the rules and regulations of the National Flood
Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended;
   (H)   To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and
water resources; and
   (I)   To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses
and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve
water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat,
provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance
community and economic development.

§ 151.04 RESPONSIBILITY.
   The Chief Inspector and a professional engineer appointed by the President
and Board of Trustees will be jointly (hereinafter designated as Chief
Inspector and Village Engineer) shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the
duties listed in this Section.
   To fulfill those duties, the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer first
should use the criteria listed in §
151.06 to determine whether the development site is located within a
floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a
floodplain, the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer must determine whether the
development site is within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway, or within a
SFHA or floodplain on no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a
flood fringe, the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer shall require that the
minimum requirements of §
151.52 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the Chief Inspector and
Village Engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of §
151.53 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no
detailed study has been completed and approved, the Chief Inspector and Village
Engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of §
151.54 be met.
   In addition, the general requirements of §
151.55 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of §§
151.52,
151.53, or
151.54. The Chief Inspector and Village Engineer shall assure that all
subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of §
151.07.
   If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the Chief Inspector, Village
Engineer, and Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the requirements of §
151.51 to make sure that they are met. In addition, the Chief Inspector and
Village Engineer shall complete all notification requirements.
   In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this
Section, the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer may take any and all actions
as outlined in §
151.09.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.05 WETLANDS.
   (A)   Protection of Depressional Storage. The storm water storage capacity
in wetlands and in natural storage areas identified in the Flood Insurance
Study (Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated August 19, 2008) shall be
maintained. This storm water storage capacity shall be maintained on the
development site or shall be compensated within the watershed at a site
designated by the Chief Inspector. Storage required to meet the storm water
detention criteria of this chapter shall be provided in addition to the
existing identified depressional storage capacity.
   (B)   Protection of Wetlands. Wetlands shall be protected from the adverse
changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In
addition to other requirements of this code, the following mitigation criteria
shall be met for all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands:
      (1)   The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by
appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures.
      (2)   All runoff from the development shall be routed through a
preliminary detention/ sedimentation basin designed to capture the two-year,
24-hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours, before being discharged to an
existing wetland. This basin shall be constructed before property grading
begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined herein should be followed
to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetlands.
      (3)   A buffer strip at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated with
native plant species, shall be maintained around the periphery of the wetland.

remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of
the Village shall be according to the best existing data available in the
Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository.
      (1)   When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists,
the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall
be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model
such as HIP.
      (2)   The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from
a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in
various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for
estimating peak flood discharges.
      (3)   Along any water-courses draining more than one square mile, the
above analyses shall be submitted to DNR/OWR for approval. Once approved it
must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information
Repository for filing.
      (4)   For a non-riverine SFHA, the Base Flood Elevation shall be the
historic Flood of Record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed
engineering study and approved by DNR/OWR for drainage areas greater than one
square mile.

that they are known in all official actions related to land management, use and
development.
   (A)   New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements, and
Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure
that the proposed developments are consistent with §§
151.52,
151.53,
151.54 and
151.55 of this Chapter and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans
for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and Planned Unit Developments (PUDs)
shall include a signed statement by a Registered Professional Engineer that the
plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface waters in
accordance with the Plat Act (ILCS Ch. 765, Act 205, § 2).
   (B)   Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel
trailer parks, Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured
home parks and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this
information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois
State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for
calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per §
151.06(D) and the floodway delineation per the definition in §
151.02. The applicant's engineer shall submit the data to DNR/OWR for review
and approval as best available regulatory data and then send it to the State
Water Survey.
   (C)   Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located
and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and
channels. Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or
other public grounds.
   (D)   The (City Council, Board of Trustees, County Board) shall not approve
any Planned Unit Development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the
corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.08 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information
derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This
Chapter does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA,
will be free from flooding or damage. This Chapter does not create liability on
the part of the Village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision made
lawfully thereunder.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.09 PENALTY.
   Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a
variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this Chapter. Upon due
investigation, the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer may determine that a
violation of the minimum standards of this Chapter exits. The Chief Inspector
and Village Engineer shall notify the owner in writing of such a violation.
   (A)   If such owner fails to correct the violation after ten days' notice:
      (1)   The Village may make application to the Circuit Court for an
injunction requiring conformance with this Chapter, or make such other order as
the Court deems necessary to secure compliance with this Chapter.
      (2)   Any person or persons who violate this Chapter shall, upon
conviction thereof, be fined not less than $100, nor more than $1,000 for each
offense.
      (3)   A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during
or on which a violation occurs or continues.
      (4)   The Village may record a notice of violation on the title to the
property.
   (B)   The Chief Inspector and the Village Engineer shall inform the owner
that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages
and, therefore, may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall prevent the Village from taking such other lawful
action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall
accrue to the person or persons responsible.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.10 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. Where this Chapter and other
ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. This Chapter
is intended to repeal the original ordinance or resolution which was adopted to
meet the National Flood Insurance Program regulations, but is not intended to
repeal the resolution which the Village passed in order to establish initial
eligibility for the program.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.11 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions and sections of this Chapter shall be deemed severable and

STORMWATER DETENTION
§ 151.20 DETENTION REQUIRED.
   No person or persons shall cause any development on any property in the
Village without providing stormwater detention facilities as herein described
and specified.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.21 EXCEPTIONS.
   The Chief Inspector of the Board of Fire Prevention may waive the

following conditions exist:
   (A)   The proposed development consists of improvements to a single
residential lot or parcel with a total area of one acre or less, recorded prior
to the effective date of this Chapter. Properties subdivided to form smaller
parcels after the effective date of this Chapter will be subject to all
detention requirements described herein. Such subdivisions must provide a
master drainage plan, including provisions for stormwater detention, before any
of the subdivided parcels may be developed.
   (B)   The proposed development consists of home improvements or additions to
an existing residence, and it can be satisfactorily verified that the
improvements will not increase the value of the premises by more than fifty
percent (50%) of its then current value.

which have been damaged by fire, storm, or flood.
   (D)   The property to be developed is all, or a wholly contained part of an
approved development for which stormwater detention was previously provided, or
planned to the satisfaction of the Village authorities in the form of on-site
detention, off-site detention, fee in lieu of, or some combination of the
above. Development of property shall be allowed to take place according to the
conditions of previously approved detention standards and stipulations
provided, however, that previously approved concept plans and/or preliminary
plats shall not retain their approved status for stormwater detention proposals
for longer than one year if no construction or development takes place within
that time.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.22 DRAINAGE PLAN REQUIRED.
   When a detention facility is proposed, the applicant shall submit plans and

(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.23 RUNOFF VOLUME AND RATES.
   In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall
choose a strategy which strives to minimize the increase in runoff volumes and
rates from the site. The applicant shall observe the following hierarchy in
developing a drainage plan:
   (A)   Minimization of impervious surfaces on the property;
   (B)   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and retention of
natural depressions, or construction of new ones, in conjunction with retention
of existing natural stream channels;
   (C)   Infiltration of stormwater runoff on-site;
   (D)   Stormwater retention structures;
   (E)   Stormwater detention structures;

   At all times the applicant shall keep in mind ground water quality and
public safety and convenience in the selection of drainage plan elements.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.24 RELEASE RATES.
   (A)   Site Discharge. The drainage system for a property shall be designed
to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for the 2-year, 24-
hour, and the 100-year, 24-hour storm events to levels which will not cause an
increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in
aggregate with other development properties and downstream drainage capacities.
The peak discharge from the developed site shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs
per acre developed for events less than or equal to the 2-year event. The peak
discharge from the developed site shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre
developed for events less than or equal to the 100-year event.
   (B)   Minimum Restrictor Size. In no case will discharge orifices less than
two (2) inches in inside diameter be allowed. When the calculated allowable
discharge for a development is exceptionally small due to the small size of the
site, a two (2) inch diameter orifice may be too large to adequately restrict
the discharge. In this case the following criteria may apply:
      (1)   The detention volume required shall be calculated according to both
the theoretical maximum allowable release rate, and the actual maximum
discharge utilizing the two (2) inch diameter restrictor. Detention shall be
provided on site according to the actual discharge. Any difference in the
detention provided, and the theoretical detention required shall be compensated
for using the "Fee in Lieu of Detention" criteria described in §
151.41.
      (2)   If the theoretical maximum allowable release rate for the 100-year
event can be accommodated with a two (2) inch diameter or larger restrictor,
but the 2-year event cannot, then the 0.04 cfs per acre developed maximum
release rate may be waived.

§ 151.25 WATER QUALITY AND MULTIPLE USES.
   The drainage system should be designed to minimize adverse water quality
impacts downstream and on the property itself. Detention basins shall
incorporate design features to capture stormwater runoff pollutants. Detention
and infiltration of stormwater shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of stormwater runoff, and to reduce the
quantity of runoff pollutants.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.26 HYDROLOGIC DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   The design of the drainage system shall be developed and evaluated by the
applicant based on routing runoff hydrographs for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-
year, 24-hour events through its minor and major components. In addition, a
general assessment of the impacts of flows exceeding the 100-year event shall
be presented.
   (A)   Rainfall. Unless a contiguous simulation approach to the drainage
system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events shall be based on the
Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) Bulletin 70. Third quartile median point
rainfall distribution by Huff of the ISWS shall be assumed for discharge
estimations. SCS Type II distributions shall also be acceptable for detention
basin design.
   (B)   Stormwater runoff must be developed as part of the design of the
drainage system's minor and major components. The SCS TR-55, TR-20, ACOE HEC-1,
or other method approved by the Chief Inspector of the Board of Fire Prevention
shall be used for the generation of hydrographs, subject to rainfall
distribution modifications for all properties larger than five acres.
   (C)   Antecedent Moisture. All computations of runoff hydrographs which do
not rely on a contiguous accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall
assume the following antecedent moisture conditions:
      (1)   SCS TR-55 - antecedent moisture condition two; and
      (2)   ILLUDAS - number three, "rather wet".
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.27 HYDRAULIC DESIGN PROCEDURES.
   A profile and mapping of floodwater depths and coverage shall be prepared
for the property for the 2-year, 10-year, and 100-year events. Directions of
flow and velocities shall also be reported for critical points in the drainage
system.
   (A)   Detention. Minimum available storage to be provided in a detention
basin shall be based upon the stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour
event and reservoir routing (also called level pool), or equivalent.
   (B)   Streets. Detention storage on streets is strongly discouraged, and
will only be allowed after other methods have been exhausted. Detention storage
on streets will then only be allowed according to the following criteria:
      (1)   Detention storage will only be allowed on collector, or side
streets that do not provide the sole access to an area.
      (2)   Detention storage on streets shall not cause ponding depths to
exceed curb heights by more than one inch, or a total of seven inches,
whichever is greater. No street shall remain flooded for more than eight hours
for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event.
      (3)   The Village accepts no liability for any property damage or
personal injury resulting from inundation of any street caused by storing of
stormwater detention on the pavement. The developer and the developer's
engineer must provide a letter to the Village accepting all such liability.
   (C)   Parking Lots. Detention storage will be allowed on parking lots on
private developments according to the following criteria:
      (1)   The maximum ponding depth for parking lots is seven inches.
      (2)   The Village accepts no liability for any property damage or
personal injury resulting from inundation of any parking lot caused by storing
of stormwater detention on the pavement. The developer and the developer's
engineer must provide a letter to the Village accepting all such liability.

§ 151.28 WET BASINS.
   Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available for recreational use.
   (A)   Depths. Wet basins shall be at least eight feet deep (three feet if
aerated), excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to
be provided, the pond shall be at least ten feet deep over at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out.
   (B)   Permanent Pool Volume.  The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at
normal depth shall be equal to, or greater than the runoff volume from its
watershed for the 2-year event.
   (C)   Nuisance Control. Wet basins shall be designed in a manner which will
reduce as much as practicable nuisance problems such as algae.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.29 DRY BASINS.
   Dry detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to
be safe, and as much as feasible, to be available for multiple uses.
   (A)   Drainage basins shall be designed so that eighty percent (80%) of
their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours after any
runoff event equal to or less than the 100-year event, and after any tailwater
affecting the discharge from the pond recedes. Underdrains directed to the pond
outlet shall be used if necessary to accomplish this requirement.
   (B)   All dry detention basins shall be designed to remove stormwater
pollutants.

   The drainage system components, especially all detention basins, shall be
designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with
the system during runoff events.
   (A)   Shorelines. The shorelines of all detention basins at 100-year
capacity shall be as flat as practicable to prevent accidental falls into the
basin, for bank stability, and for ease of maintenance. Pond shorelines shall
have a slope of four to one (horizontal to vertical) wherever possible, and in
no cases be greater than three to one.
   (B)   Banks. Pond bank sideslopes shall have a slope of four to one
(horizontal to vertical) wherever possible, and in no cases be greater than
three to one.
   (C)   Safety Ledge. All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge
extending five feet into the basin from the shoreline and two feet below the
normal water level.
   (D)   Velocity. Velocities throughout the drainage system shall be
controlled to safe levels taking into consideration rates and depth of flow.
   (E)   Overflow Structures. All stormwater detention basins shall be provided
with clearly defined overflow facilities capable of safely passing overflows so
that downstream damage to properties is prevented.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.31 INFILTRATION RATION PRACTICES.
   Infiltration practices including basins, trenches, and porous pavement shall
only be allowed in soils considered "A" or "B" by the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service. Infiltration practices shall not be located within 75 feet of a water
supply well or a building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be
provided, where practicable, to remove coarse sedimentation from stormwater
flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Stormwater shall not
be allowed to stand more than 72 hours over eighty percent (80%) of a dry
basin's bottom area for the maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom
of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four feet above seasonally
high groundwater and bedrock.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.32 DETENTION IN FLOODPLAINS.
   Stormwater detention shall only be allowed in floodplains when all other
options have been exhausted. Then detention shall be allowed according to the
following criteria:
   (A)   Detention shall not be permitted in floodways, except for on-stream
detention as discussed in subsection (C) of this Section.
   (B)   The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall
require compensatory storage for 1.1 times the volume below the base flood
elevation occupied by the detention basin, including any berms. The release
from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with
the requirements of §
151.24. The applicant shall certify its operation for all streamflow and
floodplain backwater conditions. This should include both the free flow
discharge from the basin (no tailwater), as well maximum tailwater caused by
the floodplain or other sources.
   Excavations for compensatory storage along streams and watercourses shall be
opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by the detention basin. All
compensatory storage shall be placed in accordance with §
151.52 of this Chapter.
   (C)   On-stream detention basins are allowable only if they provide regional
public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this Code with respect
to water quality and control of the 2-year and 100-year, 24-hour storm events
from the property. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than
one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant use dynamic modeling to
demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties upstream
or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-
stream detention:
      (1)   Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality
or stream aquatic habitat,
      (2)   Shall include a design calling for gradual back slopes, appropriate
bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin, and
      (3)   Shall comply with 92 Illinois Administrative Code Part 708 dated
November 29, 1988 and this Code.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.33 DETENTION IN WETLANDS.
   Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of stormwater
detention unless it is demonstrated that the proposed modification, including
such activities as filling, draining, excavation and vegetation removal, will
maintain or improve habitat and water quality. In addition, fill shall not be
placed in the wetland and long-term monitoring and maintenance agreement shall
be established to ensure that the modified wetland/detention facility continues
to provide wetland functions.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.34 GENERAL DETENTION CONSIDERATIONS FOR WATER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT.
   Detention basins shall be designed to enhance water quality.
   (A)   Inlet and Outlet Orientation. As much as feasible, the distance
between inlets to, and outlet from any detention basin should be maximized. If
possible, the inlets and outlet should be at opposite ends of the basin.
   (B)   Velocity Dissipation. Baffles or berms should be placed perpendicular
to the direction of flow through a detention basin to reduce velocity and
prevent scour.
   (C)   Maintenance. The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to
minimize and facilitate maintenance. Turfed sideslopes should be designed to
allow lawn-mowing equipment to easily negotiate them. Wet basins should be
provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely drain the pool
for sediment removal. Presedimentation basins should be considered for
localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment should
be provided.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.35 PROTECTION OF DEPRESSIONAL STORAGE.
   Existing depressional storage areas in wetlands and identified on the site
topography shall be maintained:
   (A)   Any existing storage volume identified on the site shall be
compensated for on site in addition to any volume required for stormwater
detention or filling within the floodplain, and
   (B)   The release rates of the undeveloped site shall be analyzed. If the
existing depressional storage causes stormwater to leave the site at a rate
less than 0.04 cfs per acre for the 2-year storm event, and/or 0.15 cfs per
acre for the 100-year storm event, the lower release rates shall be used in
designing the detention basin.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.36 IDENTIFICATION OF WETLANDS.
   To determine if wetlands exist on a given site, a wetland investigation
shall be performed by a qualified firm:
   (A)   Any time the National Wetland Inventory Map indicates wetlands may be
present,
   (B)   Existing topography indicates conditions conducive to wetland
formation, such as existing depressional areas, and/or
   (C)   Any time the Village Engineer deems a wetland investigation is
appropriate and necessary.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.37 PROTECTION OF WETLANDS.
   Wetlands shall be protected from the adverse changes in runoff quality and
quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other
requirements of this Code, the following mitigation criteria shall be met for
all developments whose drainage flows into wetlands:
   (A)   The existing wetland shall be protected during the construction by
appropriate soil erosion and sediment control measures.
   (B)   All stormwater runoff from the development shall be routed through a
preliminary detention/ sedimentation basin designed to capture the 2-year, 24-
hour event and hold it for at least 24 hours before entering an existing
detention pond. The basin shall be constructed before any site grading begins.
In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined herein should be followed to
minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland.
   (C)   A buffer strip at least 25 feet in width, preferably vegetated, with
native plant species, shall be maintained around the periphery of the wetland.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.38 FLOWS FROM TRIBUTARY AREAS.
   Storm-water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered
in the design of the property's drainage system.
   (A)   Upstream Area Not Meeting Code Requirements. When areas exist upstream
of the property that do not meet the storage and release rates of this Code,
regionalized detention on the applicant's property shall be explored by the
applicant. The following steps shall be followed:
      (1)   The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his
property using the release rates prescribed herein, the applicant's property
area, and the procedures described herein.
      (2)   Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the
storage and release rate requirements of this Code, shall be identified.
      (3)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property
area, allowable release rates shall be determined according to the criteria
detailed in §
151.24.
      (4)   Using the areas determined above plus the applicant's property
area, and the release rate determined in Step 3, above, the total storage
needed for the combined properties shall be computed. If tributary areas are
not developed, a reasonable fully developed land cover shall be assumed for the
purposes of computing storage.
      (5)   Once the necessary combined storage is computed, the Village may
choose to pay for oversizing the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the
regional flows. The applicant's responsibility will be limited to the storage
for his property as computed in Step 1, above. If regional storage is selected
by the Village, then the design produced in Step 3, above, shall be
implemented. If regional storage is rejected by the Village, the applicant has
the option of bypassing all tributary area flows through or around the
applicant's basin according to the procedures detailed in §
151.39.
   (B)   Upstream Areas Meeting Code Requirements. When areas exist upstream of
the applicant's property that meet the requirements of this Code, the upstream
flows shall either be bypassed around, or routed through the applicant's
detention basin at the discretion of the Village. Storage needed for the
applicant's property shall still be computed as described above. However, if
the Village decides to route tributary area flows through an applicant's basin,
the final design stormwater releases shall be based on the combined total of
the applicant's property plus the tributary area.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.39 BYPASS FLOW.
   If flows from any upstream tributary areas are not to be detained on the
applicant's site in a regional facility, the flows from upstream may bypass the
applicant's site in one of two ways:
   (A)   The flows from upstream may be collected and conveyed around the
applicant's site.
      (1)   The bypass conveyance system shall be separate from the system used
to collect and convey stormwater on the applicant's site.
      (2)   The bypass conveyance system must be capable of conveying .the
stormwater runoff from the 100-year storm without causing increased flood
stages on the applicant's site, or in the areas upstream of the applicant's
site.
      (3)   The point of discharge for the bypass conveyance system shall be
the same as that for the undeveloped site, or as directed by the Village
Engineer.
   (B)   Alternately, the flows from upstream may be passed through the
applicant's storm drainage system.
      (1)   The applicant shall compute the stormwater runoff hydrograph for
the site, without considering any bypass flows.
      (2)   The applicant shall then compute the stormwater hydrograph for the
total watershed, including all upstream tributary areas.
      (3)   The outlet structure controlling discharge from the detention basin
shall be designed as follows:
         (a)   The orifice, or other type restrictor shall be sized to release
no more than the maximum allowable release rate for the site, as described in §
151.24. The runoff hydrograph from the site for the 100-year storm shall then
be routed through the detention basin to determine a high water level, not
considering any bypass flow.
         (b)   An overflow spillway, or other outlet structure shall be
designed to discharge flow from the detention basin when the water level rises
to a level higher than that determined in subsection (B)(3)(a) above. The
maximum discharge rate for this outlet structure shall be the difference of the
two runoff hydrographs determined in subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2).
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.40 EARLY COMPLETION OF DETENTION FACILITIES.
   Where detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are to be used as
part of the drainage system for a property, they shall be completed as part of
the mass grading for the site. No construction will be allowed beyond the mass
grading until the detention, retention, or depressional storage areas are
complete.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.41 FEE IN LIEU OF DETENTION.
   If because of the small size of a site, or other mitigating circumstances,
at the Village's discretion, a fee may be paid to the Village in lieu of
providing the required detention.
   (A)   Any development requiring a restrictor smaller than two (2) inches in
diameter to satisfy the release requirements in §
151.24 may be required to pay a fee. The fee would be equal to:
   = ($326,520) x (Theo. Vol.- Act. Vol.)
where the "Theoretical Volume" is the detention storage calculated using the
maximum allowable release rate per §
151.24, the "Actual Volume" is the detention storage calculated using the
release rate from a two (2) inch diameter, and the volumes are measured in
acre-feet. The Village shall also have the option of requiring a fee for each
acre-foot of detention storage needed in lieu of the applicant building a basin
on-site, provided the property will discharge stormwater to the Village's storm
sewer system.
   (B)   In instances where regional benefits and economies of scale can be
achieved, it may be permissible, and may be required, for the adjacent
properties to utilize a common regional detention basin. The applicant may have
the option of paying a fee based upon the ratio of acre-feet required for the
site to the total capacity of the regional facility, and reflecting the cost of
engineering, land, construction, landscaping, and maintenance of the detention
facility so that the Village can build regional facilities or applicants can
jointly build the necessary facilities themselves.

(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.51 VARIANCES.
   No variances shall be granted to any development located in a regulatory
floodway as defined in §
151.02. However, when a development proposal is located outside of a regulatory
floodway, and whenever the standards of this Section place undue hardship on a
specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the Chief Inspector,
Village Engineer, and Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (A)   Appeals and Administrative Decisions.  The Chief Inspector of
Inspectional Services and Village Engineer are charged with the duties of
review, inspection, and approval of structures and items subject to the
regulations contained in this Section. In the event that a property owner or
some third party is shown to be affected by said Chief Inspector's application
of the regulatory provisions contained herein, said person or persons may file
a written petition to the Chief Inspector, Zoning Board of Appeals, and Village
Engineer within 30 days setting forth the reasons challenged. In accordance
with existing procedures, the Chief Inspector, Zoning Board of Appeals, and
Village Engineer shall then conduct a hearing providing interested parties with
an opportunity to be heard. The Chief Inspector, Zoning Board of Appeals, and
Village Engineer shall then either approve, modify, or overrule the
determination of the Chief Inspector and Village Engineer, as applied to the
petitioning party or parties of interest.
   (B)   The Chief Inspector, Zoning Board of Appeals, and Village Engineer
shall forward a written summary of the action taken to the Village President
and Board of Trustees of the Village, setting forth the Chief Inspector's
findings and recommendations. The President and Board of Trustees shall act by
approving, modifying, reversing, or remanding the original decision.
   (C)   The President and Board of Trustees of the Village, after receiving
the findings and recommendations of the Chief Inspector, Zoning Board of
Appeals, and Village Engineer on a petition for a variance from the regulatory
standards of this Section filed before said Commission, may grant variances
from the regulatory standards of this Section in accordance with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Fee: All petitions for a variance submitted to the Chief Inspector,
Zoning Board of Appeals, and Village Engineer shall be accompanied by the
payment of a $200 fee to cover the administrative costs for the processing of
the petition, plus any additional costs incurred by the Village for engineering
review of the proposed variance.
      (2)   No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates
that:
         (a)   The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA;
         (b)   An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not
granted;
         (c)   The relief requested is the minimum necessary;
         (d)   There will be no additional threat to public health, safety,
beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation
of a nuisance;
         (e)   There will be no additional public expense for flood protection,
lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations,
policing, or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities, or other
public facilities;
         (f)   The provisions of §§
151.52 through
151.54 shall still be met;
         (g)   The activity is not in a regulatory floodway;
         (h)   The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a
general problem; and
         (i)   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential
character of the area involved, including existing stream uses.
      (3)   The Chief Inspector and Village Engineer shall notify an applicant
in writing that a variance from the requirements of §
151.54 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will:
         (a)   Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance coverage;
         (b)   Increase the risks to life and property; and
         (c)   Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of these
risks, and that the applicant will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the
risk and liability.

building listed on the Natural Register of Historical Places or documented as
worthy of preservation by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency may be
granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of this Section.
(Ord. 05-2528, passed 7-26-05)
§ 151.52 OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS.
   Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if
protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by
proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of
this Chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe
shall meet the requirements of this Section, along with the requirements of §
151.55.
   (A)   Development Permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body
not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without
first obtaining a development permit from the Chief Inspector.
   (B)   Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided
by the Chief Inspector. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the
site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description
for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor;
existing grade elevations in M.S.L., 1929 adj. datum or N.G.V.D. and all
changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and
dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed
buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest
adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will
be subject to the requirements of §
151.55 of this Chapter.
   (C)   Upon receipt of a development permit application, the Chief Inspector
shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher
than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map and which
has not been filled after the date of the site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map
without a permit as required by this Chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore,
not subject to the requirements of this Chapter. The Chief Inspector shall
maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site
and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the
site's first Flood Insurance Rate Map identification.
   (D)   A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be
submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
   (E)   The Chief Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
Chief Inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and
local permits have been obtained.
   (F)   Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the flood fringe shall
create a threat to public health and safety.
   (G)   If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and
obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing
the site from the floodplain.
   (H)   Compensatory Storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

of this Section.
      (15)   If the designated floodway delineation, base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation will change due to the proposed project, the
application will not be considered complete until DNR/OWR has indicated
conditional approval of the designated floodway map change. No structures may
be built until a Letter of Map Revision has been approved by FEMA.
      (16)   The application for a structure shall be accompanied by drawings
of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions and existing
ground elevations and all changes in grade resulting from any proposed
excavation or filling, and floodplain and floodway limits; sealed by a
registered professional engineer, licensed architect or registered land

   (C)   The Chief Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits and approvals
that may be required for this type of activity. The Chief Inspector shall not
issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have
been obtained. A Registered Professional Engineer, under the employ or contract
of the Village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this
Section.
   (D)   Preventing Increased Damages and a List of Appropriate Uses. The only
development in a floodway which will be allowed are Appropriate Uses, which
will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a
damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a
threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic
and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair
existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be
minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this Chapter. Only
those Appropriate Uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 will be allowed.
The approved Appropriate Uses are as follows:
      (1)   Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or
private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife.
      (2)   Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring
access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities,
and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial
shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
      (3)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
      (4)   Underground and overhead utilities;
      (5)   Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems,
including any related fencing (at least fifty percent (50%) open when viewed
from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and
including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that
will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (6)   Detached garages, storage sheds, or other non-habitable accessory
structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
      (7)   Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and
taxiways and any modification thereto;
      (8)   Parking lots and any modification thereto (where depth of flooding
at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot and aircraft
parking aprons built at or below ground elevations.
      (9)   Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive
non-erosive slope toward a watercourse.
      (10)   Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful
structures including the construction of water tight window wells, elevating
structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or
industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be
no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure,
and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure.
      (11)   The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building,
provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage
occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection
elevation.
      (12)   Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the
enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood
elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to,
fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the
building improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the
modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be
protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation.
      (13)   Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of
any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation
or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise non-appropriate uses in
the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a
fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an
Appropriate Use.
   (E)   Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps
designated by DNR/OWR, the construction of an Appropriate Use, will be
considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following
engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting
plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided
that any structure meets the protection requirements of §
151.55 of this Chapter:
      (1)   Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood
stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost
due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
         (a)   Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n"
is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open
Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York).
         (b)   The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and
proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be
maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a non-vegetative
land cover.
         (c)   Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations
of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to
DNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt
transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
            1.   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider
section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one
foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length.
            2.   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length.
            3.   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
            4.   Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections
with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway
delineation on adjacent properties.
            5.   All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located
perpendicular to flood flows.
      (2)   Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream
flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway
storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory
storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume
of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a
reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the
proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All
designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All designated
floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the
compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to DNR/OWR through a
determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the
compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally there shall be no
reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification,
unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure.
      (3)   Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream
erosion or flood heights. For all Appropriate Uses, except bridges or culverts
or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in
the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. In the case of bridges
or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water
in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the
structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use
of rip-rap or other design measures.
      (4)   Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway
approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream
flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for
all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the
upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or
within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the
design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded
flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood
stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact DNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
         (a)   The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be
calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in §
151.06 of this Chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA
Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed
using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge
Waterways calculation procedures.
         (b)   Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per division (E)
(2) of this Section.
         (c)   Velocity increases must be mitigated per division (E)(3) of this
Section.
         (d)   If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for
recreational or commercial navigation, a DNR/OWR permit must be received.
         (e)   The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge
showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be
submitted to DNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by subsection
(D) of this Section.
         (f)   All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be
designed per subsection (E)(8) of this Section.
      (5)   Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and
approach roads.
         (a)   The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or
modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and
including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of
flood damage.
         (b)   If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a
source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain,
the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the
structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
         (c)   The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is
a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 (Floodway Construction in
Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to DNR/OWR for review and concurrence
before a permit is issued.
      (6)   On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any
increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the
existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing
vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A
permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from DNR/
OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream
during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in
§
151.02 shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Adm. Code Part 702
(Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a
modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall
be demonstrated that:
         (a)   The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by
providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
         (b)   The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous
fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life
cycle, such as for spawning;
         (c)   The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water
quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank
slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin.
         (d)   A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the
upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as
minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants.
If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with
upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
         (e)   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
Section.
      (7)   Flood proofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial
structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the
existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction
shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building.
Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for
floodproofing activities.
      (8)   Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the
design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and
replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for
lost conveyance or other Appropriate Uses, transition sections shall be
provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios
shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to DNR/OWR through
engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be
used with the same efficiency:
         (a)   When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section,
the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length;
         (b)   When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section,
the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and
         (c)   When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a
minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length
shall be used.
         (d)   Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and
downstream of the transition sections.
      (9)   If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall
be demonstrated that:
         (a)   There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which
would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the
body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank
stabilization, flood proofing of existing structures, removal of structures
from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the
establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification
is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water
quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
         (b)   Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be
significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may
be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent
degree of natural resource values;
         (c)   The activity has been planned and designed and will be
constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural
conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following
criteria:
            1.   The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall
match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-
section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously
modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
            2.   Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both
the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
            3.   One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when
feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one
side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization
effects of the vegetation.
            4.   Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that
which is essential for construction of the channel.
            5.   Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no
steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank
stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of
alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as
concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
            6.   All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be
seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to
stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
            7.   If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity
such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow
characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where
appropriate.
            8.   A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of
the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
            9.   New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all
items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to
diversion of water into the new channel.
            10.   There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the
channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless
necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is
justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
            11.   Unless the modification is for a public flood control
project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage
outside the floodway as a result of the modification.
            12.   The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this
Section.
      (10)   Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a
floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
      (11)   Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the
floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is
potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control
measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
         (a)   The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum
vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil
is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be
destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of
improvements.
         (b)   Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied
to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the
site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but
will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days.
         (c)   Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any
significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement
of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control
devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
         (d)   A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be
preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see
subsection (E)(15) of this Section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall
be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary,
to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be
restabilized immediately.
         (e)   Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be
designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the
"Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).
      (12)   Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects,
the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the
applicant can demonstrate to DNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively
result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
      (13)   General criteria for analysis of flood elevations.
         (a)   The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated
floodway study, referenced in §
151.06, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, DNR/OWR shall be contacted
for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
         (b)   If the 100-year designated floodway elevation at the site of the
proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving
stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to
meet: The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood
elevations of the designated floodway conditions and conditions with the
receiving stream at normal water elevations.
         (c)   If the applicant learns from DNR/OWR, local governments, or a
private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to
be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is
scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five
years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the
requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected
flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is
built.
      (14)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision. If the Appropriate Use would
result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year
frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to DNR/OWR and FEMA all
information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional
designated floodway map revision and receive from DNR/OWR a conditional
concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. The
final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans
or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating
activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and DNR/OWR. In the case of non-
government projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in
unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated
floodway map revision before DNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling,
grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval
is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no
activities shall take place until a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is
issued by FEMA with concurrence from DNR/OWR.
      (15)   Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses
shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional
engineer.
      (16)   For all activities in the floodway involving construction within
25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met:
         (a)   A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least 25 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
         (b)   Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the
construction of an Appropriate Use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
      (17)   After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway
change and issuance of a permit and a Conditional Letter of Map Revision,
construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no
buildings or structures or other construction that is not an Appropriate Use
may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a
final Letter of Map Revision is received. The designated floodway map will be
revised upon acceptance and concurrence by DNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as-built"
plans.
   (F)   State Review. For those projects listed below located in a designated
floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to DNR/OWR for their review
and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit.
      (1)   An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed
bridge pursuant to division (E)(4) of this Section.
      (2)   An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert
crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the
proposed flood profile, pursuant to subsection (E)(5) of this Section.
      (3)   Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent
storage pursuant to subsections (E)(1), (E)(2) and (E)(8) of this Section.
      (4)   The construction of any DNR/OWR projects, dams (as defined in §
151.02) and all other state, federal, or local units of government projects,
including projects of the municipality or county.
      (5)   An engineer's determination that a proposed bridge affected by
backwater from a downstream receiving stream may be built with a smaller
opening.
      (6)   Projects which revise or establish the floodway and/or flood
profiles.
      (7)   Projects in public bodies of water.
   (G)   Other Permits. In addition to the other requirements of this Chapter,
a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued
unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a
permit is not required from DNR/OWR, issued pursuant to ILCS Ch. 615, Act 5, §§
5 et seq. No permit from DNR/OWR shall be required if DNR/OWR has delegated
this responsibility to the Village.
   (H)   Permits for Dams. Any work involving the construction, modification or
removal of a dam as defined in §
151.02 per 92 III. Adm. Code Part 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain a DNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
Chief Inspector finds a dam that does not have a DNR/OWR permit, the Chief
Inspector shall immediately notify the DNR/OWR Schaumburg office. If the Chief
Inspector finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Chief
Inspector shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the DNR/OWR Schaumburg
office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
   (I)   [Intentionally omitted.]
   (J)   Activities That Do Not Require a Registered Professional Engineer's
Review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered
professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other
requirements of this Chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
      (1)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
         (a)   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or
         (b)   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the
floodway, or
         (c)   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe
or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing streambed,
and
         (d)   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the estimated
100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of an
existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting towers
shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not catch
debris.
         (e)   Disturbance of streamside vegetation prevent erosion and
sedimentation. All disturbed floodway areas, including the stream banks shall
be restored to their original contours and seeded or otherwise stabilized upon
completion of construction.
         (f)   A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water
pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5
(1992 State Bar Edition) shall be provided with shut-off valves on each side of
the body of water to be crossed.
         (g)   All Illinois Commerce Commission, National Electric Safety
Codes, and federal requirements for clearance must be met.
      (2)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls that:
         (a)   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope, and
         (b)   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation,

§ 151.54 OCCUPATION AND USE OF SFHA AREAS WHERE FLOODWAYS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED.
   In SFHA or floodplains, (including AE, AH, AO and Unnumbered A Zones) where
no floodways have been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevations have been established by FEMA, and draining more than a square mile,
no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the
proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and
structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of
the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation.
   (A)   Development Permit. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm,
corporation, or governmental body, not exempted by state law, shall commence
any development in a SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development
permit from the Chief Inspector. Application for a development permit shall be
made on a form provided by the Chief Inspector. The application shall be
accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line
dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting
from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or
surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to
buildings; and the elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) of all
proposed buildings subject to the requirements of §
151.55 of this Chapter. The application for a development permit shall also
include the following information:
      (1)   A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose, and
intended use;
      (2)   Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn
to scale, on the designated floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to
be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
      (3)   Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of activity;
      (4)   Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a
minimum:
         (a)   A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the
waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic
or numerical scale, and north arrow;
         (b)   A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing
existing and proposed conditions including principal dimensions of the
structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929 adjustment) datum or
N.G.V.D., adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the
proposed construction is in or near a commercially navigable body of water),
floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross-sections, north arrow, and
a graphical or numerical scale;
         (c)   Cross-section views of the project perpendicular to the flow of
floodwater and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions
including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and
proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation,
100-year frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales
(horizontal and vertical); and
         (d)   A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed
areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be
implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the
identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance.
      (5)   Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted
showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection (D) of this
Section.
      (6)   Any and all other federal, state, and local permits or approvals
that may be required for this type of development.
   (B)   Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois
State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository, the Chief Inspector
shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the
developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to §
151.06(D). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been
higher than the base flood elevation of the current Flood Insurance Rate Map
Identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the
requirements of this Chapter. The Chief Inspector shall maintain documentation
of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that
this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first Flood
Insurance Rate Map identification.
   (C)   The Chief Inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or
permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The
Chief Inspector shall not issue the development permit unless all required
federal, state, and local permits have been obtained.
   (D)   Preventing Increased Damages. No development in the SFHA, where a
floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially
damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health,
safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of
the floodway or channel, or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as
called for in this Chapter.
   (E)   Within all riverine SFHA's where the floodway has not been determined,
the following standards shall apply:
      (1)   The developer shall have a Registered Professional Engineer state
in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations, and data that the
project meets the engineering requirements of §
151.53(E)(1) through (11) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the
provisions of §
151.06(D) of this Chapter. As an alternative, the developer should have an
engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering
study to DNR/OWR for acceptance as a designated floodway. Upon acceptance of
the floodway by DNR/OWR, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project
meets the requirements of §
151.53 for the designated floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to
the definition in §
151.02 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first
obtains a permit from DNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is not
required from DNR/OWR.
      (3)   No permit from DNR/OWR shall be required if DNR/OWR has delegated
permit responsibility to the Village per 92 Ill. Adm. Code, Part 708 for
designated floodways.
      (4)   Permits for dams. Any work involving the construction, modification
or removal of a dam as defined in §
151.02 per 92 Ill. Adm. Code, Part 702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall
obtain a DNR/OWR permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
Chief Inspector finds a dam that does not have a DNR/OWR permit, the Chief
Inspector shall immediately notify the DNR/OWR Schaumburg office. If the Chief
Inspector finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the Chief
Inspector shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the DNR/OWR Schaumburg
office, and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA).
      (5)   The following activities may be permitted without a Registered
Professional Engineer's review or calculation of a base flood elevation and
designated floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of
this Chapter:
         (a)   Underground and overhead utilities that:
            1.   Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations,
or
            2.   Do not require the placement of above ground structures in the
floodway, or
            3.   In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the
pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of 3 feet below the existing streambed,
and
            4.   Overhead utility lines shall be constructed above the
estimated 100-year frequency flood elevation or attached above the low chord of
an existing bridge (with the permission of the bridge owner). No supporting
towers shall be placed in the watercourse and shall be designed so as to not
catch debris.
            5. Disturbance of streamside vegetation shall be kept to minimum
during construction to prevent erosion and sedimentation.
            6.   A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water
pollution as defined by the Environmental Protection Act, ILCS Ch. 415, Act 5
(1992 State Bar Edition) shall be provided with shut-off valves on each side of
the body of water to be crossed.
            7.   All Illinois Commerce Commission, National Electric Safety
Codes, and federal requirements for clearance must be met.
         (b)   Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls that:
            1.   Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent
natural bank slope, and
            2.   Do not result in an increase in ground elevation, and
            3.   Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall
location.
         (c)   Construction of shoreline and streambank protection that:
            1.   Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
            2.   Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
            3.   Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional
area of the stream channel by more than ten percent (10%).
            4.   Stabilization utilizing native vegetation and gradual side
slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems.
Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural
rock or rip-rap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete,
construction rubble, and gabions should be avoided unless there are no
practicable alternatives.
         (d)   Temporary stream crossings in which:
            1.   The approach roads will be 1/2 foot or less above natural
grade.
            2.   The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up
the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or
outfall invert.
            3.   The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least 2
feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be non-
erosive material, such as rip-rap or gravel.
            4.   All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise
stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of
construction.
            5.   The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within
one year after authorization.

located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building, and which
do extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the
flow of flood waters;
         (j)   Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
            1.   The affected length of stream is less than 1,000 feet.
            2.   The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream
channels, or
            3.   The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to
that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site.
      (6)   The flood carrying capacity within any altered or relocated
watercourse shall be maintained.
   (F)   Compensatory Storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is
authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the
authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent
volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the
volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and
watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas
so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall
be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial
damage from a flood, the top of the lowest floor shall be elevated to or above
the flood protection elevation.
            2.   In the case of manufactured homes placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, the manufactured
home shall be elevated so that either the top of the lowest floor is above the
base flood elevation or the chassis is at least 36 inches in height above grade
and supported by reinforced piers or other foundations of equivalent strength,
whichever is less.
         (f)   Recreational vehicles or travel trailers shall be required to
meet the elevation and anchoring requirements of subsection (C)(2)(e) of this
Section unless:
            1.   They are on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and,
            2.   They are fully licensed and ready for highway use. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utility and
service devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
            3.   Only a non-residential building may be structurally dry
floodproofed (in lieu of elevation) provided that: a registered professional
engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed
below the flood protection elevation, the structure and attendant utility
facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account
flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces,
the effects of buoyancy, and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures
shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of
electricity (levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered
floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection).
            4.   Existing buildings located within a designated floodway shall
also meet the more restrictive Appropriate Use standards included in §
151.53. Non-conforming structures located in a designated floodway may remain
in use and may only be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered in accordance
with §
151.53(D). A non-conforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other
natural or man-made disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of its market value before it was damaged, in which case it shall
conform to this Chapter.

   The owner of any land which is within the corporate limits of the Village,
or unincorporated land which is located within one and one-half miles of the
corporate limits, who proposes to subdivide such land into lots of record or
consolidate into a single Lot of Record, or who proposes to dedicate streets,
alleys or other lands for public use, shall cause a plat to be prepared in
accordance with the regulations of this Chapter, unless otherwise excepted.
Replats and resubdivisions shall conform to these regulations. However, before
undertaking the formal procedures outlined in this Subdivision Code, an
applicant is urged to submit a tentative plat and discuss the proposal with the
Director and Village Engineer to ascertain the requirements affecting the
subdivision.
   (A)   Whenever the owner of land subdivides or plats any land located within
the corporate limits of the Village, such activity shall come within the
jurisdiction of this Chapter, said land shall be surveyed and a plat made
thereof by an Illinois registered land surveyor containing information required
hereinafter; and all such plats shall be submitted to the Village pursuant to
the provisions of this Chapter.
   (B)   No lot or tract of land shall be divided or redivided or in any manner

Article II.
Design Standards — All Subdivisions
§ 153.201. MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Every subdivision plat shall comply with the terms and conditions of the
Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance and this Chapter, with the exception
that any plat which has received preliminary approval shall be exempt from any
subsequent amendments to the Zoning Ordinance, rendering the plat non-
conforming as to bulk, provided that approval of the final plat is obtained
within one (1) year from the date of preliminary approval. In addition, the
plat shall meet the minimum design standards outlined below. Immediately
following receipt of an application for the approval of a subdivision, the
Village Clerk shall forward copies of the entire application with all
supporting documentation to the Director of Community Development, Village
Engineer and the Corporation Counsel for their review and analyses.
   (A)   Lots.
      (1)   Lot shapes. Every lot shall have four sides. Exceptions may be
approved when the applicant demonstrates that a four-sided lot is not feasible
because of peculiar topographical conditions, abutting lots of record or
abutting parcels not owned directly or indirectly by the applicant, or pre-
existing buildings not owned directly or indirectly by the applicant. A lot of
other than four sides will not be approved if it appears that such lot has been
so formed solely to comply with the minimum area, depth and width requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance. As nearly as practicable, intersecting lot lines shall
form right angles with each other.
      (2)   Lot Depths, Area and Widths. The size and orientation of lots shall
be appropriate for the type of development and use contemplated. Generally,
each lot shall have principal frontage upon an adjacent public right-of-way and
side lot lines shall be drawn as nearly as possible perpendicularly to the
adjacent right-of-way line for the public right-of-way. In addition, all lots
shall comply with all the requirements of the zoning district in which located.
Residential lots, in general, shall not be less than one hundred thirty feet
(130') feet in depth nor less than fifty feet (50') in width from the right-of-
way line to the building line, however nothing herein shall be interpreted as
relieving any owner from complying with minimum lot width and area requirements
at the building line as determined by the applicable zoning district.
      (3)   Conformance with Zoning Ordinance.
         (a)   Existing Structures. A subdivision shall not be approved when
said subdivision places an existing permanent structure in violation of the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and/or the minimum design standards of
this Chapter.
         (b)   Fractional Tracts. A subdivision shall not be approved when said
subdivision places an existing adjacent tract of land in nonconformity with
requirements of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance and/or the minimum
design standards of this Chapter.
      (4)   Relationship to Streets. Each lot shall have principal frontage on
a street. Through lots are prohibited.
      (5)   The regulations contained in this subsection shall not apply to
real property developed as a planned development or a planned unit development,
except that a subdivision shall not be approved when said subdivision places an
existing adjacent tract of land in nonconformity with requirements of the
Compre-hensive Plan, the Zoning Ordinance and/or the minimum design standards
of this Chapter.
   (B)   Streets and Pedestrian Ways. The plat of the proposed subdivision
shall provide for dedication of the necessary land for public streets proposed
by the plat and projected by the Comprehensive Plan. Where streets and alleys
abut a subdivision and are indicated by the Comprehensive Plan to be widened,
land shall be dedicated to provide one-half the required right-of-way width as
measured from the required centerline of such street or alley. In general,
blocks shall not exceed one thousand two hundred feet (1,200') in length with a
practical maximum being one thousand feet (1,000'). Block lengths and width
shall be coordinated with the development of the land and shall be provided in
a manner that will allow the proper traffic flow and pedestrian use.
      (1)   Width of Rights-of-way. Width of street and alley rights-of-way
shall be as shown in the Comprehensive Plan for Major Streets; provided,
however, that minimum right-of-way widths shall be as follows.
         (a)   Major arterial streets: 100 feet.
         (b)   Minor arterial streets: 80 feet.
         (c)   Minor private and all other streets: 66 feet.
      (2)   Street Relationships, Connections, and Dead-end Streets (Cul-de-
sacs).
         (a)   As the same may be amended from time to time, the Comprehensive
Plan shall govern consideration of the arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade and location of streets. All streets shall be considered in their
relation to existing and planned streets, topographical and soil conditions,
public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of the land to be served.
         (b)   Generally, the arrangement of streets within a subdivision shall
make provision for the continuation of existing or proposed streets in
adjoining areas and, when a new subdivision adjoins land susceptible of being
subdivided or resubdivided, new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of
the tract proposed to be subdivided.
         (c)   Whenever, in the opinion of the President and Board of Trustees,
topography, State highways, rivers, water courses, or other physical conditions
require the platting and establishment of dead-end streets, such streets shall
have adequate width for turn around, which may include cul-de-sacs having a
radius of no less than forty feet (40') from center of cul-de-sac to outside
edge of pavement to ensure that emergency vehicles can access all lots fronting
upon the dead-end street within a reasonable amount of time.
         (d)   Streets in or near Floodways. Streets platted near and/or within
floodways shall be located in compliance with the storm water management
ordinances of the Village. In all instances, the elevation of street and
driveway pavement shall be at least one foot (1') above flood protection
elevations.
         (e)   Streets Along Railroads. The nearest right-of-way line of

      (3)   Street construction shall conform with the State of Illinois
Department of Transportation standards for roadway construction and, in
addition:
         (a)   Pavement Width:  Minimum pave- ment widths on all streets is
thirty-two feet (32') back-to-back of curbs on local streets and forty feet
(40') on major collectors and streets serving industrial and commercial
property. Greater pavement width requirements shall be based on the function of
the particular street in accordance with the Traffic Plan.
         (b)   Half Streets: In the event any proposed street right-of-way is
at the edge of a subdivision and only half the proposed right-of-way (a minimum
of 33 feet) falls within the subdivision the road will be built to allow two
(2) moving lanes of traffic (24 feet of pavement) as a minimum. In the event
the road benefits primarily the subdivider, the Zoning, Planning and Appeals
Commission may recommend full right-of-way width dedication and/or full
improvement of the road.
         (c)   Frontage Streets:  Where deemed necessary, the Zoning, Planning
and Appeals Commission may recommend access streets be required to service
areas fronting on major thoroughfares.

dedications of rights-of-way or easements of the land necessary for bicycle
paths, other greenways, such storm or flood water run-off channels and basins,
ways for public facilities, parks, playgrounds, school grounds and other public
grounds as may be required by the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission to
conform to the principles set forth in the Compre-hensive Plan. In addition,
any public grounds designated on the Comprehensive Plan which lie within a
proposed subdivision shall be dedicated for the use intended in the
Comprehensive Plan.
   (D)   Utility and Drainage Easements. The plat of the proposed subdivision
shall provide for dedications of easements of sufficient widths to provide
subdivided lots with utility services; however in no event shall such an
easement be less than twenty feet (20') in width. Where practicable, such
easements shall be located at the rear and sides of each lot so as to provide
continuity of alignment of such easements from block to block. The plat of the
proposed subdivision shall also provide for dedications of easements necessary
for storm or flood water run-off channels and basins. In addition:
      (1)   Sanitary Sewer Service: Sanitary sewer mains capable of being
connected to the Village sani-tary sewage system shall be constructed to
Village standards throughout the entire subdivision in such manner as to serve
adequately all lots.
      (2)   Water Supply and Distribution: Water mains including shut-off
valves and fire hydrants shall be constructed to Village standards throughout

hydrant; b) at intervals not exceeding three hundred feet (300') in commercial,
industrial and multi-family (quads and larger) areas.
      (3)   Electric, Telephone and Cable Television Service:  Electric,
telephone and cable television service to all lots in the subdivision will be
provided underground and in accordance with Village standards. Electrical
transformers and telephone and cable television junction boxes shall not be

drainage easements. A minimum ten foot (10') easement will be provided for any
drainage facility which collects or transports storm water drainage over one
(1) or two (2) individual lots. A drainage easement shall be granted for all
areas designated on the final plat as retention or detention in the drainage
plans of the subdivision. An easement of a minimum of five feet by five feet
(5' x 5') offset from any drainage facility and outside any easement required
for drainage shall be provided for electrical transformers and telephone
junction centers. All required easements shall be shown on the final
subdivision plat. Easements required by this subsection may also be used for
the installation of utility facilities which do not interfere with the use of
the easements for drainage purposes.

      (7)   Final Grading and Top of Foundation Plans: At the time of final
plat approval the subdivider shall submit for approval by the Village Engineer,
a lot grading and foundation elevation plan. It shall show at each lot corner
the proposed U.S.G.S. elevation for that point. Arrows drawn along all lot
lines shall show the direction of drainage flow. The top of the foundation
shall be shown by a U.S.G.S. elevation. That elevation shall be noted inside
the symbol for the structure location on the lot. Where there is more than one
foundation level for the structure, the elevation for the lowest foundation
level shall be shown. The foundation elevation shall be such that the lot
drainage be designed to run away from the top of the foundation. In the event
conditions dictate that some parts of the lot be higher than the structure
foundation, the grading plan will show specific drainage configurations for the
lot specifying that all drainage is directed away from the foundation.
      (8)   Engineering and Inspection: Improvements for sanitary sewer, water
main, storm sewer, road, concrete curb and gutter, electric street lighting
lines, electrical distribution system, drainage, and appurtenances thereto,
shall be submitted to the Village Engineer for approval before final approval

by the Village Engineer. No material shall be moved from or placed on any lot
which obstructs, retards or changes the direction of the natural flow of water.
   (F)   Special Standards for Lots-in-depth.
      (1)   In the “R1”, and “R2” single family residential districts, whenever
a proposed subdivision provides for the division of an existing parcel of land,
one or more lots-in-depth may be permitted provided dividing the parcel in
question into conventional lots, each having full frontage upon a street, is
impossible because of lot configuration or natural features located on the land
within the proposed subdivision, such as watercourses, State highways, or
parks.
      (2)   Provided the proposed subdivision meets the above requirements, a
lot-in-depth must conform to the following additional requirements:
         (a)   The lot-in-depth shall have frontage upon an existing street by
means of its Stem, which shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide, containing a
minimum twelve foot (12') wide driveway.
         (b)   Minimum four foot (4') wide land- scape buffers shall be
provided: (i) adjacent to adjoin-ing properties on both sides of the Stem; and
(ii) within the Stem. In order to assure visual clearance at the street, the
shrub screen and groundcover plantings located in these buffers and within ten
feet (10') of the edge of pavement shall meet the approval of the Village
Engineer prior to the issuance of an occupancy certificate by the Village for
structures located on the lot-in-depth.
         (c)   No building or other structure shall be placed or constructed
upon any part of the Stem.
         (d)   Exclusive of the entire area of the Stem, the entire remaining
area included within any permitted lot-in-depth shall contain one hundred
percent (100%) of the minimum lot area for conventional lots in any such zoning
district.
         (e)   Upon its review of a plat containing a lot-in-depth, the Zoning,
Planning and Appeals Commission shall require building setback lines from all
lot lines to be installed upon the platted area of the lot-in-depth. The
minimum required building setback lines of a lot-in-depth shall be dependent
upon the required zoning yards of any other lots adjacent to such lot-in-depth.
Where a lot-in-depth abuts a front or rear yard of an adjacent lot, the
required building setback lines shall be located away from the lot line a
distance equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the required abutting
front or rear yard. Where a lot-in-depth abuts a side yard, the required
building setback lines shall be located away from the lot line a distance equal
to one hundred percent (100%) of the required abutting side yard.
         (f)   Lots-in-depth shall conform to all other applicable regulations
of this Subdivision Code.
   (G)   Unbuildable Parcels. A subdivision shall not create or include
“outlots” or unsubdivided parcels. In addition, no subdivision shall include a
portion of a Lot of Record, without including the entire Lot of Record unless,
prior to the date of adoption of this Chapter the portion of the Lot of Record
not included in the subject subdivision has been under separate ownership from
the portion of the Lot of Record included in the subject subdivision.

(Ord. 02-2348, passed 7-9-02)
§ 153.402.  MAJOR SUBDIVISION, FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Filing deadline. Within one (1) year after the date of the approval of
the preliminary plat by the President and Board of Trustees, the subdivider
shall submit to the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission the final plat of a
Major Subdivision for approval and recording as described hereinbelow.
      (1)   Time Extensions. Upon the request of the subdivider made within the
first two hundred seventy (270) days following the date of the approval of the
preliminary plat as aforesaid, and for good cause shown, the Zoning, Planning
and Appeals Commission may extend the time for submitting the final plat for
approval for an additional ninety (90) days, provided that only one such
extension may be granted with respect to any given subdivision proposal.
      (2)   Revocation of Preliminary Plat Approval. The subdivider's failure
to submit a final plat to the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission for
approval within the time or extension thereof set forth above shall operate as
an automatic revocation of the approval of the preliminary plat, and the
subsequent subdivision of the same property shall proceed only upon application
to the Village as set forth herein for original applications.
   (B)   Filing Requirements for Final Plat of Major Subdivision. These
requirements are cumulative to and augment the filing requirements for a
preliminary plat of a Major Subdivision. At the time of filing of final plat of
Major Subdivision, the subdivider shall submit an engineering, drainage and
grading plan containing detailed plans and specifications along with a natural
resource opinion, theretofore approved by the Village Engineer, for the
installation, construction and design of all Bonded Improvements, including but
not limited to street pavements, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and pathways, fire
hydrants, water mains, storm sewers and storm water storage facilities, street
lights and other Bonded Improvements detailing the existing centerline
elevations of all streets and alleys in the proposed subdivision and the
centerline elevations of proposed pavements [Elevations shall refer to U.S.G.S.
datum]. Profiles shall be drawn to a horizontal scale of not more than one inch
equals 50 feet and vertical scale of not less than one inch equals five feet,
which plans and profiles shall be prepared by an engineer licensed by the State
of Illinois in accord with all applicable codes and ordinances of the Village
as well as with the more detailed regulations contained below:
      (1)   All proper certificates and seals as required by law shall be shown
on the subdivision plat including the signature and seal of the Illinois
registered land surveyor who prepared the plat.
      (2)   No engineering, drainage, and grading plan shall be deemed approved
unless the certificate of the Village Engineer is reflected thereon, certifying
that the Bonded Improvements described thereon in the owner/subdivider
statement and the plan meet the minimum requirements of this Chapter and all
other applicable ordinances of the Village, which certificate shall include the
Village Engineer's estimate of the cost of such improvements, as well as the
costs of engineering and inspection.
   (C)   Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission Recommendation. Provided the
final plat meets the conditions (if any) set forth upon which the preliminary
plat had been approved and is otherwise in accord with the preliminary plat and
with all applicable regulations of this Subdivision Code, the Chairman will
make and send the President and Board of Trustees a written report containing
the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission recommendation.
   (D)   Subdivider's Agreement.  At the time of the approval of any final plat
of a Major Subdivision, the plat shall not be signed by the Village President
or attested by the Village Clerk until the President and Board of Trustees
shall be in receipt of the subdivider's written agreement in form approved by
the Corporation Counsel wherein the subdivider agrees to install and construct
all Bonded Improvements in accord with all applicable Codes and ordinances of
the Village; to establish responsibility for operation and maintenance of the
detention area in an owners' association or other private entity pursuant to a
declaration of covenants approved as part of the subdivider's agreement; to pay
all required fees in accordance with the requirements of the ordinances of the
Village, and to make all required donations and financial guarantees including
reimbursement of the fees and charges of the Corporation Counsel. While a
subdivider's agreement may be amended (by mutual agreement of the subdivider
and the President and Board of Trustees) to extend the time for commencing and
completing Bonded Improvements, the subdivider's agreement shall contain the
approximate date when installation of Bonded Improvements will commence and a
reasonable date for completion of said Bonded Improvements, subject to the
condition that the improvements shall be completed within two (2) years of the
date of the President and Board of Trustees' approval of the final Major
Subdivision plat. This agreement shall include but not be limited to statements
acknowledging:
      (1)   That the subdivider may freely assign, transfer or convey property
within a platted sub-division, but such assignment, transfer or conveyance
shall not affect the principal obligation of the subdivider to perform the
obligations set forth in the subdivider's agreement, which shall bind the
assignees and successors in interest of the subdivider;
      (2)   That Bonded Improvements associated with building permits for model
homes must be constructed and installed in accordance with applicable
ordinances of the Village;
      (3)   That the subdivider will pay all attorney's fees and other costs
incurred by the Village in enforcing collection of such surety in the event
that the subdivider fails to honor the Village's demand for payment under the
terms of such surety;
      (4)   That no building permit associated with a lot in a Major
Subdivision shall be issued until the following Bonded Improvements are
constructed and approved for use: Street pavement systems, bituminous base,
asphalt binder course, and street inlets; storm sewers and detention systems;
and water systems;
      (5)   That no partial certificate of occupancy associated with a lot in a
Major Subdivision shall be issued until grading of the street parkways across
the frontage of the subject lot and final grading and installation of top soil,
seeding/sod, and landscaping of the common areas in the entire Major
Subdivision have been completed and installed.
      (6)   That the Bonded Improvements pro- posed to be made in the
subdivision shall be con-structed and installed, and public improvements
accepted by the President and Board of Trustees, prior to the occupancy of any
building constructed upon the subdivided lots therein; and
      (7)   That no utilities located within the subdivision shall be connected
to the sewer and water utilities belonging to the Village except in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Municipal Code and upon payment of the
connection fees required therein.
      (8)   Financial Guarantee. Within fifteen (15) days of the President and
Board of Trustees' approval of any final Plat of Subdivision, the owner/
subdivider must deposit a suitable financial surety with the Village to
guarantee completion of all Bonded Improvements as determined by the Village
Engineer in accordance with the subdivider's agreement and the ordinances of
the Village, together with all other commitments made by the subdivider, by
submitting a surety in the form of either a letter of credit (in a form to be
approved by the Corporation Counsel), or subdivision bond, or cash. Any such
letter of credit must be irrevocable and made by a sound and reputable bank
whereby a sum of money is set aside and restricted as payment for the
performance of specific obligations by the subdivider.
         (a)   The surety submitted in accordance with this Subsection to
guarantee the completion of Bonded Improvements shall be in an amount equal to
one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the Village Engineer's estimated cost of
installing and constructing said Bonded Improvements and shall provide as
follows:
            i.   An expiration date not less than two years from the date of
issuance or an express provision that such surety will not expire prior to
completion and acceptance of said Bonded Improvements by the President and
Board of Trustees;
            ii.   That the financial or insurance company issuing the surety
shall give written notice by certified or registered mail to the Village Clerk
not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the surety, which surety
shall not expire absent such notice;
            iii.   That failure of the subdivider to complete the Bonded
Improvements secured by such surety prior to the scheduled completion date
shall be considered a default by the subdivider and the issuing institution;
            iv.   That failure of the subdivider to submit a successor surety
in accordance with
this Subsection to be effective upon expiration of the subject surety shall be
considered a default by the subdivider and the issuing institution;
            v.   That the surety shall be irrevocable;
            vi.   That (in the case of a payout instrument) the principal
amount of the instrument will not be discharged or reduced by the issuer except
upon written certificate of the Village President that such surety may be
discharged or reduced in a specified amount in accordance with Paragraph (c)
below; and
            vii.   That the issuer will pay all attorney's fees and other costs
incurred by the Village in enforcing collection of such surety in the event
that the issuer fails to honor the Village's demand for payment under the terms
of such surety.
         (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a standby surety submitted in
accordance with this Subsection to guarantee the completion of Bonded
Improvements may be reduced or partially discharged prior to completion and
acceptance of such Bonded Improvements in the sole discretion of the President
and Board of Trustees as follows:
            i.   Provided he approves of the installation of any given
improvement, following his inspection and review of the installation of the
Bonded Improvements and usual and customary waivers of lien attendant thereto,
the Village Engineer shall recommend reduction of the surety to the President
and Board of Trustees; and
            ii.   Upon its receipt of the recommendation of the Village
Engineer, the said President and Board of Trustees may authorize the reduction
of said surety — it being understood in any event that fifteen percent (15%) of
one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of such Bonded Improvements shall be
retained in the surety, as and for the maintenance guarantee to be held by the
Village for the two year period following approval and acceptance of the
improvements by the President and Board of Trustees.
         (c)   In the event the surety submitted in accordance with this
Subsection to guarantee the completion of the bonded improvement is a “pay-out”
instrument, it is understood that such surety shall be reduced periodically to
reflect payment by the subdivider for the Bonded Improvements as follows:
            i.   Provided he approves of the installation of any given bonded
improvement, the Village Engineer, following his inspection and review of the
installation of the Bonded Improvements and usual and customary waivers of lien
attendant thereto, shall recommend reduction of the surety to the Village
President; and
            ii.   Upon his receipt of the recommendation of the Village
Engineer, the said Village President may authorize the reduction of said surety
— it being understood in any event that fifteen percent (15%) of one hundred
percent (100%) of the cost of such Bonded Improvements shall be retained in the
surety, as and for the maintenance guarantee to be held by the Village for two
years following the acceptance of the Bonded Improvements by the President and
Board of Trustees.
         (d)   In the event a surety submitted in accordance with this
Subsection shall be discharged upon acceptance by the President and Board of
Trustees of all Bonded Improvements for which said surety or bond was
submitted, a maintenance guarantee (in form of cash, bond, or letter or credit)
guaranteeing said improvements against defects in materials or workmanship in
the amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the actual costs of said improvements
shall be deposited with the Village by the owner/subdivider to be effective for
a period of two years from the date of such acceptance of said Bonded
Improvements.
   (E)   President and Board of Trustees Consideration. Upon receipt of a
recommendation from the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission, such final
plat of Major Subdivision shall be acted upon by the President and Board of
Trustees. If said plat is approved by the President and Board of Trustees, it
is understood that such approval is conditioned upon the owner/subdivider
depositing the financial guarantee and executing the subdivider's agreement in
the form approved by the Corporation Counsel, unless noted to the contrary by
the President and Board of Trustees.
(Ord. 02-2348, passed 7-9-02)
§ 153.403 AVOIDANCE OF PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURES.
   An applicant may waive the right to preliminary approval process and may
instead file all of the data required in this Article for such approval at the
same time as such applicant files engineering plans and the final plat. The
preliminary and final plat may then be filed and approved simultaneously if all
requirements hereof are met. Provided, if desired by the subdivider, the final
plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which
the Subdivider proposes to record and develop at that time, and provided
further that if the development be staged, all staged final plats shall conform
substantially to the preliminary plat as approved. Approval for the final plat
may be submitted in stages with each stage reflecting a portion of the approved
preliminary plat which is proposed to be recorded and developed; provided,
however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations.
The final plat shall be essentially in accord with the preliminary plat.
However, before undertaking the formal procedures outlined in this Subdivision
Code, an applicant is urged to submit a tentative plat and discuss the proposal
with the Director and the Village Engineer to ascertain the requirements
affecting the subdivision.

§ 154.098 VARIATIONS AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Authorization of variations.
      (1)   All requests for variations in requirements herein set forth or
appeals from any rulings of any officer of the Village shall be directed to the
Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission of the Village, and following its
receipt of the recommendation of the said Zoning, Planning, and Appeals
Commission, the decision of the President and Board of Trustees shall be final
with regard to any such request.
      (2)   The Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission, after a public
hearing, may recommend that the President and Board of Trustees vary the
regulations of this chapter in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this chapter so that such variances as may be granted shall be granted by
ordinance and will not be contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, such
variances may be authorized only in those specific instances involving size,
shape, topography, and/or location upon the lot upon which the sign is proposed
to be placed, as set forth in the application for sign variation and then only
after the said Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission has made findings of
facts based upon the standards set forth in division (D) of this section, which
findings indicate that, owing to specific conditions, a literal enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter will produce practical difficulties or a
particular hardship for the petitioner, in such an individual case.
   (B)   Special exceptions.
      (1)   Intent.
         (a)   It is the intent of this chapter to encourage well-designed
signs which are compatible with their surroundings. There are certain types of
signs which are not in common use throughout the Village or which may be
peculiar to a particular type of activity, and which may be deemed to be
desirable, under controlled circumstances, or for the public convenience. Under
the general regulations of this chapter, however, such signs may not be
generally permitted or may be restricted in such a manner as to affect the
utility of such signs.
         (b)   Additionally, it is recognized that the size of the signs which
provide adequate identification in the more pedestrian-oriented or business
district differs from that necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where the
traffic is heavier, travel speeds are higher, and the required setback is
greater. Thus, instances may occur where strict application of the provisions
of this chapter may deprive a person of the reasonable use of a sign.
         (c)   This division provides means of approval of special exceptions
to the provisions of this chapter whereby specified deviations from the general
sign regulations may be allowed in order to permit such signs, without need of
proof of hardship, provided that the proposed size, location, and design of
such signs are compatible with their surroundings.
      (2)   Authorized exceptions. Signs requiring special exception shall be
limited to the following signs:
         (a)   Projecting signs, when such signs do not project over a public
right-of-way, other than a pedestrian alley, are pedestrian-oriented, and are
of a carved or hand painted artistic nature. The mounting brackets of such
signs shall be an integral part of the sign and complementary to the design of
the sign.
         (b)   Wooden wall- mounted signs either carved or hand painted;
         (c)   Low profile planter- type signs other than ground base or
monument signs as herein defined which contain no copy other than the business
name or logo type;
         (d)   Kiosks or similar structures when such structures are located
within primarily pedestrian-oriented circulation areas. Such structures shall
be permitted only in shopping centers and shall be subject to the approval of
such other Commissions as may be deemed advisable by the Zoning Administrator;
         (e)   Banners of a community-oriented nature, when such banners are
hung in pedestrian-oriented commercial districts;
         (f)   Signs pertinent to various religious institutions and units of
local government including Illinois school districts and the Village in the
community, when such signs may or may not be located on the premises of the
uses being named and may or may not contain illumination.
      (3)   Standards. It shall be the responsibility of the Zoning
Administrator to see to it that any proposed sign and/or sign structure for
which a special exception is sought shall meet each and every one of the
following requirements:
         (a)   The proposed sign shall not be contrary to the intent of this
chapter;
         (b)   The proposed sign shall be in accordance with the intent of this
section;
         (c)   The proposed sign shall comply with all applicable provisions of
this chapter, unless any such provisions are expressly permitted to be varied
by the special exceptions procedure;
         (d)   The proposed sign is reasonably necessary, and the degree of the
exception is the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose of the sign
itself; and
         (e)   The sign will not result in adverse effects upon the neighboring
properties, or the health, safety, and general welfare of the public.
      (C)   Application.
         (1)   The petitioner shall file an application for a variation or
special exception on forms provided by the Zoning Administrator, who shall
forward a copy, without delay, to the Village Clerk for processing and notice.
         (2)   The application for a variance or special exception shall
contain the following informa-tion as well as such additional information as
may be prescribed by rule of the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission:
            (a)   The particular requirements of this chapter which prevent the
proposed use or construction of such sign;
            (b)   The characteristics of the subject property which prevent
compliance with the said requirements of this chapter;
            (c)   The minimum requirements which would be necessary to permit
the proposed use or construction of such sign;
            (d)   In the case of variations, the practical difficulty or
particular hardship which would result if the aforesaid particular requirements
of this chapter were applied to the subject property and/or the proposed sign
thereon;
            (e)   A legal description of the subject property;
            (f)   The commonly known location (address) of the subject
property;
            (g)   The present zoning classification of the subject property.
         (3)   At the time of filing, the application for a variation or
special exception shall be accompanied by:
            (a)   Proof of ownership, proof of authority on behalf of the
owner, or current contract to purchase or lease the subject property;
            (b)   Payment of public hearing fee of $300; and
            (c)   Such additional charges as may be necessary to cover the cost
of court reporter fees.
   (D)   Processing variance applications.
      (1)   Application filed. Upon receipt by the Village Clerk of a copy of
the application for variation that has been duly filed with the Zoning
Administrator, the Village Clerk shall assign the case and/or docket number to
the petition and shall main-tain a file for such petition, which file shall be
open to the public for inspection during regular business hours. All documents
pertinent to the case (applica-tion, legal notice, evidence, exhibits, report
of proceedings, and the like) shall be placed in said file by the Village
Clerk.
      (2)   Not more than 30 days nor less than 15 days before the hearing on
which the application for variation is to be considered, the Village Clerk
shall cause notice thereof to be published in one or more newspapers published
in the Village or, if no news-paper is published within the Village, then in
one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the Village. The
notice herein required shall contain:
         (a)   The legal description of the subject property for which the
variation is requested;
         (b)   The address of the subject property for which the variation is
requested;
         (c)   A brief statement of the nature of the requested sign variation;
         (d)   The name(s) and address(es) of the legal and/or beneficial owner
(s) of the property for which the variation is requested;
         (e)   The name(s) and address(es) of the petitioner(s);
         (f)   The name of the legal representative of the petitioner, if any;
and
         (g)   A statement of the date, time, and place of the hearing for
which the notice is being given.
      (3)   Hearing. Any party in interest may appear and be heard at the
hearing held pursuant to any such application for a sign variation, and such
appearance may be made in person, by agent (if a corporation), or by attorney.
   (E)   Variance standards.
      (1)   The Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission shall not vary the
regulations of this chapter unless it shall make findings of fact based upon
evidence presented at the hearing in any given case that:
         (a)   The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if a
sign may be permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located;
         (b)   The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances, and the
proposed sign varia-tions will not merely serve as a convenience to the
petitioner but will alleviate some demonstrable and unusual hardship which will
result if the strict letter of the regulations of this chapter were carried out
and which particular hardship or practical difficulty is not generally
applicable to other property within the same zoning district;
         (c)   The alleged hardship has not been abated by any person presently
having a proprietary interest in the subject property;
         (d)   The proposed variation will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood;
         (e)   The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood; and
         (f)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the spirit and intent
of this chapter.
      (2)   The Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission shall not grant a
special exception from the regulations of this chapter unless the special
exception is authorized by this section and meets the standards set forth in
division (B)(3) of this section.
   (F)   Variance conditions and restrictions. The Zoning, Planning, and
Appeals Commission may recommend and the President and Board of Trustees may
impose such conditions and restrictions upon the subject property, the
location, the construction, design and use of the sign proposed under such
variation request as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the
foregoing standards and to protect adjacent property and property values.
   (G)   Action on variation requests.
      (1)   The Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission shall, within 15 days
after the close of the hearing, recommend the granting or denial of a request
for variance, unless, within such period of time, the Zoning, Planning, and
Appeals Commission shall make request to and receive permission from the
President and Board of Trustees for an additional 15 days within which to
decide or recommend. If, at the expiration of such 15 days, the Zoning,
Planning, and Appeals Commission does not make its recommen-dation or decision
(as the case may be), it shall be concluded that the Zoning, Planning, and
Appeals Commission recommended against granting the requested variance.
      (2)   Whenever a variation is to be made, it shall be made (if at all) by
ordinance duly adopted by the President and Board of Trustees following receipt
of the report and recommendation of the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals

GENERAL
§ 155.101 TITLE.
   This Chapter shall be known, cited and referred to as the Schiller Park
Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.102 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES.
   This Zoning Ordinance is adopted for the purpose of improving and protecting
the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare of the
property. The fulfillment of this purpose is to be accomplished by seeking the
following objectives:
   (A)   To zone all properties with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the
Village.
   (B)   To protect residential, business, commercial and industrial areas
alike from harmful encroachment by incompatible uses and to ensure that land
which is allocated to a class of uses shall not be usurped by other
inappropriate uses.
   (C)   To avoid the inappropriate development of lands and provide for
adequate drainage, curbing of erosion and reduction of flood damage.
   (D)   To fix standards to which buildings and structures shall conform.
   (E)   To prevent such additions to, and alterations or remodeling of,
existing buildings or structures as would not comply with the restrictions and
limitations imposed herein.
   (F)   To foster a more rational pattern of relationship between residential,
commercial and manufacturing uses for the mutual benefit of all.
   (G)   To lessen congestion on the public streets.
   (H)   To control concentration of populations, thereby ensuring proper
living and working conditions and preventing the development of blight and
slums.
   (I)   To establish adequate standards for the provision of light, air and
open spaces.
   (J)   To provide for adequate transportation facilities and for other public
requirements and services such as water, sewerage, schools and parks.
   (K)   To isolate or control the location or unavoidable nuisance-producing
uses.
   (L)   To define the powers and duties of the administrative and enforcement
officers and bodies.
   (M)   To prescribe penalties for any violation of the provisions of this
Chapter, or of any amendment thereto.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.103 INTENT.
   The standards and requirements contained in this Chapter, and the district
mapping reflected on the Village of Schiller Park Zoning District Map are
intended to implement the objectives of the comprehensive plan for the Village.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.104 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   All buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or buildings established
hereafter, and all structural alterations or relocations of existing buildings
occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of this Chapter which
are applicable to the zoning districts in which such buildings, uses or land
shall be located; however, where a building permit for a building or structure
has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of this
Chapter and provided that construction is begun within six months of such
effective date and diligently prosecuted to completion (completion to be
accomplished within 18 months of the adoption of this Chapter), said building
or structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the
basis of which the building permit has been issued, and, further, may upon
completion be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use for which
originally designated, subject thereafter to the provisions of
Article V, Nonconforming Buildings, Structures and Uses.
   Where the Zoning Administrator has issued a permissive use, permit, a
conditional use permit, or a permit for a variance pursuant to the provisions
of this Chapter, such permit shall become null and void unless work thereon is
substantially underway within six months of the date of the issuance of such
permit by the Zoning Administrator, and completed within 18 months of the
issuance of such permit.
   A conditional use permit shall be deemed to authorize only one particular
conditional use and shall expire if the conditional use shall cease for more
than six months for any reason.
   Where a lot is to be occupied for a permitted use without buildings, the
side yards and front yard required for such lot shall be provided and
maintained unless otherwise stipulated in this Chapter, except that side yards
shall not be required on lots used for garden purposes without buildings or
structures and no side or front yard shall be required on lots used for public
recreation areas.
   No land which is located in a residence district shall be used for driveway,
walkway or access purposes to any land which is located in a commercial or
industrial district, or used for any purpose not permitted in a residence
district.

to an alley, fences shall be placed either at least three (3) feet back from
the rear lot line, or at or behind the garage or parking pad, whichever is
lesser from the rear lot line. However, if the fence does not exceed four (4)
feet and remains open, the fence may be set at the rear lot line.

§ 155.110 REGULATIONS FOR LICENSED RADIO AND/OR TELEVISION TOWERS AND/OR OTHER
TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING PERSONAL WIRELESS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (A)   Purpose and Interpretation; Procedure.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to provide specific regulations for
the placement, construction and modification of radio and/or television towers
and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment, including personal wireless
telecommunications facilities. The provisions of this section are not intended
and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the
provision of personal wireless services, nor shall the provisions of this
section be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between
providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services. To the extent
that any provision or provisions of this section are inconsistent or in
conflict with any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to control.
      (2)   In the course of reviewing any request for any approval required
under this chapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service or
to install radio and/or television towers and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment, including personal wireless telecommunications facilities,
the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission shall act within a reasonable
period of time after the request is duly filed with the Village Clerk, taking
into account the nature and scope of the request. A recommendation to deny such
a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained
in a written record.
      (3)   Should the application of this section have the effect of
prohibiting a person or entity from providing personal wireless service or
other telecommunications service to all or a portion of the Village, such
provider may petition the Village for an amendment to this section, in the
manner provided in Article VIII of this chapter for amendments. Upon receipt of
the recommendation of the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission regarding
such petition, the President and Board of Trustees shall promptly undertake
review of the petition and shall make a determination on the petition within a
reasonable period of time, taking into account the nature and scope of the
petition. A decision to deny such a petition shall be in writing and supported
by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
   (B)   Radio and/or Television Towers and/or Other Transmitting and Receiving
Equipment, Including Personal Wireless Telecommunications Facilities as
Allowable Uses.
      (1)   A radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment or a personal wireless telecommunication facility shall be
considered an accessory use to an existing permitted use within the zoning
district wherein such radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting
and receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility is
located whenever the radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting
and receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility
otherwise conforms to all minimum setback and yard requirements of such zoning
district contained in this chapter and also conforms to all applicable federal
laws and regulations concerning its use and operation; and shall not require a
height variation whenever:
         (a)   The radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility is located
in a wooded area and is camouflaged to appear to be a tree similar to and not
more than ten feet above the average height of other trees in such wooded area;
or
         (b)   The radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility is directly
affixed to an existing building and the height of the radio and/or television
tower and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless
telecommunication facility does not exceed ten feet above the roof of an
existing building whether or not the personal wireless telecommunications
facility uses a roof-mounted antenna; or
         (c)   The radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility is located
within the I-1 Industrial District or the I-2 General Industrial District and
mounted on a free-standing antenna tower and the antenna height above grade
does not exceed 100 feet.
      (2)   All other radio and/or television towers and/or other transmitting
and receiving equipment, including personal wireless telecommunication
facilities, shall be considered a conditional use, and shall require a height
variation for that portion of the height of the radio and/or television tower
and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless
telecommunication facility in excess of the maximum height requirements set
forth in this Chapter for the zoning district wherein the radio and/or
television towers and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment, including
personal wireless telecommunications facility is sought to be erected.
   (C)   Action by the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission and the
President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   In considering a request for approval of a special use permit or
variations to permit the installation of radio and/or television tower and/or
other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless
telecommunication facilities as described in this Section, the Zoning,
Planning, and Appeals Commission and the President and Board of Trustees shall
apply the criteria and other standards set forth in this Section as well as the
general standards for conditional uses set forth elsewhere in this Chapter, and
also shall give due consideration and weight to whether:
         (a)   The plans submitted will provide for co-location of other radio
and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment or
personal wireless telecommunication equipment on the same antenna support
structure, so as to minimize the proliferation of antenna support structures;
and
         (b)   The applicant has sought and been denied the opportunity to co-
locate its radio and/or television and/or other transmitting and receiving
equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facilities on an existing
antenna support structure; and
         (c)   The applicant has made adequate efforts but is unable to obtain
a site for its facilities within the I-1 Industrial District or the I-2 General
Industrial District.
      (2)   In considering a request for approval of a special use permit or
variations to permit the installation of radio and/or television towers and/or
other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless
telecommunication facilities as described in this Section, by express condition
the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission may recommend, and the President
and Board of Trustees may require, that the applicant shall allow, on a
commercially reasonable basis, other providers of telecommunications services
to co-locate additional personal wireless service facilities on a free-standing
pole which is part of the applicant's proposed radio and/or television tower
and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless
telecommunication facility, where such co-location is technologically feasible.
   (D)   Criteria for Cell Sites and the Placement of Radio and/or Television
Towers and/or Other Transmitting and Receiving Equipment, Including Personal
Wireless Telecommunications Facilities. Wherever located within the corporate
limits of the Village, all radio and/or television towers and/or other
transmitting and receiving equipment, including personal wireless
telecommunications facilities shall be located in conformity with the following
criteria:
      (1)   Antenna height. The applicant for such special use permit or
variation, as the case may be, shall demonstrate that antenna height is the
minimum required to provide satisfactory operation of the radio and/or
television and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment or personal
wireless telecommunication facilities. No antenna height that is higher than
such minimum shall be approved.
      (2)   Color. Antenna support structures and antennas shall have a finish
color of non-contrasting black, blue, gray, or other color which minimizes the
visibility of the antenna support structure, provided such color does not
violate applicable regulations of the FAA.
      (3)   Compatibility. Radio and/or television towers and/or other
transmitting and receiving equipment, including personal wireless
telecommunication facilities shall be compatible architecturally with adjacent
buildings and land uses or otherwise integrated, through location and design,
to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
Site location and erection of a radio and/or television tower and/or other
transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication
facility shall preserve the pre- existing character of the site as much as
possible. Existing vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance
of the existing topography of the site shall be minimized, unless such
disturbance will result in less visual impact of the site upon the areas
adjacent thereto.
      (4)   Design. Antenna towers shall be constructed in conformance with the
then current standards of the Electronic Industries Association, the FAA, and
the FCC.
      (5)   Equipment structures. All ground level equipment structures shall
comply with the requirements of the Village of Schiller Park Building Code,
shall not have a floor area exceeding 300 square feet nor a height exceeding 12
feet, and shall be screened by non-deciduous plantings from the view of persons
of at least six feet in height who stand 100 feet from all adjacent lot lines.
      (6)   Fencing. In order to thwart unauthorized access thereto and
minimize any danger to persons, all antenna support structures and ground level
equipment structures shall be fenced from adjacent areas by an eight foot high
fence otherwise meeting the requirements of the Municipal Code of the Village
of Schiller Park.
      (7)   Lights and signage. Unless required by the FCC, all lights,
signals, and/or signs of any kind are prohibited on any radio and/or television
tower and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment and/or structure,
including a personal wireless telecommunication facility.
      (8)   Off-street parking. Paved off-street parking adequate to provide
parking for at least two trucks shall be required to be installed upon the lot
whereon any such special use permit is issued.
      (9)   Setback. In the industrial and commercial zoning districts of the
Village, the radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication facility, shall be
setback from adjacent lot lines a distance equal to the requirements for front,
rear, and side yards for the zoning district upon which the antenna site is
located. However, in the event the antenna is sited upon a lot adjacent to a
residential zoning district, the setback from such district shall be at least
equal to the antenna height or zoning district yard requirements, whichever is
greater, from such residential district. Required fencing shall be located in
accord with existing fence regulations therefor.
   (E)   Prohibited Placement and/or Maintenance of Radio and/or Television
Towers and/or Other Transmitting and Receiving Equipment, Including Personal
Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
      (1)   No variation or special use permit shall be granted to permit any
radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and receiving equipment
or personal wireless telecommunication facility upon any lot in a residential
or commercial zoning district which is improved with a structure designed for
or containing a permitted use.
      (2)   No radio and/or television tower and/or other transmitting and
receiving equipment, including personal wireless telecommunications facility
shall be permitted in any zoning district in the Village unless such service
use complies with all applicable federal laws and regulations, including but
not limited to those concerned with use and operation. Such equipment shall be
removed within six months of its becoming technologically obsolete.
   (F)   Nonconformities. All radio and/or television towers and/or other
transmitting and receiving equipment or personal wireless telecommunication
facilities installed and operating prior to the enactment of this Section which
would be prohibited hereunder shall be considered legal nonconforming uses and/
or legal nonconforming structures, as the case may be, and shall be subject to
the rules for nonconforming buildings and uses set forth in this Chapter.

ARTICLE III.
ADMINISTRATION  AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 155.301 OFFICE OF THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator of the Village and such deputies or
assistants that have been, or shall be, duly appointed by the Village President
shall administer and enforce this chapter and in addition thereto, and in
furtherance of such authority, shall:
      (1)   Issue all zoning certificates and make and maintain records
thereof;
      (2)   Issue all certificates of occupancy, and make and maintain records
thereof;
      (3)   Conduct inspections of buildings, structures and uses of land to
determine compliance with the terms of this chapter;
      (4)   Maintain permanent and current records of this chapter, including,
but not limited to, all maps, amendments, conditional uses, variances, appeals
and applications therefor;
      (5)   Provide and maintain a public information service relative to all
matters arising out of this chapter;
      (6)   Forward to the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission all
applications filed with the office of the Zoning Administrator; and
      (7)   Initiate, from time to time, a study of the provisions of this
chapter, and to make reports of his recommendations to the Zoning, Planning and
Appeals Commission and the Village Manager not less frequently than once a
year.
   (B)   In addition, it shall be the duty of all members of the police
department to assist the Zoning Administrator by reporting to him upon new
construction, reconstruction, new land uses, or possible violations.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.302 INTERPRETATION.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare.
   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter, upon the use
of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings, are either more restrictive
or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision
of this chapter or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation
of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher
standards or requirements shall govern. Accordingly, while this chapter is not
intended to abrogate any easement or covenant or any other private agreement,
whenever the regulations of this chapter are most restrictive or impose higher
standards or requirements than such easements or covenants or other private
agreements, the requirements of this chapter shall govern.
   Although the district requirements are couched in very specific terms in
most instances, reasonable flexibility is offered through such devises as
conditional uses, planned unit developments, floor area ratio and variations.
   No building, structure or use which was not lawfully existing at the time of
the adoption of this chapter shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of
the adoption o this chapter; and to the extent that, and in any manner that,
said unlawful building, structure or use is in conflict with the requirements
of this chapter, said building, structure or use remains unlawful hereunder.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.303 INTERPRETATION OF USE LISTS.
   (A)   Permitted Uses. Permitted uses of land or buildings, as hereinafter
listed, shall be permitted in the districts indicated under the conditions
specified. Unless otherwise specifically set forth, wherever a permitted use is
named as a major category in this Article, it shall be deemed to include all
and only those itemized uses under the said major category.
      (1)   No building or tract of land shall be devoted to any use other than
a use permitted hereinafter in the zoning district in which such building or
tract of land shall be located, with the exception of the following:
         (a)   Uses lawfully established on the effective date of this chapter;
         (b)   Conditional uses, allowed in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (B) below.
      (2)   Uses established on the effective date of this chapter and rendered
nonconforming by the provisions thereof shall be subject to the regulations of
Article IV, regulating nonconforming buildings, structures and uses.
   (B)   Conditional Uses. Conditional uses, as hereinafter listed, may be
allowed in the zoning districts indicated, subject to the issuance of
conditional use permits. Unless otherwise specifically set forth, wherever a
conditional use is named as a major category in this Article, it shall be
deemed to include all and only those itemized uses listed under the said
category.
   (C)   Prohibited Uses. Generally, if a proposed use is not listed as a
permitted or conditional use in any given district, such proposed use is
prohibited in that district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Zoning
Administrator may allow land uses (permitted or conditional) which, though not
contained by name in a zoning district list of permitted or conditional uses,
are deemed to be similar in nature and clearly compatible with the listed uses;
however, such non-listed uses shall not be approved by the Zoning Administrator
until the application for such use has been reviewed by the Zoning, Planning,
and Appeals Commission and approved by the Village Board. In residential
districts it is prohibited to raise animals, poultry or livestock except cats,
dogs or birds as household pets; or conduct general farming practices, except
for gardening.
   (D)   Yard Requirements.
      (1)   Yard requirements shall be as set forth under each zoning district.
Front, side and rear yards shall be provided in accordance with the regulations
hereinafter indicated and shall be unobstructed from the ground level to the
sky.
      (2)   All accessory buildings which are attached to principal buildings
(e.g., attached garages) shall comply with the yard requirements of the
principal building.
   (E)    All non listed uses which are tentatively approved by the Village
Board shall be added to the appropriate use list by ordinance at the time of
periodic updating and revision.
   (F)   There shall be only one principal use allowed per zoning lot.
   (G)   Except as expressly allowed as a principal permitted or conditional
use, all indoor and outdoor storage, including off-street parking, must be
accessory to a zoning lot’s principal use.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 08- 2691, passed 9-23-08; Ord. 18-
4089, passed 9-6-18; Am. Ord. 19-4167, passed 8-1-19)
§ 155.304 ZONING CERTIFICATES.
   Except as hereinafter provided, no permit pertaining to the use of land or
buildings shall be issued by any officer, department or employee of the Village
unless the application for such permit has been examined by the Zoning
Administrator, and has affixed to it his certificate, indicating that the
proposed building or structure complies with all the provisions of this
Chapter. Any permit or certificate of occupancy, issued in conflict with the
provisions of this chapter, shall be null and void. Every application for a
building permit shall be deemed to be an application for a zoning certificate.

§ 155.305 REGULATION; HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   (A)   Standards for Home Occupations. Home occupations as defined in §
155.202 shall comply with the following standards:

dwelling unit in which they are registered and only by the residents whom
occupy said dwelling unit in which the home occupation is conducted;
      (2)   There shall be no separate exterior entrance to the building for
the specific use of conducting business for the Home Occupation. The entrance
to any space devoted to a home occupation shall be from within the dwelling,
not from the outside of the property;
      (3)   There shall be no exterior display, no exterior signs, no exterior
storage of materials, and no other exterior indication of the home occupation
or variation from the residential character of the principal building;
      (4)   The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be
clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its
occupants and not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the floor area of the
dwelling unit, not to exceed four hundred (400) square feet in area, shall be
used in the conduct of the home occupation;
      (5)   No person may regularly assist or be employed on the site in
connection with the home occupation that is not an actual resident of the
dwelling unit. The purpose of this standard is to ensure that no nonresident
comes to a dwelling for employment purposes, and to minimize the traffic
generated by the home occupation in Village residential areas;
      (6)   No mechanical or electrical equipment other than the type normally
found in a residential single-dwelling unit shall be utilized on the premises;
and
      (7)   The home occupation shall not involve the sale of commodities upon
the premises.
   (B)   Violations.
      (1)   Any violation of this section shall result in the imposition of a
fine, not less than $750.00; each subsequent day the violation continues to
exist shall elicit an additional fine of $750.00, until such time as the
violation no longer exists.
      (2)   There shall be a presumption of a continuing violation until
adjudicated or until the Community Development Director, or designee,
determines that the violation has been abated, corrected or no longer exists.
      (3)   The imposition of the accruing fine, or any part thereof shall be
at the discretion of the Administrative Hearing Officer or Judge (if this
matter ends up in a county courthouse).
   (C)   Notice. Upon service of a notice of violation of this section and a
citation, it shall be sufficient to provide notice of continuing daily fines,
if no compliance has been achieved, by mail - as necessary - to the last known
address of the respondent cited or with service of the citation.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 15- 3007, passed 6-4-15)
§ 155.306 FEES.
   Any person, firm, corporation or agent, who shall file an application for
amendment or application for an appeal, variance or conditional use, or for any
other certificate or license required under the terms of this Chapter, shall be
charged a fee in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the
President and Board of Trustees of the Village.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 15- 3007, passed 6-4-15)
§ 155.307 PENALTIES.
   (A)   Any person, firm, corporation, or agent, or any employee or contractor
of same, who violates, destroys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with, or
who resists enforcement of any provision of this Chapter for which a specific
fine has not already been allocated, shall be subject to a fine of not more
than $500, plus costs for each offense. A subsequent offense is deemed to be
committed each day during, or on which a violation is permitted to occur.
   (B)   There shall be a presumption of a continuing violation until
adjudicated or until the Community Development Director, or designee,
determines that the violation has been abated, corrected or no longer exists.
   (C)   The imposition of the accruing fine, or any part thereof, shall be at
the discretion of the Administrative Hearing Officer or Judge (if this matter
ends up in a county courthouse).

ARTICLE IV.
NONCONFORMING  BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES
§ 155.401 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   This Chapter establishes separate districts, each of which is an appropriate
area for the location of the uses which are permitted in that district. It is
necessary and consistent with the establishment of those districts that those
nonconforming buildings, structures and uses which substantially and adversely
affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in the
district not be permitted to continue without restriction. The purpose of this
Article IV is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings,
structures and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under
which those nonconforming buildings, structures and uses shall be permitted to
continue.

time of the adoption of this Chapter and which remains nonconforming, and any
such building, structure or use which shall become nonconforming upon the
adoption of this Chapter, or of any subsequent amendment thereto, may be
continued subject to the regulations which follow. None of the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance as amended pertaining to adult uses shall be construed to
permit any use or activities that presently are or in the future may be
prohibited by law. [Ord. 94-1867]

regulations of the district in which said building or structure is located.
   (C)   Additions and Enlargements. A nonconforming building or structure
which is nonconforming as to bulk, and is designed or intended for permitted
use, shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless such additions or
enlargements thereto are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which it is located, and unless such nonconforming building or
structure, including all additions or enlargements thereto, shall conform to
the following:

it is to be located.
   (E)   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure Designed or Intended for
a Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming building or structure which is destroyed
or damaged by fire or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost
of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence shall
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the restoration of the entire
building new, shall not be restored unless said building or structure, and the
use thereof, shall conform to all of the regulations of the district in which
it is located.
      (1)   In the event such damage or destruction is less than fifty percent
(50%) of the cost of restoration of the entire building new, no repair or
reconstruction shall be made unless such restoration is started within one year
from the date of partial destruction and is completed within one year
thereafter.
      (2)   If the restoration is not started within one year of said calamity
and diligently prosecuted to completion, the building or structure shall be

building, structure or premises is discontinued for a continuous period of 12
months, it shall not be renewed, and any subsequent use of the building,
structure or premises shall conform to the use regulations of the district in
which such building, structure or premises is located.

the district in which the building or structure is located.
      (2)   The nonconforming use of part of a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a
use permitted in the district in which it is located, shall not be expanded or
extended into any other portion of such building or structure, nor changed to
any other nonconforming use.

structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is
incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be expanded
or extended beyond the area it occupies.
   (H)   Change of Nonconforming Use.
      (1)   The nonconforming use of a pre-ordinance building or structure, all
or substantially all of which is designed or intended to accommodate a use not
currently allowed in the district in which it is located, may be changed to a
use allowed in the most restrictive district in which the nonconforming use
which presently occupies the building or structure is a permitted or
conditional use, or to a use permitted in a more restrictive district. For the
purposes of this subsection, the R-1 District shall be considered the most
restrictive and the I-2 General Industrial District the least restrictive.

when such nonconforming use is located in a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which building or structure is designed or intended for a
permitted use.

structure, or in connection with which any building or structure thereon is
incidental or accessory to the principal use of the land, shall not be changed

intent of such building or structure.
   (A)   In all residence districts any use of a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use permitted only in

the nonconformity.
   (D)   In all districts any use of a building or structure, all or
substantially all of which existed lawfully at the time of these amendments

such use.
         (b)   When the only buildings or structures or other physical
improvements are accessory or incidental to such use.
      (3)   A nonconforming use of land which is accessory to the nonconforming
use of building or structure shall be discontinued on the same date the
nonconforming use of the building or structure is discontinued.
      (4)   Improvements located underground, or substantially at ground level,
which comprise all or substantially all of the improvements employed in a
nonconforming use of land, and which have an assessed valuation in excess of

VARIATIONS
§ 155.701 PURPOSE.
   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission, after a public hearing, may
make recommendations to the Village Board to vary the regulations of this
Chapter in harmony with their general purpose and intent, only in the specific
instances hereinafter set forth, where such Board makes findings of fact in

§ 155.703 STANDARDS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall not make a
recommendation to the Village Board to vary the regulations of this Chapter, as
authorized in this Article, unless it shall make findings of facts based upon
the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
      (1)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a practical
difficulty or particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished
from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be
carried out;
      (2)   The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based
are unique to the property for which the variance is sought, and are not
applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification;
      (3)   The purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire
to increase financial gain;
      (4)   The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any
person presently having a proprietary interest in the property;
      (5)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in
which the property is located;
      (6)   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light
and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the
public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety,
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
and
      (7)   The proposed variation is in harmony with the general purpose and
intent of this Chapter.
   (B)   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission may recommend such
conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variance as may
be necessary to comply with the standards established in this Section and the
objectives of this Chapter.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.704 AUTHORIZED VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances from the regulations of this Chapter shall be recommended by
the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission only in accordance with the
standards established in §
155.703, "Standards for Variances," above, and may be recommended only in the
following instances and in no others:
      (1)   To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including ceiling level
height, maximum height, maximum lot coverage, and minimum yard requirements;
      (2)   To vary the applicable lot area, lot width and lot depth
requirements of this Chapter, but in no event shall the respective area and
width of the lot or lots be less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the
required area and width;
      (3)   To permit the same off-street parking facility to qualify as
required facilities to two or more uses, provided that substantial use of such
facility by each user does not take place at approximately the same hours of
the same days of the week;
      (4)   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities
required by not more than one parking space or loading space, or twenty-five
percent (25%) of the required facilities, whichever number is greater;
      (5)   To increase by not more than twenty-five percent (25%) the maximum
distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the use
served;
      (6)   To permit the extension of a district zone to include less
intensively zoned land where the boundary lines of such district divides a lot
or tract held in single ownership at the time of the passage of this Chapter;
provided, however, that the less intensively zoned tract of land contained less
than 4,000 square feet in area;
      (7)   To permit the reconstruction of a building which is nonconforming
solely as to bulk and which building has been damaged or destroyed by fire,
explosion, act or God, or public enemy, to the extent [of] more than seventy-
five percent (75%) of the cost of the restoration of the entire building new,
where the Board finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use
is not to continue a monopoly.
      (8)   To permit the validity for a period longer than one year of any
order of the Zoning Board of Appeals or ordinance granting a variation pursuant
to the other requirements of this Chapter. However, the validity of any order
of the Zoning Board of Appeals or ordinance granting any zoning relief under
this Chapter may be extended beyond one year by the Village Board of Trustees
upon good cause shown as determined by the Board of Trustees, without
additional hearings before the Zoning Planning and Appeals Commission.
   (B)   No ordinance of the Village granting a variance shall be valid for a
period longer than one year from the date of such ordinance unless the building
permit is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a
building is started or the use is commenced within such period; however,
extensions of not more than two 6-month periods may be granted by written order
of the Director of Community Development, if he or she determines that the
owner or developer has diligently pursued commencement of construction.

§ 155.806 FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATION.
   (A)   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall make written
findings of fact and shall submit same together with its recommendations to the
Board of Trustees. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is to
change the zoning classification of particular property, the Board shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with
respect to the following matters:
      (1)   Existing use of property within the general area of the property in
question;
      (2)   The extent to which property values are diminished by the existing
zoning classification;
      (3)   The extent to which the existing zoning classification and/or
proposed zoning promotes the general health, safety, and welfare of the
citizenry of the Village;
      (4)   The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed
upon the applicant;
      (5)   The suitability of the particular property for the purposes for
which it is presently zoned;
      (6)   The length of time that the property has been vacant, as presently
zoned, considered in the context of the land development in the area in which
the property is located; and
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed zoning with the comprehensive
plan of the Village.
   (B)   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall not recommend the
adoption of a proposed amendment unless it finds that the adoption of such
amendment is in the public interest and is not solely for the interest of the
applicant; and that either the proposed amendment will correct an existing

Planning and Appeals Commission may recommend the adoption of an amendment
changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any higher
classification than that requested by the applicant. For the purpose of this

ARTICLE IX.
CONDITIONAL USES
§ 155.901 PURPOSE.
   The development and execution of this Chapter is based upon the division of
the community into districts, within which districts the use of land and
buildings, and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to
the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts, without consideration, in
each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use in the particular location. Such conditional uses
fall into two categories:
   (A)   Uses publicly operated or traditionally effected with a public
interest; and
   (B)   Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property or public facilities.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.902 INITIATION OF REQUEST FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   Conditional uses may be proposed by the Village Board or by the Village
Manager/Comptroller or by the owner of the property in question or by the
contract purchaser of the property in question, provided the owner of the
property consents to such initiation.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.903 APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   An application for a conditional use shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator at least 45 days before a regularly scheduled meeting of the
Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission on a form prescribed by the Zoning
Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by such plans and/or data
prescribed by the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission, and shall include a
statement in writing by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the
proposed conditional use will conform to the standards set forth in this
Article. Such application shall be forwarded from the Zoning Administrator to
the members of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission with a request to
review said application and accompanying data, conduct a public hearing
thereon, and submit written findings of facts and recommendations thereon to
the Village Board.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.904 HEARING ON APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE; NOTICE.
   Following receipt by the Zoning Administrator of any application for a
conditional use, the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall hold a
public hearing on the application at such time and place as shall be
established by the chairman and set forth in the published notice of hearing.
The notice requirement for a conditional use hearing shall be the same as those
prescribed for amendments. Records shall be preserved in such manner as the
Board shall, by rule, prescribe from time to time.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.905 FINDINGS OF FACTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall make written findings of
facts and shall submit same together with its recommendations to the Village
Board for final action. The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall not
recommend a conditional use for approval, unless such Board shall find:
      (1)   That the establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare;
      (2)   That the conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood;
      (3)   That the establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding property for
uses permitted in the district;
      (4)   That the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of any
proposed structure will not be so at variance with either the exterior
architectural appeal and functional plan of the structures already constructed
or in the course of construction in the immediate neighborhood or character of
the applicable district, as to cause a substantial depreciation in the property
values within the neighborhood;
      (5)   That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary
facilities have been or are being provided;
      (6)   That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide
ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public
streets; and
      (7)   That the conditional use shall, in all other respects, conform to
the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as
such regulations may, in each instance, be modified by the Village Board of
Trustees pursuant to the recommendations of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals
Commission.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.906 CONDITIONS AND GUARANTEES.
   Prior to the granting of any conditional use, the Zoning, Planning and
Appeals Commission in a conclusion paragraph, separate from the findings of
facts, may stipulate such conditions and restrictions, upon the establishment,
location, construction, maintenance and operation of the conditional use as is
deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the standards and requirements specified in this Article. In
all cases in which conditional uses are recommended for approval, the President
and Board of Trustees may require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem
necessary as proof that there is and will be compliance with the conditions
stipulated in connection therewith.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.907 ACTION BY THE VILLAGE BOARD.
   The Village Board may grant by ordinance or deny by motion, any application
for conditional use, and may establish such conditions and restrictions upon
the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the
conditional use, as is deemed necessary for the protection of the public
interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified
in this Section.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.908 EFFECT OF DENIAL OF A CONDITIONAL USE.
   No application for a conditional use, which has been denied wholly or in
part by the Village Board, shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from
the date of said order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or
proof of change of conditions founds to be valid by the Zoning, Planning, and
Appeals Commission.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.909 REVOCATION.
   In any case, where a conditional use has not been established (substantially
underway) within one year from the date of granting thereof, then without
further action by the Zoning, Planning, and Appeals Commission or the Village
Board the authorization for the conditional use shall be null and void.

ARTICLE XX.
I-2 GENERAL INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
§ 155.2001 PURPOSE.
   In the development and execution of the entire Zoning Ordinance of the
Village, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very
nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under
certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent
areas, particularly adjacent and nearby residential and commercial areas where
nurseries, schools, nursing homes, churches, and similar uses are located.
Proper and realistic zoning and special regulations of these uses are necessary
to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting,
down-grading of the surrounding neighborhood, or discouraging normal
development of undeveloped areas. These special regulations are itemized in
this section. A primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing
a concentration of these uses in any one area.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2002 CONDITIONS.
   Uses allowed in the I-2 General Industrial District are subject to the
following conditions:
   (A)   All business, servicing or processing, except for off-street parking
and off-street loading, shall be conducted within completely enclosed
buildings, unless otherwise indicated in this section.
   (B)   All storage, including but not limited to motor vehicles and junk
vehicles in operable condition, shall be within completely enclosed buildings
or completely concealed by a solid wall or solid fence (including solid
entrance and exit gates) not less than six feet nor more than eight feet in
height. Chain link fencing is prohibited.
   (C)   All adult uses shall be subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   No adult use shall be allowed within 500 feet of another existing
adult use.
      (2)   No adult use shall be located within 1,000 feet of any zoning
district which is zoned for a residential use.
      (3)   No adult use shall be located within 1,000 feet of a preexisting
school or place of worship.
      (4)   No adult use shall be conducted in any manner that permits the
observation of any material depicting, describing or relating to "specified
anatomical areas" or "specified sexual activities", from any public way. This
shall apply to any display, decoration, sign, show window or other opening.
   (D)   Screening of objectionable views. 
      (1)   Reasonable visual privacy shall be provided for exposed storage
areas, machinery installations, and trash or garbage containers as to prevent
their being incongruous with the existing environment and neighboring public or
private property. Complete concealment using methods including but not limited
to, fencing, barriers and/or landscaping installed in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter will be required for the protection and the privacy
of the enclosure's contents as well as the aesthetic enhancement of property.
      (2)   Lighting installed upon a building, structure, sign, or within any
other fixture shall be shielded so as to prohibit light trespass upon a
neighboring property or the public thoroughfare. It shall be unlawful to
maintain light levels greater than one foot-candle at any time of day as
measured at the curb line.

ARTICLE XXI.
CONDITIONAL USES IN THE NATURE OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 155.2101 PURPOSE.
   In an effort to promote ingenuity, imagination, and design efforts on the
part of owners, builders, architects, and developers and to produce
developments which are in keeping with overall land use intensity and open
space objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, this Article makes available a
conditional use procedure departing from the strict application of the specific
zoning requirements of the district where the development is located. The
intent of this Article is to permit such flexibility and provide performance
criteria for planned unit development permits which: Allow a creative approach
to the development of land; accomplish a more desirable environment than would
be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of zoning
and subdivision ordinances; provide for an efficient use of land, facilitating
a more economic arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land use and
utilities; enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of
natural features, the provision of underground utilities, and the provision of
recreation and open space; and provide an environment of stable character
compatible with surrounding areas.
   Notwithstanding anything contained within the Schiller Park Zoning Ordinance
to the contrary, any lot, tract or parcel of land which is five or more acres
in size and which is developed as a unit under single ownership or unified
control shall constitute a planned unit development and be subject to the
provisions of this Article XXI. The foregoing requirement shall control
regardless of whether the applicable lot, tract or parcel of land is subject to
any regulations set forth in Article X through Article XX of the Schiller Park
Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05; Am. Ord. 17-4016, passed 8-17-17)
§ 155.2102 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   An application for a planned unit development shall be processed in
the same manner as an application for a conditional use and the provisions of
Article IX of this chapter relating to conditional uses, including the required
public hearing, shall apply to planned unit developments, except as modified by
the provisions of this Article.
   (B)   An application for a planned unit development shall be accompanied by
a tentative plat of subdivision which meets the requirements of the subdivision
regulations of the Village.
   (C)   The application shall also be accompanied by preliminary architectural
drawings as well as by a preliminary development plan which shall contain the
following:
      (1)   Statement of objectives and proposed use. A statement of the
planning objectives to be achieved by the particular design approach proposed
by the applicant is required. This statement should include a description of
the character of the proposed development and the rationale behind the
assumptions and choices made by the applicant. This statement should also
describe the public benefits that will be achieved through the proposed planned
unit development that would otherwise not result from a conventional type of
development or subdivision of the site.
      (2)   Statement of ownership.  A statement of the applicant's intentions
with regard to the future selling or leasing of all or portions of the land
areas or structures and the proposed use thereof is required as well as a
statement and documentation verifying that the applicant has, or will have,
ownership and control over all land included in the proposed planned unit
development is also required.
      (3)   Quantitative summary. A quantitative summary including, but not
limited to, the following is required. If the development is to be phased, the
quantitative summary must also be broken down into the phase components.
         (a)   Area in acres and square feet of the tract that is the subject
of the requested conditional use permit for a planned unit development;
         (b)   Residential density, if any;
         (c)   Total area and footprint area of principal buildings in square
feet;
         (d)   Total area and footprint area of accessory buildings in square
feet;
         (e)   Area of roads in square feet;
         (f)   Area of exterior parking facilities in square feet;
         (g)   Number of parking spaces;
         (h)   Percentage of ground cover for principal buildings, accessory
buildings, parking areas, roads, and recreational facilities — individually and

ground (open space) on site;
         (j)   Maximum residential density that would be achievable through a
conventional subdivision of the site.
      (4)   Open space statement. A statement is required describing why the
area for usable common open space was chosen, the unique advantages it offers,
and how it is envisioned that residents will utilize the space either actively
or passively.
      (5)   Traffic study. A recent traffic survey prepared by a qualified
expert setting forth and analyzing the effect upon traffic in and outside the
Village is required whenever the application contemplates a residential planned
unit development of eight or more dwelling units or a non-residential planned
unit development of 10,000 or more square feet or both. Such survey shall not
be limited to the effect on adjacent streets but shall extend to all of the
surrounding areas affected and shall indicate the anticipated points of origin
and the direction, amount and density of traffic flow to and from the proposed
planned unit development.
      (6)   Declaration. The developer shall establish an owners' association
through a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions, and easements
which will be recorded and run with the land and be binding upon every
purchaser of all or any portion of the planned unit development. Such
declaration shall be submitted to the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission
for review subject to review and final approval by the Corporation Counsel.
Such declaration shall include, but not be limited to, provisions requiring:
         (a)   Limitations on use and maintenance of land comprising the
planned unit development;

private streets or roads, detention or retention ponds and common areas and any
and all appurtenances thereto; and
         (d)   That, if the owners' association fails to maintain and repair
any and all private streets or roads, detention or retention ponds and common
areas, the Village may, but is not required to, enter upon the property to
maintain and repair such items and that the owners' association will pay the
cost thereof.
      (7)   Maps and graphics.
         (a)   Site plan. A site plan is required that illustrates the proposed
planned unit development.
         (b)   Existing site conditions. A map is required that illustrates
existing site conditions including topography, water-related features,
vegetation, wetlands, ravines, floodplains, unique soil conditions, and other
environmental data including a tree survey.
         (c)   Surrounding conditions. A map is required that illustrates the
land use and environmental conditions of the surrounding neighborhood within a
500 foot radius around the tract of land comprising the proposed planned unit
development, particularly illustrating the adjacent lots showing their lot
lines, structures, setbacks, and driveways, as well as nearby streets.
         (d)   Cross-sections. A minimum of two cross-sections are required
through the entire site illustrating the bulk and heights of proposed
structures in relation to the topography, vegetation, and surrounding
structures.
         (e)   Utility and drainage plan. A plan is required that illustrates

(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2103 STANDARDS.
   In addition to the standards generally applicable to conditional uses, as
provided in this
Article XXI herein, no planned unit development shall be approved unless the
Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall also find:
   (A)   That said planned unit development conforms with the intent and
specific proposals of the Master Plan.
   (B)   That the planned unit development will be on a tract of land under
common ownership or control. Furthermore, no tract of land located in a
residential zoning district shall be considered for a conditional use in the
nature of a planned unit development, unless it contains two or more contiguous
acres; and no tract of land located in a commercial zoning district shall be
considered for a conditional use in the nature of a planned unit development,
unless the development shall contain at least 100,000 square feet of gross
floor area.
      (1)   Such common ownership or control shall extend to all common open
space, landscaping, exterior maintenance and all other exterior common area
aspects of the development for a period of not less than 20 years.
      (2)   Said common ownership or control shall extend to all portions of
the planned unit development for a period of not less than 18 months following
the completion of all bonded improvements, common area improvements, and the
developer's relinquishing its control of any and all owners associations.
      (3)   Common ownership or control as required herein shall mean unity of
ownership or legal authority to act on behalf of all owners which shall be
evidenced by deed, declaration, contract, management agreement or other written
guarantee.
   (C)   That the uses permitted in the planned unit development shall be
compatible to each other and with existing land use in the surrounding area.
Uses shall be deemed compatible if they are authorized by the underlying zoning
district within which the planned unit development will lie and are so
designed, located, and proposed to be operated so that the public health,
safety and welfare will be protected and such uses will not cause appreciable
injury or damage to other property in the area.
   (D)   That the planned unit development will be responsive to a demonstrated
need within the community.
   (E)   That the maximum height permitted in the planned unit development,
exclusive of steeples, belfries, spires, chimneys, smoke stacks, cooling
towers, elevator bulkheads, parapet walls, and building equipment penthouses
shall not exceed the maximum height permitted for the zoning district in which
the development is located.
      (1)   Provided such buildings do not exceed 35 feet in height, the
minimum horizontal distance between buildings (including their appurtenances)
of one story, two stories, three stories, or combinations thereof, shall not be
less than 15 feet.
      (2)   In the case of buildings exceeding 35 feet in height, the space
between buildings shall be equal to the height of the tallest building from
which the measurement is taken.
   (F)   That the required yards along the periphery of the planned unit
development shall be at least equal in width or depth to the greater of the
required yard in the underlying zoning district in which the planned unit
development is located, the required yard for real property adjacent to the
planned unit development, or a distance not less than the height of the closest
building located in the planned unit development to such yard — unless such
planned unit development is located adjacent to real estate owned by the
Illinois Toll Highway Authority, in which event the yard adjacent to such real
estate shall be 50 feet.
   (G)   That residential density of the planned unit development shall not
exceed in number of dwelling units the maximum number of lots that could be
achieved through a conventional subdivision of the site as demonstrated by the
subdivision sketch plan. It is understood that whenever the development is
located in more than one zoning district, the number of allowable dwelling
units must be separately calculated for each portion of the development that is
in a separate zoning district. Thereafter the combined total of all dwelling
units so calculated as allowable may be constructed and distributed within the
entire planned unit development without concern for the respective zoning
districts within which the planned unit development is located, provided there
is compliance with building locations shown upon the site plan approved for
such planned unit development.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2104 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   In addition to the findings required for all conditional use permits in this
Zoning Ordinance, the following standards shall be utilized by the Zoning,
Planning and Appeals Commission in reviewing all planned unit development
permit applications. These standards shall be used to guide the ingenuity,
imagination, and design efforts of applicants.
   (A)   Preservation of Landscape. The landscape shall be preserved in its
natural state, insofar as practicable, by minimizing tree and soil removal, and
any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
neighboring developed areas.
   (B)   Relationship of Proposed Structures. Proposed structures shall be
related harmoniously to the terrain and to existing structures in the vicinity
and have a visual relationship to the existing nearby structures. The
achievement of such relationship may include the creative enclosure of space in
conjunction with other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the
creation of focal points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain features
or other buildings.
   (C)   Functional and Mechanical Features. Exposed storage areas, trash, and
garbage retainers, exposed machinery installations, service areas, truck
loading areas, utility buildings and structures, and similar accessory areas
and structures shall be accounted for in the design of the project and made as
unobtrusive as possible. They shall be subject to such setbacks, special
planting or other screening methods as shall reasonably be required to prevent
their being incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment and the
surrounding properties.
   (D)   Visual and Acoustical Privacy. The development shall provide
reasonable visual and acoustical privacy for each building and dwelling unit.
Fences, insulation, walks, barriers and landscaping shall be used as
appropriate, for the protection and aesthetic enhancement of property and the
privacy of its occupants, screening of objectionable views or uses, and
reduction of noise.
   (E)   Common Open Space. Each residential planned unit development permit
shall have a site plan which contains at least twenty percent (20%) usable
common open space, except as it may be modified by the Zoning, Planning and
Appeals Commission in accord with this Zoning Ordinance.
      (1)   Ineligible area. Such usable common open space shall not include:
         (a)   Areas reserved for the exclusive use or benefit of an individual
occupant;
         (b)   Dedicated streets and other public rights-of-way;
         (c)   Vehicular drives, private streets, and parking, loading and
storage areas; nor
         (d)   Strips of land less than ten feet wide.
      (2)   Access. Primary (abutting) access from such common open space to
each building site need not be provided; however, convenient access through
permanent easement must be provided and perpetually guaranteed to all residents
not granted primary access.
      (3)   Recreational facilities. The only recreational facilities permitted
within any common open space tract are those which are graphically shown on the
face of the site plan at the time of approval by the President and Board of
Trustees; provided however, that any development plan may be amended through
the procedures specified in this Article.
      (4)   Character and quality. No proposed area on a site plan may be
accepted as usable common open space unless its character and quality have been
approved by the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission. When making its
determination, the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission shall give
consideration to the following variables:
         (a)   The size and character of the structures to be constructed
within the planned unit development;
         (b)   The character of surrounding development;
         (c)   The topography and existing amenities of the proposed area,
including trees, ground cover and other natural features;
         (d)   The manner in which the proposed area is to be improved and
maintained for recreational or amenity purposes; and
         (e)   The existence of public parks or other public recreational
facilities in the vicinity and the relationship thereto.
      (5)   Ownership and maintenance. All land shown on the final site plan as
common open space must be conveyed to and maintained by a private owners'
association or similar organization formed by a condominium agreement,
declaration, indenture, restrictive covenant or other binding agreement
acceptable to the President and Board of Trustees. The legal instrument(s)
creating such owners' association must specify that the common open space and
related authorized improvements will be maintained according to the enumerated
criteria, and shall include a provision granting the Village a right to enforce
the same. In no case may common open space be conveyed to a unit of local
government or governmental agency.
   (F)   Surface Water Drainage. In conformance with the Stormwater Management
regulations of the Village, special attention shall be given to proper site
surface drainage so that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system. Surface water in
all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it will not obstruct
the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2105 PERMITTED MODIFICATIONS TO ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   In conjunction with a planned unit development permit approval, the
Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission and/or the President and Board of
Trustees in their sole discretion may recommend or approve, as the case may be,
modifications from the off-street parking, yard, lot size, lot shape, F.A.R.,
required separation between buildings, and maximum lot coverage regulations of
the zoning district governing the site as well as open space and height
regulations hereof, provided the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission and/or
President and Board of Trustees, as the case may be, determines that the
development plan complies with the Comprehensive Plan and the spirit and intent
of this Chapter. Any such modifications must be explicitly indicated in the
ordinance granting the conditional use permit in the nature of a planned unit
development, or otherwise the regulations of the underlying zoning district
within which the planned unit development is located shall control.
   (B)   The Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission may recommend and the
President and Board of Trustees may impose such additional restrictions,
conditions, or development schedules which are particularly applicable to such
planned unit development.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2106 SUBDIVISION REVIEW.
   It is the intent of this Article that applicable subdivision review under
the Schiller Park subdivision regulations be carried out as an integral part of
the review of a planned unit development permit under this Article. The plans
required must be submitted in a form which substantially satisfies the
requirements of the subdivision regulations for preliminary and final plat
approvals.
   (A)   If any provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the subdivision
regulations are in conflict, the more restrictive or detailed requirements
shall be met, unless specifically waived or altered by the President and Board
of Trustees upon recommendation of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission.
   (B)   If a subdivision is created as a part of the processing of a planned
unit development permit, the normal subdivision processing fee required by the
Schiller Park Subdivision Ordinance must be submitted to the Village, as well
as the fee for a conditional use permit required by this Chapter.
   (C)   The on-site internal street system, together with the provision and
construction of bonded improvements, shall be in compliance with the
requirements and standards set forth in the Schiller Park Subdivision
Ordinance. The President and Board of Trustees for good cause shown, upon
recommendation of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission, may permit such
changes or alterations of such standards as are consistent with the spirit and
intent of this Zoning Ordinance.

Planning and Appeals Commission, for good cause, may extend the period for
filing the final development plan for a period not to exceed an additional six
months.
   (C)   Permitted Minor Changes from a Preliminary Development Plan. Minor
changes in the location, siting, and height of structures, streets, driveways,
and open spaces may be authorized by the Zoning, Planning and Appeals
Commission to be included in the final development plan in accord with the
following procedure without additional public hearings, if such changes are
required by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the
preliminary development plan was approved. No change authorized by this
subsection may cause any of the following:
      (1)   A change in the use or character of the development;
      (2)   An increase by more than one percent (1%) in the overall land
coverage of structures;
      (3)   An increase in floor area or, in the case of residential areas, an

public hearing in order to review the proposed final development plan.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2110 CONSIDERATION OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD
OF TRUSTEES.
   (A)   Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals
Commission following the public hearing on the application for a planned unit
development, the President and Board of Trustees may by ordinance approve such
planned unit development granting the applicant a conditional use permit to
proceed in accordance with the final development plan attached thereto and all
documents in support thereof, subject to such additional conditions and upon
such terms as the President and Board of Trustees deems necessary or
appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (1)   Said ordinance shall include all standards, conditions, or
restrictions which the President and Board of Trustees shall deem necessary to
effectuate the proposed planned unit development and protect the public
interest.
      (2)   In addition to the restrictions and conditions imposed in the
ordinance approving the planned unit development, the President and Board of
Trustees shall require the execution of such declarations and easements as
shall be necessary to guarantee the maintenance of open space and include the
right to exact from the property owners the cost of such maintenance or
improvement in a legally enforceable manner.
   (B)   All public utilities and cable television transmission lines to be
provided to serve the planned unit development shall be located underground and
all bonded improvements shall be completed for each phase prior to the issuance
of occupancy permits within any such phase and in accordance with the phase
plan submitted as part of the application.
      (1)   The installation and completion of such improvements shall be
guaranteed by the deposit in escrow of the amount equal to one hundred fifteen
percent (115%) of the Village Engineer's estimate of the cost of improvements
or subdivision bonds or letter of credit in the form and as approved by the
Corporation Counsel of the Village.
      (2)   In addition to said guarantees for the installation of bonded
improvements, the Village shall require a deposit guarantee for maintenance of
the bonded improvements, which may be in cash or other suitable security of an
amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the estimated cost of such
improvements.
         (a)   This security shall be held for the purpose of guaranteeing the
satisfactory operation of the bonded improvements constructed within the
planned unit development for a period of 18 months following completion of
construction of the entire planned unit development by the developer and
acceptance by the Village of said bonded improvements.
         (b)   The security deposit herein required shall be refunded at the
expiration of said 18 month period if no defects shall have developed in the
bonded improvements; provided, however, that the Village may utilize such
deposit for the purpose of correcting defects during said period, in which case
the Village shall be required to return only that portion of the guarantee
remaining on deposit.

§ 155.2111 RECORDATION OF DOCUMENTS.
   (A)   The specific ordinance granting a conditional use in the nature of a
planned unit development as provided within this enabling legislation shall
contain a legal description of the property subject to such planned unit
development.
   (B)   Said ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of
Deeds of Cook County, Illinois, together with the declaration and such
covenants, conditions and restrictions, as may be required by the President and
Board of Trustees.
      (1)   Said covenants, conditions and restrictions, shall be in a form
which will effectuate the development of the subject property in accordance
with the planned unit development and provide for the maintenance and continued
protection of all public open space and common open space and all privately
owned common open space.
      (2)   In addition to all other interested parties, the Village may
require that said covenants, conditions and restrictions, shall run to and be

§ 155.2112 CONSTRUCTION TIMING.
   Construction of a development under a planned unit development permit shall
commence within 12 months from the date of the passage of the authorizing
conditional use permit ordinance by the President and Board of Trustees and
shall proceed to completion in accordance with the phasing program, if any,
contained therein.
   (A)   Revocation of Permits. The Director of Community Development may at
any time request written reports on the progress and development of the
proposed planned unit development project. If the Board is satisfied that the
permittee has abandoned the development of the proposed planned unit
development project, or failed to follow the final development plan, it shall
hold a public hearing for the purpose of considering the revocation of all
permits issued and action taken. Written notice of said hearing shall be sent
by certified mail (return receipt) to the permittee at the business address
stated in the application for the planned unit development permit. Publication
of said hearing shall also be given in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter for conditional uses. If the Board finds that the permittee has
abandoned the development of the proposed planned unit development project or
failed to follow the final development plan, it may then revoke the planned
unit development conditional use permit without public hearing but following
notice that such revocation will be considered by the Director of Community
Development at a meeting thereof not less than 15 nor more than 30 days after
the date of such notice. The notice specified herein shall be deemed given when
sent certified mail to the applicant at the address given in the application
for such planned unit development conditional use permit.
   (B)   Time Extensions. Upon application by a permittee of a planned unit
development, the President and Board of Trustees may extend the time for the
commencement of construction as follows:
      (1)   If a delay, or anticipated delay, is caused by governmental action
without fault on the part of the developer, an extension may be granted for a
period not longer than the period of the governmental delay;
      (2)   For good cause shown, an extension may be granted for such periods
of time as the Board deems appropriate but not exceeding 12 months exclusive of
extensions authorized under subsection (B)(1) hereinabove.
   (C)   Establishment of Common Open Spaces and Facilities. The establishment
of common open spaces and construction of public or common recreational
facilities shown on the final development plan together with the construction
of other non-residential structures shall proceed substantially in accordance
with the phasing program previously approved as part of the ordinance granting
a conditional use permit in the nature of a planned unit development.
      (1)   Occupancy permits. No occupancy permit for any structure in the
development shall be issued until a pro rata share of the common open spaces
and facilities required in compliance with the phasing plan have also been
placed in a condition suitable for use or occupancy.
      (2)   Developer responsibility. The developer shall maintain control of
all common open spaces and facilities, and be responsible for required
maintenance, until the maintenance responsibilities are formally turned over to
an owners' association. The President and Board of Trustees may determine when
the common open spaces and facilities must be formally turned over, based upon
the status of the development, when this item is not adequately addressed in
the phasing program or declaration.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2113 AMENDMENT OF THE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Any substantial change in character of any existing planned unit
development shall require the adoption of an ordinance which shall make such
changes and modifications in said planned unit development as may be approved
by the President and Board of Trustees.
      (1)   Said amendatory ordinance may be adopted only after a public
hearing by and recommendation of the Zoning, Planning and Appeals Commission in
like manner as is required herein for the adoption of an original planned unit
development ordinance.
      (2)   An amendatory ordinance shall be required in the event of any
change in the established density, location of buildings, height, or street
pattern.
   (B)   However, the Village President may approve such changes to the final
development plan in the construction of the planned unit development as in the
judgment of the Village President shall not constitute a substantial deviation
from the specific planned unit development ordinance. Before any such changes
approved by the Village President may become effective, however, the Village
President shall within seven days notify in writing the President and Board of
Trustees of such changes and the Board of Trustees shall, at their next regular
meeting, ratify the action of the Village President or deny such changes until
an amendatory ordinance has been adopted in accordance with the provisions of
this Section.
   (C)   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to indicate that the
President and Board of Trustees must pass an amendatory ordinance to grant any
changes requested.

ARTICLE XXII.
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.2201 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Article is to alleviate or prevent the congestion of the
public streets, and so promote the safety and welfare of the public by
establishing minimum requirements for the off-street parking and loading and
unloading of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which property is
put.
(Ord. 05-2539, passed 10-11-05)
§ 155.2202 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Scope of Regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of
this Article shall apply as follows:
      (1)   For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this Chapter, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
districts in which such buildings or uses are located; however, where a
building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Chapter and
provided that construction is begun within six months of such effective date
and diligently prosecuted to completion (completion to be accomplished within
18 months of the effective date of this Chapter), parking and loading
facilities in the amounts required for the issuance of said building permit may
be provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this Chapter.
      (2)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least
fifty percent (50%) of any existing deficiency in parking or loading
facilities.
      (3)   Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall
hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be
provided as required for such new use; however, if the said building or
structure was erected prior to the effective date of this Chapter, these
regulations shall not apply.
   (B)   Existing Parking and Loading Facilities. Accessory off-street parking
and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this Chapter and
located on the same lot as the building or use served shall not hereafter be
reduced below, or if already less than, shall not be further reduced below, the
requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this
